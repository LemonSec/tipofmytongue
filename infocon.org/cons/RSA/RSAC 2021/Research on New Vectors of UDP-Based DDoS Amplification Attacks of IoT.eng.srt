1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,440
- Thanks for being here

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,220
and my name is Wenmao Liu from NSFOCUS.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,090
For those who don't know NSFOCUS,

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,170
it's a security service provider

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,920
of anti-DDoS, threat
intelligence offering, et cetera.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,300
We have office in Santa Clara

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,150
and my personal sub research interest

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,360
cover IoT security,

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,869
call security and AI security.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,200
Today I'd like to talk about
research on New Vectors

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,363
of UDP-based DDoS
Amplification Attacks of IoT.

12
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,560
(mouse clicking)

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,770
So here's my agenda,

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,590
first, I'll introduce a background

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,050
of IoT-based DDoS Amplification Attacks,

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,589
and then analyze the reason

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,840
why IoT protocols are vulnerable.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,090
Then I'll show IoT devices
with these protocols

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,840
exposed to the internet at risk.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,220
Next, I'll give monitoring
results of these threats

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,199
against these IoT devices.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,260
Finally, I'll give some suggestion

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,992
to IoT vendors and enterprise CISOs.

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,100
So, what we have been seeing lately

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,820
is that IoT-based DDoS
attack are emerging.

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,479
So the first reason is that

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,400
IT, IoT and OT technologies
are converging,

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,060
for example, SDWAN and real VPN

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,540
are connecting home routers
with enterprise networks.

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,590
In the enterprise network itself,

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,370
there are printers, cameras
and sequel SCADA systems.

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,440
The number of IoT devices
are increasing rapidly,

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,910
and they are interconnecting
with each other.

34
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,953
The more assets, the more risk.

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,130
And second the reasons

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,369
that many of the IoT
devices are poorly designed,

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,520
from the figure on the left,

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,660
we can see that around
the year 2002 to 2020,

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,265
more than 10% of the CVEs are

40
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:54,060
were IOT related each year

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,220
and from the figure on the right,

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,880
we can see that most of
these vulnerabilities,

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,600
are easy to exploit

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,729
and the more than half of their impacts

45
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,490
are critical and high.

46
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,622
I would say IoT is a
trigger for the attackers.

47
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,829
As a result, in the year of 2016,

48
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,770
millions of routers,
cameras, were compromised,

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,300
and they started a record-high
1+ Gbps DDoS attack

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,380
against a bunch of famous websites,

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,109
most of many of which were taken down.

52
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,110
The botnet is now known as
Mirai and is still active now.

53
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,040
After that, we did a full scan

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,477
and found that tens of
millions of IoT devices

55
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,780
are exposed to the internet.

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,293
Obviously, the threat and
the risk are both real.

57
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,170
We found that attackers
like to use UDP DDoS

58
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,339
so they can spoof at
source at IP addresses,

59
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,170
and they prefer bandwidth efficient ways,

60
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,950
especially UDP reflection DDoS.

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,399
We use a concept of BAF,

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,390
which was defined by a paper in NDSS 2014

63
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,630
to measure the reflection efficiency.

64
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,720
Here is a list of UDP based
the vulnerable protocol

65
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,700
and their BAFs given by Nest.

66
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,673
For example, the BAF of MTP
amplification attack is 556.9,

67
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,330
which means it can produce
a malicious traffic

68
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,760
that is more than 500 times larger

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,840
than the requested traffic.

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,390
So far, the list is increasing fast

71
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,809
and a many of new items
are not mentioned by Nest

72
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,500
and the most of them are IoT protocols

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,640
and their vulnerabilities
are disclosed very recently

74
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,150
from 2017 to 2020.

75
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,920
So we have to be aware of
these new attack vectors,

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,750
once IoT protocol is
found to be vulnerable,

77
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,560
so attacker will build
an exploit, weaponize it

78
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,160
and start to attack immediately,

79
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,850
in our IoT security annual report,

80
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,359
the interval between a time
where an exploit is disclosed

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,990
and a time where a real attack is captured

82
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,373
maybe less than one day, or two days.

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,829
As a user we have been
reading news such as

84
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,993
NETSCOUT said that CoAP
attack is in the world.

85
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:25,832
Rapid7 says that Ubiquiti
protocols is being abused.

86
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,270
Trendmicro say that abuse
of WS-Discovery Protocol

87
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,320
can lead to large-scale of DDoS attacks.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,120
And we in NSFOCUS, have our own report

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,350
talking about something
you should know about

90
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,680
Open VPN reflection attacks.

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,140
And I mentioned that many
devices with ADDP services

92
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,863
are vulnerable to Ripple20 threats.

93
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,070
So what are these protocols
and why are they being abused?

94
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,543
Let's take a deeper look.

95
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,350
First let's look at the WS-Discovery

96
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,720
is a UDP-based Unicast protocol
for web service discovery,

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,380
it works as follows.

98
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,440
The client send a UDP probe
message to search services,

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,420
and then we'll find a reply.

100
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,089
How is it being abused?

101
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,790
In the worst in case,

102
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,283
attackers send a malform 3-byte request

103
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:20,283
with a payload, 3eaa, 3caa 3e
with a spoof source address

104
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,310
and the service will
reply a 1590-byte response

105
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,853
you can see here, we capture
a 3-bytes and 1,550-bytes,

106
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,859
so, it's abused because a short request

107
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,470
can trigger a much, much larger response

108
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,600
even worse, in our test,

109
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,190
we send a packet to the victim

110
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,700
and receive two packets
later due to retransmission.

111
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,560
Here, we can see two responses.

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,533
To calculate the BAF,

113
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,060
we send a payload to all services

114
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,440
exposed with the real source address

115
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,920
so that we can get the responses.

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,120
In our test, the length of the
request we send is 3-bytes,

117
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,730
and the average length of
the response we received

118
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,477
is 1,330 so the BAF would be 443.

119
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,690
Keep in mind that the BAF is determined

120
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,810
by specific requests and
its corresponding response.

121
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,920
Even we send the same request,

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,460
different server will return
responses of different length,

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,352
so the BAF might be different.

124
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,909
In March 2020, Tencent
published an article

125
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,350
about DVR being abused
for a reflection attacks

126
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,190
which we named, DHDiscover

127
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,190
as there was DHDiscover
shown in the probe message.

128
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,129
And with such attacks,

129
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,797
the DHDiscover DDoS
searched in a AlienVault

130
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,153
and file matches.

131
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,650
We searched the file IOC from AlienVault

132
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,900
and the Virus Total.

133
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,289
The first example was first
seen at December, 2019

134
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,020
and it's still acting now,

135
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,880
and the rest of example
was first seen in 2020,

136
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,313
so DHDiscover reflection
attack is very new to us.

137
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,740
Since DHDiscover support
the UDP and unicast

138
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,099
how it is abused is quite straightforward.

139
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,240
Look at the figure, it shows the response

140
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,300
including Mac address,
IP address, et cetera.

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,370
Intensity report, length of the request

142
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,240
is 62-bytes in our tests,
after sending this payload,

143
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,327
average response length
we've received is 705.30,

144
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,310
so the BAF is 11.4.

145
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,837
We have also capture
some full byte request

146
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,430
for our honeypots,

147
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,640
we send the request to
exploit DH Discover services,

148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,280
and the average response to them is 740.1,

149
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:02,749
so the BAF is a 178.5.

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,580
ADDP, shot for Advanced
Device Discovery Protocol,

151
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,490
is a UDP-based product code
developed by Digi International,

152
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,100
that allows digi devices
on a local network

153
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,920
to be found regardless of
their network configuration.

154
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,500
It's a UDP-based multicast protocol,

155
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,500
doing broadcast on
224.0.5.128 on port 1362.

156
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,179
The figure on the top-right
shows example request

157
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,962
and then text below show the response.

158
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,120
It seems to work fine since
it's a multicast protocol,

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,710
but the real problem is
that it also support unicast

160
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,500
and does not verify the source address.

161
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,380
So it's well designed
but poorly implemented,

162
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,610
in our test, the length of the request

163
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,080
that we send is 14-bytes

164
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,763
and the average length of the
response we received is 141.7,

165
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,083
so the BAF is 10.1.

166
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,810
Before the year of 2019, most
of VPN related DDoS attacks

167
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,660
are DDoS against the VPN devices.

168
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,103
If we search a key word, OpenVPN and DDoS,

169
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,500
the topic query results
in 2018 from Google is

170
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,770
DDoS attacks OpenVPN Pfsense

171
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,759
given by Google first figure

172
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,101
and as we see in the first figure.

173
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,110
The top query in 2019,

174
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,430
is how to protect your VPN
lessons from a DDoS attack test.

175
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,897
After that, this has changed,

176
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:44,940
VPN protocol, especially
OpenVPN are being abused.

177
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,580
The top query in 2020 is,

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,950
what you should know about the
OpenVPN reflection attacks,

179
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,060
which is written by us.

180
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,253
OpenVPN is a popular

181
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:59,060
application layer VPN implementation

182
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,349
based on an OpenSSL library
it works as follows.

183
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,660
After receiving a 14-byte request,

184
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,920
OpenVPN service between service
will send a 26-byte message,

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,478
so the length of the request

186
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:14,760
and the response are comparable,

187
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,430
the BAF is less than
two, which means fine.

188
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,819
In fact, the first OpenVPN
amplification attack

189
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,900
was seen by a public AntiDDoS in 2019,

190
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,680
so why is the OpenVPN being abused?

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,270
The real problem is UDP
protocol is unreliable.

192
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,560
Retransmission is
controlled by applications,

193
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,099
so how OpenVPN handle it was flawed

194
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,340
after the OpenVPN server
send the first response,

195
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,110
it will send a 14-byte response

196
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,110
in two, four, eight, 16
seconds, or every 1.5 seconds,

197
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,950
if no ACK is received
according to its configuration,

198
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,210
which means that BAF will be very high,

199
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,660
of course, you know, ACK will receive that

200
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,699
because the source address
is spoofed by the attacker.

201
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Here is a demo and we can see

202
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,850
that a server send four
responses in 30 seconds,

203
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,208
and the length, length of the request

204
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,319
that we send is 14 bytes,

205
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,987
the average length of the
response we received is 24, 26,

206
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,040
plus 14, plus 14, plus 14, and plus 14,

207
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,660
so the BAF is 5.9,

208
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,380
in some cases, that attacker send

209
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,490
a 2-byte request

210
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,080
which is captured in by our honeypot.

211
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,710
The responses are 26-byte long in average

212
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,330
so the BAF is 13.

213
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,260
CoAP, short for Constraint
Application Protocol

214
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,850
is a UDP-based web transfer protocol

215
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,230
for use with constrained
node and constrained network

216
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,423
in the Internet of Things.

217
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,270
The CoAP protocol was not
mainstream back in 2017,

218
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,410
but the number of visible CoAP endpoint

219
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,339
has increased rapidly from 2017 to 2018.

220
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,250
When the attackers send a 21-byte request,

221
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,250
NETSCOUT says that average
response length is 720 bytes

222
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,630
but in our tests, we receive
response length of 222

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,010
biasing average

224
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,450
so the BAF is 10.6.

225
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,830
In some cases,

226
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,830
CoAP with several return
516-byte responses,

227
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,613
so the BAF is 24.6.

228
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,760
Ubiquiti is also this
Device Discovery Protocol

229
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,300
designed by Ubiquiti Network.

230
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,420
The vulnerability quite straight

231
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,756
is similar to previous protocols.

232
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:54,733
So the BAF of Ubiquiti protocol is 35.

233
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,590
So we can conclude that the reason

234
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,540
why these protocol can
be abused is number one,

235
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,790
they are UDP-based,

236
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,387
number two, they support a unicast,

237
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,730
and they do not verify
the source addresses.

238
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,780
Number three, the length of the responses

239
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,310
is much, much longer than
the length of request.

240
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,760
Furthermore, the reason why they are risky

241
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,310
is not only because they are vulnerable,

242
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,532
but also because they are
exposed to the attackers.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,470
We are seeing more and more new
IoT devices on the internet.

244
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,840
The number of these devices
is increasing day-by-day

245
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,410
what does that mean?

246
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,300
Actually, we have been scanning

247
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,439
various of IoT devices on the internet,

248
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,180
round after round constantly,
as shown in the figure.

249
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,329
All of the top three types

250
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,860
have more than 60,000
exposed IoT services,

251
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,630
the number keeps increasing

252
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,710
as more IoT devices are
connected to the internet.

253
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,460
We, the security team, can
see these through assets,

254
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,337
so can the attackers,

255
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:03,390
they are discovering these IoT assets,

256
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,980
by scanners, botnets and
whatever they can use,

257
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,140
after finding vulnerable assets,

258
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,520
they can just launch
the amplification attack

259
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,053
we mentioned previously.

260
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,080
Here's a new challenge to WS-Discovery

261
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,510
DDoS mitigation, on behalf

262
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,860
and short for Open Network
Video Interface Forum

263
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,410
is a open standard for IP-based

264
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,660
security surveillance products.

265
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,959
In order to interact with other devices,

266
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,890
device discovery mechanisms,

267
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,393
which is based on WS-Discovery.

268
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:45,290
Many vendors are following
the ONVIF standard

269
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:48,619
but their implementation may be different.

270
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,470
18 Networks found that
about 46% of source ports

271
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,540
of WS-Discovery DDoS are 3702

272
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,300
but the rest are not fixed,

273
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,030
and we observed that

274
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,780
24% of WS-Discovery service

275
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,600
send the response with 93702 source ports,

276
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,412
and 4.4 of WS-Discoveries

277
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:12,480
devices and responses
with random source ports,

278
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,860
which raised a new
challenge to DDoS mitigation

279
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,920
because we cannot apply a fixed rule

280
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,260
with fixed source ports

281
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,073
and this is common among
all types of ONVIF devices.

282
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:27,910
The DHDiscover Protocol

283
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,329
also need attention because

284
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,780
it's widely deployed as the
way you see it in the table.

285
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,810
Moreover, it has a lot of OEMs

286
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,630
it's used by many vendors
in the figure on the left,

287
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,160
and the many types of devices

288
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,020
in the figure on the right,

289
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,350
once it's vulnerability is disclosed,

290
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,390
many vendor will be affected

291
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,400
and the security touch web
will be very challenging

292
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,459
for these vendors.

293
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,110
Even worse, exposed ADDP service will

294
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,110
help attacker to find that
devices affected by Ripple20,

295
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,010
ADDP is used by many different devices,

296
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,590
as shown in the figure on the right.

297
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,890
And so the attacker may first find

298
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,010
all these exposed ADDP services

299
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,990
which are very likely to be affected

300
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,680
by Ripple20 vulnerability,

301
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,540
as they easily exploit and launch attacks.

302
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,063
For those who don't know Ripple20,

303
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,900
it's a serial of zero-day vulnerability

304
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,189
that affected hundreds
of millions of devices,

305
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,980
many vendors in the list on
the right are being affected,

306
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,073
the supply chain is not reliable.

307
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,110
As a security team, we are
monitoring these threats

308
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,423
with all threat in capture system.

309
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,060
We collected data for our cloud mitigation

310
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,630
and managed add in data system

311
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,020
and then analyzed data and
generated threat intelligence.

312
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,630
I will say from our threat
intelligence centers,

313
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,340
show that in the year of 2020,

314
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,700
22% of DDoS attacks are
caused by IoT devices

315
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,293
up from 12% in 2019.

316
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
In the year of 2020,

317
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,369
14% of reflection sources in
DDoS attack are IoT devices,

318
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,683
up from five point in 2019.

319
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,170
Among all of these new types
of IoT reflection attacks

320
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,170
WS-Discovery reflection is
the most popular vector.

321
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,780
Here, the green curve here

322
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,392
and the second-highest system
is CoAP reflection attack,

323
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:37,950
the third highest is
DHDiscover reflection attack

324
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,850
and Ubiquity is not quite stable.

325
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,219
The first reason why
WS-Discovery is so popular,

326
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,220
is that it has high BAF
as we mentioned before.

327
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,230
And the second reason is that

328
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,420
attacker prefer short payload,

329
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,400
so that they can save network bandwidth.

330
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,757
We capture many DDoS requests
every day with our honeypots

331
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:06,170
and request payload are diverse,

332
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,950
the figure below shows the
percentage of payload length

333
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,800
of each type of attack,

334
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,120
in WS-Discovery attack,

335
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,120
the most use the payload
is three, four, five bytes,

336
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,530
and in Ubiquity, it's four bytes

337
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,910
in DH-Discover four bytes

338
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,040
and then OpenVPN two bytes,

339
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,973
but it's different in the CoAP case,

340
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,714
the most used payload is 21 bytes,

341
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,720
there are still one and the five bytes,

342
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,060
and we send these short
bytes to the exposed service

343
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,429
but we have not received many responses,

344
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,290
so maybe the two might not
be the attacker's favorite.

345
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,147
Comparing the, comparing that request

346
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,500
that's in the table,

347
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,420
WS-Discovery had the shortest
request, three bytes,

348
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,220
so we captured tens of millions requests

349
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,850
on daily basis in a single honeypot,

350
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,100
the attacker, who prefer short payload

351
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,850
and we received millions
of CoAP of requests,

352
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,040
hundreds of thousands of Ubiquity,

353
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,230
DH-discover requests every day,

354
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,010
but no OpenVPN, or ADDP reflection attack

355
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,260
have been captured yet.

356
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,235
Nevertheless, we do
capture nearly about 5,000

357
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:27,290
they recon from June 1st
through July 21st, 2020.

358
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,300
The top two sizes are two and 14 bytes

359
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,460
as shown in the figure on the right.

360
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,940
Here's how we distinguish

361
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,690
between a recon and a real DDoS attack

362
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,720
the key is the frequency,

363
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,410
in an OpenVPN attack,

364
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,450
we received a bunch of
requests in a short time,

365
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,520
while recon only contain
one or two requests.

366
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,700
Accordingly, we have to
update our mitigation policy,

367
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,110
either by adding rules
based on protocol type,

368
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,129
source port and the packet length

369
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,193
or using a cloud mitigation way.

370
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,980
IoT devices are definitely victims,

371
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,440
but there can also be threats,

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,030
the real attacker can use them as a botnet

373
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,203
and launch a DDoS attack
for some benefits.

374
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,800
We don't know exactly what they want,

375
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,930
maybe, extorting some companies

376
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,430
by taking their service down

377
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,240
or hiding APT attacks in
a large amount of traffic.

378
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,220
But at the least we can
find who they attack,

379
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,424
we collected the victim
IP from IoT honeypots

380
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:34,550
after calculating the geolocation

381
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,050
of the target IP address is,

382
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,060
we can see that the United States

383
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,510
suffer most from
amplified reflection DDoS.

384
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,510
WS-Discover US 47%, Ubiquity US 50%

385
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080
CoAP US 53%, and DHDiscover US 50%.

386
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,740
We know that there are business models

387
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,240
of cyber criminals,

388
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,170
for example, ransomware as a service,

389
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,210
also DDoS as a service.

390
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,930
Someone can rent on one hour DDoS

391
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,750
for just $10 on the dark web.

392
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,950
Consider it's a large quantity of business

393
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,800
and IT industrial,

394
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,100
US are the biggest target
of the cyber criminals

395
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,169
and the IoT devices become their weapons.

396
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,483
So what can we learn
from the presentation?

397
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,781
To whom who concerning IoT threats,

398
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:36,781
we have discussed just a few
IOT protocols in the slides,

399
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,601
there are many similar devices,

400
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:45,601
services Discovery protocol
can be abused by attackers.

401
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,230
It's expected that more
vulnerabilities of IOT protocol

402
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,440
and IOT devices will be
disclosed in the coming few years

403
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,730
and many new and new vectors of

404
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,683
DDOS amplification attacks
of IOT wellbeing the norm,

405
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:07,430
the data from and this
focused threat capture system

406
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,120
show that, attackers are
taking full advantage of

407
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,680
Ws discovery,

408
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,300
Ubiquity is not so
welcomed compared to CoAP.

409
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,730
However, DHDiscover has great potential

410
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,873
because it has a high
BAF and a short payload,

411
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,680
weapon lies that anniversary
will not only use

412
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,360
vulnerable IOT services,
they will also use anymore.

413
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,399
For example, the game engine
called the T sauce and inquiry

414
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,553
and that also at the remoter desktop.

415
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,479
And finally the
amplification attack is one

416
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,760
only one of the many types of IOT attack,

417
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,403
there are many more.

418
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,950
We will give some examples.

419
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,353
The first is a attacker may use

420
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,560
a password brute force attack.

421
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,750
Here are some combinations of users

422
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,370
and the password captured
by our honeypots,

423
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,889
for example router admin,

424
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,300
router antiwall, router default,

425
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,886
the minute routers are using,

426
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:20,886
oh sorry route admin route
and emptied or route default.

427
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,540
Many routers are using route admin

428
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,940
as their default login credentials

429
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,260
or the attackers can simply
use exploit for example

430
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,440
from exploit DB

431
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,770
and they find the vulnerable devices

432
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,200
and then launch attack

433
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,939
in the DNS hijack and the efficient demo

434
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,140
on the right,

435
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,630
this picture shows a demo.

436
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,820
We have a DNS hijack exploit, for example

437
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,179
and the way bought router online

438
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,830
which we know is vulnerable to the exploit

439
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,550
and then we connect it to it,

440
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,173
just like attacker find it from internet.

441
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,980
And then we use exploit
to hack into the router

442
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,810
and then change its DNS name server.

443
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,540
So when a victim connected to the router

444
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,440
and the browse website,

445
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,203
look at the red text here,

446
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,430
it's added by us,

447
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,840
it's it's fake,

448
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,540
it shows that website is fake,

449
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,879
so which means after,

450
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,320
after user browser website

451
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,040
and the input is using them or password

452
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,040
or color number whatever, and collect the

453
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,020
the submit button,

454
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,590
then the attacker gets them,

455
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,669
so the fishing is successful,

456
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,260
We do have a live video,
but it's in Chinese,

457
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,280
so I would just let say,

458
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,903
I would just let's say detail.

459
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
Here's another example.

460
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,006
We have studied that UPnP
at a subcortical family

461
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:58,960
for more than two years,

462
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,520
and we have demonstrated

463
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,280
if there are explosion, vulnerabilities

464
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,940
and the related threats,

465
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,720
in our annual IOT security report,

466
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,877
more than 2 million of
IOT devices world wide

467
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:14,360
have a UPnP SSDP service published

468
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,000
publicly accessible

469
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
and the SSDP were
vulnerable to DDoS attack,

470
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,229
how UPNP is abused is very
similar to the other protocols

471
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,170
we mentioned it before,

472
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,950
so I'm not talking about the details.

473
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,584
What I really wanted to talk about

474
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:33,260
is that UPnP port making service

475
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,080
exposed out about 390,000 IOT devices

476
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,870
is likely to be misused as a proxy

477
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,520
or vendor intranet service
accessible on the extranet.

478
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,750
Just imagine someone create
a net marking in your router

479
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,520
and they use its, vulnerability

480
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,590
and then visit the intra
internal network from internet

481
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,540
here is example, you cannot
access the internet service

482
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,080
because the router does
not allow you to do that.

483
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,750
But we can use exploit
UPnP exploit to apply it

484
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,750
create network marking from
port one, two, three, four

485
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,671
and then we can access
the internal service

486
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:25,507
from part one, two, three, four,

487
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,770
and actually it's not a made up.

488
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,770
We did a full scale of the UpnP services

489
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:34,650
from all over the internet

490
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,193
and we found that many of them
are already been compromised.

491
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:39,999
Here is a mark

492
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,640
and there is a marking on them

493
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,163
containing strong internal silence

494
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:46,870
intra scan, et cetera,

495
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,100
which shows that the attacker
are already ahead of us.

496
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,530
Whereas this established
marking the attacker

497
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,260
can either hack your
smart door lock, camera,

498
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,010
or even your gas detector

499
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,390
or the hack into your laptop
finally stay persistent

500
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,300
in your companies network,

501
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,770
it's a threat to your
personal security and safety,

502
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,003
it's also a threat to your company.

503
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,660
You may wonder why mitigating
IOT attacks is so hard

504
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,660
because IOT ecosystem is complicated

505
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,760
and there are many players,

506
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,879
governments lack IOT related mandatory

507
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,830
standard law enforcement,

508
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,520
California has already passed

509
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,650
it's Internet of Things security bill,

510
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,850
but it's still in the
early stage for minutes,

511
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,469
governments, vendors, and developers,

512
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,850
have weak concerned for security?

513
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,291
They are unwilling to spend
a $1 for security design

514
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,419
or mechanism for each device,

515
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,370
because for them any
security cost is still cost,

516
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,350
so the products poorly designed

517
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,080
and there are no security
patches or updates,

518
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,050
security service provider often find

519
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,550
it's harder to work with IOT vendors

520
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,750
because they are,

521
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,430
they have weak concern for security,

522
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,890
still there are too many
types of IOT devices

523
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,140
and protocols to secure and the vendors

524
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,880
and the users and the enterprise
lead the best practice

525
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,463
of how to configure and manage
IOT devices of their own.

526
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,500
So here is some suggestion
for IOT vendors,

527
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,270
first and foremost, hire
security professionals,

528
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,170
I can take a friend of mine for example,

529
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,350
he is a security leader

530
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,719
of a very famous video
surveillance company,

531
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,170
they are early stages products

532
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,960
user default, weak password,

533
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,677
so attacker could easily log in

534
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:45,360
and with a with a default password

535
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,889
and watch everything that we do

536
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,410
channel they want to watch.

537
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,120
He just made a small improvement,

538
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,375
the first attempt, the
user logging to the system

539
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,710
he must changed it default password

540
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,390
so it's a small change in user experience

541
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,983
but a huge step forward in security.

542
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,260
And also during the design phase

543
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,840
do not enable discovery
functionality, if unnecessary

544
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,060
if the request is a multicast,
then it's okay to reply,

545
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,270
or if there the requests
that you will use a unicast

546
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,240
and request SOPs is in
the sub same sub-net,

547
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,460
also it's okay to reply,

548
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,880
in any other cases do
not reply, do not reply,

549
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,360
it's do not reply,

550
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,719
it's very important to
me to repeat three times

551
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,510
because it used to very very important

552
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,650
for enterprise CISOs,

553
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,830
what should you do?

554
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,330
Next the week you should identify managed

555
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,960
and unmanaged IOT devices

556
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,450
with the organizations,

557
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,613
all of them because knowing
is the most important,

558
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,800
and in the first three months

559
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,389
you should follow the presentation.

560
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,980
What you should know

561
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,980
you should build a manual
workflow, three, three steps

562
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,860
first, check configurations,

563
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,649
and deployment of IOT devices

564
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,860
to make sure they are not exposed

565
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,860
to the internet extently
turn off discovery device,

566
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:37,299
to turn off discovery service if necessary

567
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,430
and then use fireworks and the white list.

568
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,137
Second, change default password

569
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:45,260
and keep device firmware up to date.

570
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,810
Three, use threat intelligence service,

571
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,490
for example Shodan or NTI

572
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,123
to monitor exposed asset continuously,

573
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,310
so hygiene is very important

574
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,580
but these are manual operations

575
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,899
and they depend on experts,

576
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,460
which is neither
consistent, not sustainable.

577
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,160
So within six months you
should do the automatic

578
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,913
and the systematic way,

579
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,120
including four steps,

580
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,120
first, build a loop, identify,
evaluate and eliminate

581
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,000
IOT security operation workflow,

582
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,393
and it's tools and systems.

583
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Second increase the IOT security
to your unified end point

584
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,220
security management solution,

585
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,130
any IOT devices, your
cameras, your printers,

586
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,530
should be treated the same

587
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,250
as the same as your laptop or your server.

588
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,120
So build a zero trust strategy

589
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,993
to allow it's work from home of your IOT.

590
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Remember the work attack path

591
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,420
from the internet to the home router

592
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,763
and to the laptop, and finally
to the enterprise network,

593
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,670
just as we mentioned before,

594
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,940
the real problem is that
there's too much trust

595
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,480
of the end point.

596
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,930
So we needed to place
a zero trust enforcer,

597
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,020
both in front of the home router

598
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,580
and in front of all the
enterprise services,

599
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,580
unless the client's credential is approved

600
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,080
it cannot access to
router or to the service

601
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,753
or it to any other services behind them.

602
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,110
And the last one is considered

603
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,149
a clouded DDoS mitigation services,

604
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,550
which cover IOT threat protection

605
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,377
if we do not have on-premise
DDAs entity DDAs device.

606
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,360
Finally I'd like to thank NSFOCUS Gewu Lab

607
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,082
and all of my colleagues,

608
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,059
including John Xing, Zhang Xing, Wei Peru,

609
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,500
Zhou Hongyi and Zhang Haoran

610
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,170
for all their excellent work.

611
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,340
And we have also some academic cooperation

612
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,120
with many excellent professors

613
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,030
professor Huang in particular,

614
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,810
we have published a
great paper based on our

615
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,803
IOT threat capture system.

616
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,710
If you have any question

617
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,110
