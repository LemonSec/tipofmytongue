1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,240
- Hi, thank you for joining us.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,650
My name is Anne Townsend.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,590
and I'm a part of the MITRE Corporation.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,830
And I'm joined by my
colleague, Michael Ekstrom,

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,040
also part of the MITRE Corporation.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,700
And we're here to talk to you
about data confidentiality

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,030
and specific data breaches.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,870
We wanted to open up with
this question for the audience

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,830
to think about for your own organization.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,683
Is your organization's confidential data

11
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,759
really confidential?

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,330
Next slide, please.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,290
Another way I like to
think of this question is

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,544
right now, could it be your organization

15
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:35,459
is sustaining a data breach?

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,390
Would you know?

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,320
Do you have the tools in
place to really understand

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,050
that it's happening or
what to do about it?

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,959
Michael and I have both
been to RSA before.

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,570
And when we spoke about
data breaches before,

21
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,750
we talked about financial impacts.

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,400
At that time, we said that
the average financial impact

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,699
an organization sustains is $3.92 million.

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,760
We're honored to be back at RSA again,

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,900
we're happy to tell you
that number has gone down

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,800
but unfortunately it's only
gone down by a small amount.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,950
Financial impact for 2020,

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,453
the average for an
organization was $3.86 million.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,169
Now I talked a lot about in the past

30
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,640
and now financial impacts

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,020
but I also want to bring out
the idea of operational impacts

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,149
and reputational impacts.

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,540
So as an organization
sustains the data breach,

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,730
they're gonna have to
refocus their resources

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,610
onto understanding what has happened,

36
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,640
can they still keep doing what
they're supposed to be doing?

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,260
Do they need to stop production?

38
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,840
So there's an operational impact

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,393
that sustained by that organization,

40
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:42,000
as well as when the information gets out

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,130
when there's news out there

42
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,723
that this organization is
having this data breach problem,

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,410
customers of that organization

44
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,300
are going to start to maybe
not trust the organization.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,899
So there's a reputational impact.

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,270
So with all of this on the line,

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,190
financials, operations, reputation,

48
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,770
organizations have to start to wonder

49
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,440
how do I handle a data breach

50
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,609
or how could I stop one
immediately if it was to happen?

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,623
Next slide, please.

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,210
So through our work

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,270
at the National Cybersecurity
Center of Excellence

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,690
which is a part of NIST,

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,600
the National Institute of
Standards and technology,

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,430
we've approached this challenge space

57
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,370
through the data security work program.

58
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,370
What we've done is we've
focused our challenge

59
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,640
really on the organization's data.

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,709
And so data, we mean anything
about an organization

61
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,530
is what it will what to keep confidential.

62
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,310
So database records, system
files, configuration files,

63
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,940
anything about their customer data.

64
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,680
These are all potential targets

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,100
of data confidentiality events.

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,370
If you look at my slide, I say attacks,

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,560
but in hindsight now that
I'm speaking here with you,

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,730
I really should be saying events.

69
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,630
So the distinction is data
confidentiality attacks.

70
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,680
We know as things like ransomware,

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,766
spear phishing campaigns,
anything with a malicious intent,

72
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:09,170
but there's also this idea
of honest human error.

73
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,899
Think about your own organization.

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,360
Do you think that's possible that someone

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,130
within your own organization
can lose their cell phone

76
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,000
or they could lose their laptop?

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,650
Well, it's out of their control.

78
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,713
Are the right capabilities in
place to protect that data?

79
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,120
So our approach has been
to effectively identify

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,110
and protect assets against
data confidentiality attacks

81
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,240
or any type of event as
well as detailed methods

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,550
that can detect, respond and recover

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,780
from data confidentiality events.

84
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,253
Next slide, please.

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,840
Okay, so that is like
the intro, the scoping.

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,900
In the next slide, I'm gonna
turn it over to Michael

87
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,560
to really dig into the technical content,

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,010
give some great demos
about what we've been doing

89
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,290
but I just wanna let everyone here know

90
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,200
where this data is coming from.

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,890
The National Cybersecurity
Center of Excellence

92
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,399
is putting together two documents.

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,590
1800-23, which is titled
Data Confidentiality:

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,830
Identifying and Protecting Assets and Data

95
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,380
Against Data Breaches.

96
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,579
For brevity in this slides,
we've abbreviated that as ID-PR,

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,230
and 1800-29 Data Confidentiality:

98
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,010
Detect, Respond to and Recover
from Data Breaches, DRR.

99
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,209
Both of these are leveraging

100
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,560
the NIST cybersecurity framework

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,680
and calling out each
one of those functions

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,383
as it relates to a data
confidentiality event.

103
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,620
Both of these documents
they develop architectures

104
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,723
to really address data breaches.

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,609
Each one of these documents
is comprised of three volumes.

106
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,880
Volume A is the executive summary.

107
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,219
It really talks about like
what are those impacts

108
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,870
that I mentioned at the beginning?

109
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,240
What organizations should be doing

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,450
about these types of problems?

111
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,840
Volume B is the much
more technical document.

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,179
And that's where a lot of the content

113
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,720
that you're gonna see in
Michael's slides is coming from.

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,330
It's gonna talk about

115
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,292
the capabilities that you
need to have in place,

116
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,559
the architectures that one should build

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,680
and what products that we used

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,580
at the facilities in
Rockville, Maryland at NCCoE

119
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,440
to build out this lab.

120
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,360
It also does a mapping to
the cybersecurity framework.

121
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,530
So that you can understand
with each capability

122
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,190
you put in with your organization,

123
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,230
how does that map to that framework?

124
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,890
Then lastly, I just wanna point out

125
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,229
that all of these publications are free,

126
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,000
they're available to the public

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,620
and they're posted on this website

128
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,800
we have listed on this slide.

129
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,070
And with that, I'm gonna go ahead

130
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,000
and turn it over to Michael

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
to really walk through
the technical components.

132
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,130
- All right, thank you, Anne.

133
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,676
So as Anne mentioned, the
information I'll be digging to

134
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:47,370
is the sort of thing you'll find

135
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,540
in volume B of our documents.

136
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,620
And I'll be going into a
bit more of a deep dive

137
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,620
on the technical recommendations,

138
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,750
including our security architectures.

139
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,610
Just a note before I get into those

140
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,340
that these builds are
currently in progress

141
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,640
and are being built in tandem.

142
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,332
So you'll see two architectures.

143
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,260
This is what we expect our final
architectures to look like,

144
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,560
but as with all things
currently being built,

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,750
they may be subject to small changes.

146
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,480
They're also meant to work together

147
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,213
and I'll talk a bit more about that later.

148
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,100
So without further ado,

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,930
let's dive into the architecture detailed

150
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,930
in NIST Special Publication
1828, Identify and Protect.

151
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,470
So as the name would imply,

152
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,990
we're looking at identify
and protect functions

153
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,293
of the NIST cybersecurity framework.

154
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,050
And we're looking to cover technologies

155
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,290
that interact with the data
breach in the early stages.

156
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,550
Ideally, we would like
to stop a data breach

157
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,810
from happening at all.

158
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,510
And we would like to
mitigate its scope and impact

159
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,163
in the early stages.

160
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,530
So as we look at this diagram here,

161
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,989
I'm going to dig a little
deeper into the bubbles you see.

162
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,920
But first, a small caveat.

163
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,410
As we build out this architecture,

164
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,930
we can't build something
unfortunately that is the exact fit

165
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,160
for every single enterprise

166
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,990
in every single industrial sector.

167
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,566
So we try and have some
of our greatest hits

168
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:18,900
in our data domain and
our example enterprise.

169
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,640
And all of these security
tools surround that

170
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,280
as it's being built in
the NCCoE virtual lab.

171
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,640
So let's start with the
internet as many problems begin

172
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,130
and drill our way downwards.

173
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,190
One of the first things
that your users will see

174
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,210
reaching out to the internet

175
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,140
and anything coming from the internet down

176
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,690
will interact with is a
browser isolation tool.

177
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,400
This is actually an example
of the collaborative nature

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,380
of the way that NCCoE projects are built

179
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,800
and was the result of
discussions and comments received

180
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,240
when this project was proposed.

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,110
The browser isolation technology,

182
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,650
what it serves to do is provide a buffer

183
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,159
between your users and the
perils of the internet.

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,380
So sites of potentially malicious nature,

185
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,380
any files being downloaded are
not immediately hosted upon,

186
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,670
well, they're hosted externally,
but then brought down to

187
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,330
and then hosted on the user's machine.

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,520
So any sort of potentially
malicious executable

189
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,890
or external webpage content

190
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,100
is displayed through
the browser isolation.

191
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,230
And if properly configured, can
stop a wide range of attacks

192
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,823
before they are able to happen.

193
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,819
From their surrounding
our entire enterprise

194
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,640
and security architecture

195
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,438
is our network protection solution.

196
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,309
In our case, we are employing one

197
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,402
that exemplifies principles
of zero trust networking.

198
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,819
The intention of this is
to provide kind of blanket

199
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,380
allow listing capabilities
across the entire enterprise.

200
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,330
So to talk across the network,

201
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,250
you have to be properly
authenticated onto a system,

202
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,280
and you have to be talking
in a authorized way

203
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,939
to another system that is also authorized.

204
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,630
So no free flowing anything
goes on the network

205
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,300
depending on how strictly it is set up

206
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,240
to protect your essential data

207
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,960
is going to do a lot to stop attacks

208
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,793
from propagating around the network.

209
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,940
From there, we're gonna
drill a little deeper

210
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,880
and look at the data itself

211
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,490
and the protections we put on it.

212
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,990
We wanna make sure that, of course,

213
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,480
we are trying to stop data breaches.

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,510
So we want robust data protection
capabilities on our data.

215
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,230
That can take multiple forms.

216
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,690
In our case, we're of
course, looking for strong,

217
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,530
secure encryption,

218
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,230
and proper user access to
that data to make sure that

219
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,100
it's not just your data's
tightly locked away.

220
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,690
It doesn't really matter
if anyone can open the box

221
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,760
or if a single stolen password

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,880
allows someone who unravel

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,660
your entire data security scheme.

224
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,560
So to mitigate that,

225
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,579
we wanna have strong user
access controls in place

226
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,160
particularly around your data,

227
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,060
but of course on the systems as well.

228
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,439
And we'll make sure we're using
multi-factor authentication

229
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,210
as we do that to make sure
that as previously stated

230
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,660
a single stolen credential

231
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,153
is not as much of a
single point of failure.

232
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,860
Now, that may seem to be enough

233
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,670
but it's not the full story

234
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,286
on protecting a single block of data.

235
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,760
For that, you also need
robust data management.

236
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,460
You need to be aware of where
your data is on the system.

237
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,490
You can have the best security
on the world on one machine

238
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,050
but if your backups of that
machine aren't similarly secure,

239
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,349
or the information that
was sent from that machine

240
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,920
to another machine or unknowingly mirrored

241
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,849
is not similarly protected,

242
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,510
then it is a massive point of weakness

243
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,470
on that data protection scheme.

244
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,610
So it's essential to know
what your important data is

245
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,530
and where it is.

246
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,410
We don't care as much
about the lunch menus

247
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,790
that are emailed around,
but certain documents,

248
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,740
protected information that
consumers have trusted you with.

249
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,500
Those are all things
we need to be aware of

250
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,650
and make sure our
protections are in place.

251
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,880
Following that up is policy enforcement.

252
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,580
We focus a little less on that this time

253
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,860
as we have in our previous documents,

254
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,943
1825 and 26 that have
been presented at RSA.

255
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,650
But we want to at least dig a little

256
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,790
into making sure our system integrity

257
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,439
and system protections are up to scratch.

258
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,750
We want to make sure that

259
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,750
if a system is known to
be on the enterprise,

260
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,250
it's plugged into our zero
trust network protection scheme.

261
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,580
We wanna make sure it's up to standards.

262
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,090
We wanna make sure that

263
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,320
there's proper USB enforcement in place,

264
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,130
proper authentication patched up,

265
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,610
good to go, everything.

266
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,270
We wanna make sure that
the machines themselves

267
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,360
that our data's resting on

268
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,560
are not our greatest point of weakness.

269
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,280
All of this that I've talked about

270
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,420
is going to tie into our locking solution.

271
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,300
This is included here
because all of these actions

272
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,060
are going to generate a lot
of data that's very useful

273
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,790
for your security team.

274
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,990
But how are we going to use that?

275
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,620
Well, I'll talk about that
with our next architecture.

276
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,403
The architecture for
detect, respond and recover.

277
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,040
The one that will be detailed

278
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,560
in this special publication 1829.

279
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,069
This is going to describe technologies

280
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,840
that will be most useful to have in place

281
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,290
after an attack has begun.

282
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,510
So we're taking it given that data breach

283
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,523
is at least partially successful.

284
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,800
Someone or something has gained a foothold

285
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,670
on the system that, or as
an previously mentioned,

286
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,492
there is some sort of accidental action.

287
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,010
And as I'm going through this

288
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,410
both for the previous architecture

289
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,980
and as I'm going through this one,

290
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,590
please, I'm happy to answer
any questions in chat

291
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,440
as we're going through this.

292
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,703
I know it's a little
bit of a breeze through.

293
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,060
So with these technologies,

294
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,540
we want to be aware of a data
breach as it's happening.

295
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,300
We don't want our
awareness of a data breach

296
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,599
to come from the FBI telling us that

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,100
a large number of credit
cards that were stolen

298
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,300
has been correlated to your location.

299
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
So you probably have a data
breach eight months ago.

300
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,160
We don't want that to be our first line

301
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
of defense and awareness.

302
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,299
We want to have ownership
and responsibility

303
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,079
for the data that has been trusted to us.

304
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,800
And that will tie into
our breach recovery.

305
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,189
Now recovery for data confidentiality

306
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,350
as opposed to data integrity

307
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,700
is a much different thing to deal with.

308
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
So when it comes to data integrity

309
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,709
and an issue like ransomware,

310
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,320
recovery is a line in
the sand you can cross.

311
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,380
You can reach a point where
your data that was destroyed

312
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,020
or corrupted has been recovered,

313
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,510
your systems has been
recovered, you trust your data,

314
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,330
you trust your systems, your
backups are all restored,

315
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,163
you're good to go.

316
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:17,210
You have recovered from
an attack of that nature.

317
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,530
Not so much for data confidentiality,

318
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,540
you can't untell a secret,
you can't ring a bell,

319
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,329
you can't undo a data
breach in that fashion

320
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,360
and of most cases.

321
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,150
So instead recovery
looks a little different.

322
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,770
What we wanna do first and foremost

323
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,550
is we want to be aware of the data breach

324
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,640
and we want to get out in front of it.

325
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,760
We wanna know the extent of the impact,

326
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,700
what sorts of files were affected.

327
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,480
Was it health data, was it
social security numbers?

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,980
Other PII, credit card numbers.

329
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,310
These are on what was
breached, who was breached,

330
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,060
where you are, where your customers are,

331
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,750
you're going to have very
different reporting requirements.

332
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,380
And all of that ties into your
recovery from a data breach

333
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,300
'cause not only are you trying to restore

334
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,729
your trust in your systems

335
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,990
and your trust in your
ability to secure data,

336
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,420
you need to convince other
people to trust your systems

337
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,750
and your ability to protect
their data all over again

338
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,050
after a data breach has occurred.

339
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,030
As Anne described,
restoring your reputation.

340
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,163
So what technologies are
going to support that goal?

341
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,230
Once again, going down from the internet,

342
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,530
we're going to have our data protection

343
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,290
and user access controls detailed again.

344
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,219
What we're gonna look more
this time at those logs,

345
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,740
that information that it generates,

346
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,440
that logging reporting monitoring.

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,810
We want to know when
the data breach happens

348
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,010
and the scope and how
we're going to stop it.

349
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,470
All this ties into event detection.

350
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,370
You can have the best intruder
detection system the world,

351
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,940
maintain perfect wellness of your data,

352
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,710
but if your security team or
somebody isn't looking at that

353
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,530
or it's not generating alerts,

354
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,310
then it's just another
footnote in a headline

355
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,439
about a data breach saying,

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,090
Oh yes, they had all these systems sliced

357
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,923
but no one looked at them,

358
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,950
which isn't helpful for anyone

359
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,290
much less reputational recovery.

360
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,089
And then that goes into mitigation,

361
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,090
understanding the scope of a
data breach and how to stop it.

362
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,770
All of this ties into effective recovery

363
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,100
doing proper data preach recovery

364
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,510
and doing it right the first time.

365
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,819
So you don't have to go back and revise

366
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,520
which files were affected,
which users were affected

367
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,613
and the scope of an incident.

368
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,910
And once again,

369
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,020
sorry, I'll go back a moment,

370
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,810
if there are any questions
regarding this architecture,

371
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,219
I'm happy to answer them in
chat as I go into our use cases.

372
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,120
So these things aren't just built

373
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,566
in the NCCoE virtual laboratory.

374
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:51,690
Hence look at it, say,

375
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,690
oh, that's probably good enough,
and move on with our day.

376
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,850
We test these architectures.

377
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,530
And the way we do that
is through our use cases.

378
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,970
These use cases are meant to simulate

379
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,800
various data breach scenarios

380
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,883
that you might see out in the wild.

381
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,079
Throughout all of them,

382
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,750
we seek to test various
different sorts of attack vectors

383
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,260
and means of data exfiltration.

384
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,260
So you'll see examples of both
intentional malicious action

385
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,040
as well as some things
that could be marked up

386
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,373
to simple carelessness,

387
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:28,980
losing a laptop, that is a use case.

388
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,870
And from looking at those
scenarios, we want to dig into

389
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,590
how we are going to respond,

390
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,013
how architecture is going to
stack up to the challenge.

391
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,100
So let's take a look at the first use case

392
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,023
I'm going to discuss today
exfiltration of encrypted data.

393
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,010
So we take it as a given in this use case

394
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,620
that two things are true.

395
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,399
One, you have a trusted enterprise.

396
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,550
It is secure,

397
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,180
your organizational
operation is going well,

398
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,420
your data is well protected,
everything is fine.

399
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,380
We also assume that

400
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,400
there is some sort of
acquisition of resources.

401
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,810
Maybe it's a new employee,

402
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,620
maybe we're bringing a new
laptop into the system,

403
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,439
employees bringing their own device,

404
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,970
maybe there's a corporate
acquisition or merger.

405
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,500
Whatever the story may be,

406
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,160
new assets are being brought

407
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,520
into your perfect uncompromised
trusted enterprise.

408
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,060
Unfortunately, it is not the case

409
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,060
that all of the new machines
should be similarly trusted.

410
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,800
One of the new machines
has a backdoor on it

411
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,530
that has already been put
in place by an attacker

412
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,330
and is constantly leaking data
back to a malicious server.

413
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,300
So that machine is going to be
brought into the enterprise.

414
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,379
And any time that data is
generated on that workstation

415
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,480
or data passes through that workstation

416
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,785
throughout the everyday
use of that machine

417
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,150
doing business operation

418
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,380
is going to be subject to exfiltration.

419
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,300
It's gonna be constantly brought back

420
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,100
from the workstation to the server

421
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,449
controlled by the attacker.

422
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,980
Nice diagrams and checklists
are all good at all

423
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,000
but let's take a look at
what this actually looks like

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,773
with a short video.

425
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,430
So here, there are two things going on

426
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,850
on the screen in front of you.

427
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,639
To the left is the user's workstation

428
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,170
that is assumed to be
compromised in some fashion,

429
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,083
to the right is an
attacker controlled system.

430
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,223
And I'm going to narrate as
we look through this video.

431
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,750
So first things first,

432
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,870
the user is going to
look through their files,

433
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,399
see that everything is in order.

434
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,653
Their very, very essential
company data, as you can see,

435
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,190
is in their documents,
everything's going fine.

436
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,630
Unfortunately, the attacker

437
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,350
has some sort of executable
running, some sort of script,

438
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,770
and all of the data that is
currently on their system

439
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,350
is privy to the attacker
over on the right.

440
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,770
But that's not the full story.

441
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,530
This is not a simple one-shot data breach,

442
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,763
this is a constant exfiltration.

443
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,660
And here the user's
going to create new notes

444
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,150
in the course of their daily
duties in unencrypted form

445
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,220
because this is the unsecure
version of the scenario.

446
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,170
And that data is going to once again,

447
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,660
be visible to the attacker

448
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,510
almost as soon as it was
created and saved to the system.

449
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,380
So what can we do about
this sort of scenario?

450
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,000
This is entirely transparent

451
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,713
to the user in the way
that they can't see it.

452
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,870
Opaque in the fashion that they
don't know what's going on.

453
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,790
They received no feedback,

454
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,409
no stuttered operations on their system,

455
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,090
no big flashing ransom note

456
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,980
saying their machine has been compromised.

457
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,710
It is up to the organization

458
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,020
or several months later the FBI

459
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,120
to realize that there is some
sort of data breach going on.

460
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,070
So how are we going to do that?

461
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,419
Let's do take a look at
both of the architectures.

462
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,430
So as I mentioned,

463
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,353
both of these architectures
are being built in tandem.

464
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,540
And over the course,

465
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,540
I know that we don't have
time to delve too deeply

466
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,950
in each of these scenarios.

467
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,610
But if anyone has any further questions,

468
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,139
I'm happy to expand further
in the chat as I speak.

469
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,340
So here we look at both architectures

470
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,290
which are being built simultaneously

471
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,860
and in a way to demonstrate
how they can work together.

472
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,830
So these would actually
be overlaid and combined

473
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,689
but for the sake of visual
clarity, they are separate.

474
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,410
That's also why we publish two guides

475
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,840
so it's more readable and easier to adopt

476
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,830
and consider the different
technologies you need

477
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,842
and their benefits.

478
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,920
So starting on the left,

479
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,450
that's the identify and
protect architecture

480
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,893
that I discussed earlier.

481
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,750
So highlighted in purple is
the data protection capability.

482
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,100
That's something that
would have been very useful

483
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,149
to have in this scenario.

484
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,983
As I mentioned,

485
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,793
all that data being thrown
around was unencrypted.

486
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,653
The simple cause of having,

487
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,990
the scenario of having a data breach

488
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,410
with encrypted versus unencrypted
data is very different.

489
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,980
It's still, of course,
a serious compromise

490
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,760
and incident that needs to be reported.

491
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,399
But it's much less privy
depending on your encryption

492
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,659
or organizational policies.

493
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,219
But it's a much different scenario

494
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:44,700
where you don't know that data is accessed

495
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,160
immediately available to an attacker.

496
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,890
And in general, you're
in a much better scenario

497
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,160
both from your organizational policies

498
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,430
or organizational standpoint,

499
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,830
trusting your data on what happened

500
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,062
and your consumers trust in you.

501
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,140
Tying it to that is that
data management capability

502
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,520
I talked about.

503
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,450
In the case where something
like this happens,

504
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,550
you want to be aware
of what data was where,

505
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,437
but it also pays to not
have an enterprise setup

506
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:17,090
that single end-user workstation
has to be set up in a way

507
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,870
that every single piece of
data in your organization

508
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,860
can be trusted in an
unencrypted form on that.

509
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,550
Being able to know where
your essential data is

510
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,493
and treat those machines accordingly.

511
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:33,820
Of course you don't want to
have a scenario like this,

512
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,250
but it's better to have a scenario where,

513
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,550
a setup in your organization

514
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,649
where a single compromised
laptop does not give privy

515
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,060
to all your organization's data,

516
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,220
it doesn't flow freely

517
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,870
through every single end-users machine.

518
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,590
And of course, at the end of the day

519
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,560
mitigation is very important here

520
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,909
because we want to make sure
that we have the ability

521
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,160
to recognize what's going on and stop it.

522
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,930
As data is moving around your enterprise

523
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,300
and out of your enterprise,

524
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,760
those are things that can create events

525
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,720
through our locking tool.

526
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,819
And once those events are recognized

527
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,889
and brought to the attention
of the security team,

528
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,683
they'll have the tool to
stop that data breach.

529
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
So without further ado,

530
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,460
let's move to our next
use case, eavesdropping.

531
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,860
In this case, the easiest way to visualize

532
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,729
what's happening here

533
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,460
is somebody walks into the
lobby of your organization

534
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,460
or room, maybe a job interview,

535
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,990
maybe someone working for
another company in the building,

536
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,230
maybe someone completely unaffiliated

537
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,480
plugs themselves into
the wall or to the WiFi

538
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,293
and gains access to the network.

539
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,680
This in itself does not
immediately give them access

540
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,240
to all the data that
flows across the network,

541
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,570
but it does give them the
opportunity to conduct an attack.

542
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,610
I'll demonstrate an arc spoofing
attack against the router.

543
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,959
That's going to let them
put themselves in line

544
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,970
between a user workstation
and the company intranet.

545
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,019
So anytime that employee
uploads a sensitive file,

546
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,570
maybe discussing some sort

547
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,679
of intellectual property proposal,

548
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,520
the attacker's going to be able to capture

549
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,830
and view the file.

550
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,770
Once again, the user's not
going to be necessarily aware

551
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,370
that anything went wrong.

552
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,620
The attacker can simply
look into and copy traffic

553
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,770
and doesn't need to take it

554
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,290
and run out the door giggling maniacally.

555
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,030
They are able to do this in a way

556
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,473
that they are not immediately detected.

557
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,590
So let's take a look again
at what this looks like.

558
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,060
On the left, the user,

559
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,240
on the right, some sort of attacker

560
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,910
who has gained access to the network.

561
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,860
The attacker is going to use

562
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,060
the conveniently named Arpspoof tool

563
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,060
to execute an Arpspoofing
attack against the router.

564
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,400
This is going to allow them to capture

565
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,610
any network traffic that
is flowing to and from

566
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,399
the company intranet.

567
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,340
They're going to open their tool here

568
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,429
so that they're able
to capture any traffic

569
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,213
as it crosses the network.

570
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,700
And over on the left,

571
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,750
separately, the user's
going to be uploading

572
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,023
some sort of sensitive file
to the company intranet.

573
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,830
I'll put down in description
for good record keeping

574
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,860
and so the attacker knows
exactly what they're handling,

575
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,080
and they will go on and upload a file.

576
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,270
Once again for the purpose
of this demonstration,

577
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,837
the file is unencrypted

578
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,710
and the connection is
not protected as well.

579
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,300
And this will demonstrate exactly

580
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,629
why that is a problem in this case

581
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,640
and why the sort of build architecture

582
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,340
that we're gonna recommend

583
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,550
will have those sorts of protections.

584
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,080
So here, the attacker is gonna say,

585
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,919
oh, hey, there was a nice network

586
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,379
communication happening here.

587
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,870
And they're able to view
and download the file

588
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,320
for their own use

589
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,923
as they leave giggling
maniacally out the door.

590
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,073
Once again,

591
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,260
our architectures are going
to be able to interact

592
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,010
with this at several stages.

593
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,879
Our zero trust network protection tool

594
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,460
is going to be very
helpful in this scenario,

595
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,370
and it's going to make it so that

596
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,360
unauthorized network connections
are simply disallowed.

597
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,810
So for example,

598
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,440
someone walks in, plugs their
computer into the network,

599
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,460
that computer is not supposed to be there,

600
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,430
they are not authenticated as a user

601
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,620
that has any sort of
permissions on the network,

602
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,300
they are not allowed to connect to things

603
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,389
that they shouldn't which
in this case is nothing.

604
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,980
So unless they have gone
through a legitimate channel,

605
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,330
they have no access at all.

606
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,760
And even if they do gain
access in some fashion

607
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,720
that they're not able to
access the entire network.

608
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,050
So that's going to stop
a lot of the capability

609
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,440
for any sort of data breach to happen

610
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,190
through an attack vector like that.

611
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,810
Though once again we are in a scenario

612
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,730
where if this happens,

613
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,650
it is completely unknown to the user

614
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,980
and the security team unless
they're looking for it.

615
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,660
So that event detection tool

616
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,120
particularly looking at things
moving across the network,

617
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,090
movement of data and
activities across the network,

618
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,290
it's going to be very important

619
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,440
to recognizing that a data
breach happened at all,

620
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,543
and be able to take the steps
to do anything about it.

621
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,580
So I'm happy to answer
questions in the chat about that

622
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
as I moved towards the last use case

623
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,793
I'll be going in to
in-depth detail about today,

624
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,610
which is ransomware.

625
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,959
So we've talked about ransomware
RSA a few times before

626
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,760
but not as much through the lens

627
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,080
of a data confidentiality attack.

628
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,770
Previously, when we've used ransomware

629
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,450
to test our architectures at the NCCoE,

630
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,920
we've modeled it more
after worm-like ransomwares

631
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,390
such as WannaCry and Neopeche
that seek to self propagate

632
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,283
and hit as many targets as possible.

633
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,970
That is not the only flavor of ransomware

634
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,970
that exists these days.

635
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,215
Ransomware such as Sodinokibi and Ryuk

636
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:03,949
are examples of things
that involve more attacker,

637
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,210
well, involvement more researched attack,

638
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,070
more awareness of the
network they're attacking,

639
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,960
more specific targeting of
essential network resources,

640
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,010
things like your backups which
would have been very useful

641
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,410
if they weren't targeted
by a ransomware attack.

642
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,219
So we're going to see an example here

643
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,840
where the attacker is much more involved

644
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,240
in the ransomware attack.

645
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,840
So what you'll see in the
video I'm about to show you

646
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,502
is a user is going to visit a site

647
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,100
that resembles an organizational resource.

648
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,240
In this case, the Office
365 Outlook window

649
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,050
and they're going to
attempt to authenticate.

650
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,389
They were misled to a site
either through a phishing email

651
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,070
or some other means of deception

652
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,740
that's going to make it

653
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,280
so that they are inputting
their credentials

654
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,980
or in our case, administrator credentials

655
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,360
because that's more fun

656
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,560
into an attacker controlled resource.

657
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,820
Attacker will steal those credentials

658
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,720
and they'll be able to use that,

659
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,650
and while gaining access to the network

660
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,650
to gain access to resources,
download and run ransomware.

661
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,420
That ransomware is gonna
generate an encryption key,

662
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,083
send it back to the home server.

663
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,520
But there's a bit of a catch here

664
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,600
'cause the ransomware in addition

665
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,500
to whatever ransomware will do

666
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,940
is going to make the claim
that files have been stolen.

667
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,903
And let's take a look
at what that looks like.

668
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,950
So here, the victim is going
to visit a phishing site,

669
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,580
and input the highest
credentials they know

670
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,284
'cause it makes the
demonstration a little more fun.

671
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:41,660
And unfortunately,

672
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,330
they are going to not
realize what's happening

673
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,550
'cause they're immediately redirected

674
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,399
to the proper Outlook site,

675
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,120
but their credentials were
stolen by the attacker.

676
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,989
They're able to log in,

677
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,823
but at the same time,

678
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,750
the attacker is going to be
able to find their unencrypted

679
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,873
and very secure A, B, C, D,
one, two, three, four password,

680
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,710
and use that in gaining
access to the network.

681
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,720
Once the user logs in as an employee

682
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,940
or wherever they want to go

683
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,220
if they have a administrative password,

684
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,450
they're going to call back to their server

685
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,300
and start getting some
resources they'd like to have.

686
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,528
One of them will be ransomware
which they will then run.

687
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:23,723
The other will be a ransom note.

688
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,450
So in addition to any
sort of destructive action

689
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,040
happening from the ransomware,

690
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,909
this is also a data breach,

691
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,480
which is up to the organization.

692
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,930
Well, it looks like in this case,

693
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,517
the attacker is very
willing to provide proof

694
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,830
that a data breach has occurred.

695
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,949
But it costs an attacker nothing

696
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,240
to run ransomware as it always would

697
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,350
not go through the trouble
of sealing data and say,

698
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,919
oh, by the way, I also stole your data.

699
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,712
So even if you recover,
I still want my Bitcoins

700
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:55,250
or otherwise I'm gonna post
it all over the internet.

701
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,840
In this case, it's already
posted all over the internet.

702
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,570
But once again, we're in a scenario

703
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,770
where it is on the organization

704
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,520
to determine if a data breach
occurred and the scope of it.

705
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,879
And that is all on top of
any sort of other destruction

706
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,570
that came along with
that ransomware attack.

707
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,370
So in this case, robust,
reporting, locking

708
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,500
and monitoring tools are essential

709
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,320
to determine did a data breach occur,

710
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,790
and to what extent did it occur,

711
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,013
and then determining the steps
going forward from there.

712
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:28,879
In this case, it also would have been nice

713
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,720
to have browser isolation tools in place

714
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,060
to provide an additional
layer of protection

715
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,780
for users browsing the web.

716
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,780
As well as if the web
was an essential aspect

717
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,510
of that use case in terms of
bringing the ransomware down

718
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,730
then the browser isolation

719
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,310
would have helped a lot in that scenario

720
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,620
and made it so that a malicious executable

721
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,970
either through accident or intent

722
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,360
would have been able to be stopped.

723
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,969
So I'm happy to answer
more questions about that

724
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,650
but given the time,

725
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,280
I'd like to quickly go through
the remaining use cases

726
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,370
that we'll be using for these projects.

727
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,239
We were looking at spear phishing,

728
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,730
particularly as an attack factor,

729
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,480
but also other destructive data breaches

730
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,700
that can be executed through them

731
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,740
as well as some less malicious examples

732
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,050
where there's either a malicious employee

733
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,129
or just simply mistaken
employee, an accidental email,

734
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,223
or someone sends an essential
file to the wrong person,

735
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,360
either inside or outside the enterprise,

736
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,449
a lost laptop, where you need to determine

737
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,790
what data was on a system
and what your next steps are.

738
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,149
Privileged misuse where
someone gains credentials

739
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,570
they shouldn't have and prints
off files or X-Force rates

740
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,520
to a USB drive and tries
to walk out the door.

741
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,879
These are all use cases
that are good to consider

742
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,573
when you think about your
organization's data security.

743
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,263
At the end of the day,

744
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,070
any of these could happen,
none of these could happen,

745
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,560
something adjacent or completely
unrelated could happen.

746
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,790
But it pays to think
through both the scenarios

747
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,270
and the security technologies.

748
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,040
And that's what we try to
describe through our documents

749
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
to think about what you
need in your organization

750
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,589
to make sure your data is really secure.

751
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,409
And with that to discuss
what you can take away

752
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,540
from today's presentation,

753
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,293
I am turning it back over to Anne.

754
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,029
- Thank you, Michael.

755
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,739
I hope with what we've been
able to present here today

756
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,929
that next week maybe you
can start to think about

757
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,399
some of these components

758
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,179
and reassess your own organization's

759
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,169
data security capabilities.

760
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,003
It would also be great

761
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:42,429
if you joined the NCCoE Data
Security Community of Interest.

762
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,540
In our concluding slide,

763
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,690
we have email address on how
to do that and how the website.

764
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,139
But we really leverage
our community of interest

765
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,589
to help us identify

766
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,830
what's the next big
data security challenge

767
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,223
that organizations would
like us to focus on.

768
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:58,680
And the first three months
following this presentation,

769
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,899
perhaps you'll be able
to begin enacting steps

770
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,070
to mitigate, accept,

771
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,150
or otherwise deal with
these types of risks

772
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,030
that your organization may have.

773
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,210
And perhaps provides
a better understanding

774
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,750
what capabilities your
organization's technologies

775
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,900
are providing.

776
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,990
And we're hoping you're able to understand

777
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,810
what security controls may need

778
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,009
to still be addressed
within your organization.

779
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,843
Within six months,

780
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:22,670
you should begin to
incorporate potentially

781
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,390
some new capabilities to strengthen

782
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,970
your own organization's ability
to provide data security,

783
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,629
and perhaps a better response plan.

784
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,580
Next slide, please.

785
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:38,529
And so we hope that today
provided some education

786
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,420
that helps provide
strategies for data security.

787
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,930
We hope that you're able to learn

788
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,759
how to understand these strategies

789
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,430
and how you could apply it
to your own organization,

790
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,410
and then really in that applying it

791
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,589
to your own organization,

792
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,800
bring back to your organization
some new approaches

793
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,603
to resolve data security challenge.

794
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,200
Next slide please.

795
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,162
So to leave you with
our contact information,

796
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:03,596
that website link listed on this slide,

797
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:06,120
that's where you can get
a lot of the documentation

798
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,880
that we have produced
or discussed here today.

799
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,470
I wanna highlight that Bill
Fisher, who is with NIST,

800
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,060
he is our principal investigator

801
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,158
for all data security programs,

802
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:19,990
as well as there's contact info
Michael's and mine as well.

803
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,839
And then also if you'd
like to just reach out

804
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,200
