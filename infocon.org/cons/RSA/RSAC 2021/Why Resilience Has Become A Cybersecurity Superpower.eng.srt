1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,189
- Thank you so much
everybody for being here

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,860
for my session on why resilience

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,420
has become a cybersecurity superpower.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm Lisa Young, I'll be your
host for this talk today.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,960
And I was invited here because of my role

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,129
as an I.S.C2 Board Member.

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,526
I serve on the Board of
Directors for I.S.C2.

8
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:21,450
And I also work for company,

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,540
I'm vice president of
cyber risk engineering

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,380
for a company called Axiom.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,840
But I wanna make sure that you know

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,980
is that the opinions in
this presentation are my own

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,330
neither those of my employer or I.S.C2,

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,030
so thank you again for being here.

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,100
Okay, so hold on a second
let's get the controls, right?

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,160
All right, everybody, so this is me.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,970
So I'm not gonna spend a
lot of time on this slide.

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,170
I just want you to know that

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,660
I am quantitative risk
data-driven problem solver.

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,599
And I believe that cyber risk
management is a team sport.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
So everything that I talk
about today is gonna be

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,940
how do we make our team stronger?

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,430
How do we build our muscle?

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,460
How do we make sure that, you know,

25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,080
we bring fresh ideas and fresh talent

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,670
to the cybersecurity workforce
and to our talent pool.

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,560
The slides for this
presentation will be available

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,150
and what that means is
that I've put in some links

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,320
and some other things, some search quotes

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,369
and some things on this slide,
I've put in my LinkedIn email

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,720
and the purpose there is for
you to get in touch with me.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,200
I do interact a lot with the community

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,840
and I wanna make sure that

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,640
if there's something that
I've said that's not clear

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
or you wanna know something about,

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
please by all means reach out to me.

37
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,030
All right, let me start first
with a couple of definitions.

38
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,690
And I believe this is
important because cyber,

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,600
the word cyber is an adjective, right?

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,600
And so it modifies the word
that, you know, follows it.

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,640
And it gives more specific information

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,060
about the thing you're talking about.

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,150
So cybersecurity, cybercrime,

44
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,120
cyber risk, cyber
resilience, cyber threat,

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,040
so we use the word cyber a lot.

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,950
But what I wanna put it in the context of

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,270
is all of our relating to
computers, information technology,

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,350
any kind of digital communications.

49
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,140
And risk just as a term
means exposure to danger,

50
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,972
harm or loss.

51
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:18,000
Risk may or may not materialize.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
And when you put those
two things together,

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,269
typically cyber as the
modifier in front of risk,

54
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,900
means that it's unauthorized
access or unauthorized use

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,170
or there's some other nefarious elements.

56
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,280
So I just wanna set that up.

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,650
But the reason I start
there is because cyber is,

58
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,200
I always like to enrich
the definition of cyber

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,019
to cyber-physical.

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,390
And the reason I do this is
that cyber-physical and digital,

61
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,450
because we live in a digital world.

62
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,160
Even though digital meaning non tangible

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,299
is connected to our physical world.

64
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,560
So this notion of cyber-physical, okay?

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Is very important of from a
building your cyber muscles,

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,010
building your superpower
in risk management,

67
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,660
building your resilience superpowers.

68
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,829
And I put a little reminder
on the bottom of this slide,

69
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,230
everything that is in
our digital world today

70
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,369
is based on the O.S.I model.

71
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,370
So the O.S.I model is the Open
Systems Interconnection model

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,840
and it's the basis for
all digital communication.

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm not gonna talk about
it in this presentation

74
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
but if you wanna think about
anything related to digital,

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,779
digital communications, our
connectivity, cyber-physical,

76
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,990
it really is about the O.S.I model

77
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,650
and it's the basis for
all digital communication

78
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,023
whether that communication
is authorized or not, okay?

79
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,300
And this slide just sort
of builds it out further

80
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,270
and makes it more real, right?

81
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,590
So when we think about hardware, software.

82
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,050
The connectivity between
hardware and software

83
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,610
our smartphones, our smart
home, our manufacturing,

84
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,170
healthcare, transportation,
our cars, right?

85
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,959
I mean our cars talking to one another,

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,323
our cars talking to tollbooths,
our cars talking to,

87
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,420
you know, this notion of
cyber-physical systems

88
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,940
in our digital world.

89
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,640
Sometimes you hear the terms,
I.o.T, internet of things.

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,880
Sometimes you hear
electronic control units,

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,270
printed control boards.

92
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,500
All of those things are about
the cyber-physical world,

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,910
and there's a lot of
untapped, both connectivity

94
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,613
and complexity in what we do today.

95
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,710
So one thing I'll mention is
that if you have any questions

96
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,810
by all means, put them in the chat window.

97
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,299
I'm gonna try to remind you

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,910
as we go through this presentation,

99
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,990
that as you think of things

100
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,690
or you just want something answered,

101
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,763
please do put them in the chat window.

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,680
So my personal sort of sense
here is that, you know,

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,340
I'd like to set the context for cyber risk

104
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,150
and I'd like us to think
about cyber-physical

105
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,419
digital world and taking
ecosystem view, okay?

106
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,890
That notion of conditions and consequences

107
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,659
and I'll talk more about that.

108
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,110
And I really do believe that
all roads lead to risks,

109
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,920
but I don't believe
everything is a risk, okay?

110
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,490
So I realize this is a
little bit of a busy picture,

111
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,660
so I'm gonna spend a little time on it

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,000
because I think it really
is the basis for moving

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,030
from a sort of a mental model

114
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,130
of cyber as a technology problem

115
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,700
or cyber as a limited scope problem

116
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,280
and expanding the view to risk management

117
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,869
and then getting to the
resilience sort of mindset.

118
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,680
So starting from the left,

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,440
let's talk about services and products.

120
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,150
Every organization, whether
it's public, private,

121
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,570
government, military,
for profit, non-profit,

122
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,140
whatever kind of organization

123
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,719
that you find yourself operating in,

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,670
it delivers a service or product

125
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,090
meaning it exists to serve some mission

126
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,859
or deliver a service or deliver a product.

127
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,170
And within the context of that
business or that enterprise,

128
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,100
or that organization, again
for money, for non-profit,

129
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,500
doesn't make any difference.

130
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,210
You do activities.

131
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,169
Now in this slide, I've labeled
those productive activities

132
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,050
or business processes.

133
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,550
Some organizations call them projects,

134
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,340
some call them functions,
some call them initiatives.

135
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,330
There's a lot of
different words to be used

136
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,680
to describe the things that
we do to deliver the services

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,120
and products to our
constituents, our customers.

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,090
And those products and
services use assets, right?

139
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,380
So in this diagram, the
things in the middle

140
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,640
are the people assets, people as an asset,

141
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,659
people to deliver the service or product,

142
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,620
people's brains to think
it up, information assets,

143
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,520
technology assets, facility assets.

144
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,440
That's where the service
or product is performed

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
or delivered or transported or stored.

146
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,010
Supply chain.

147
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,450
Third-party risk management.

148
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,200
Supply chain could be partners

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,800
who help you do part of the
service or product delivery,

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,450
or they could be the supply chain,

151
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,940
they could be the raw
materials that you use

152
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,870
in the delivery of your product.

153
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,840
And the examples on the bottom right,

154
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,679
but all of those productive activities,

155
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,310
business processes and
functions use assets

156
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,120
for the purpose of delivering
the organizational mission.

157
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
And what we do as security professionals

158
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,050
is we do a lot of the activities

159
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,840
that are in the bottom right.

160
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,010
And I call those in this diagram

161
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,630
I call them risk
management processes, okay?

162
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,270
You could call them cyber
risk management processes.

163
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,099
You could call them what they
are, application security,

164
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,320
you know, access management,
identity and access management,

165
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,560
all kinds third party risk management.

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,690
A lot of the activities
that we do in this domain

167
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,690
are designed to keep the
assets in their intended state

168
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,460
so that they can continue to deliver

169
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:08,743
the products and services, okay?

170
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,430
Now risk management, okay?

171
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,290
Risk management, so thinking about moving

172
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,670
from a controls based
sort of management of risk

173
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,670
to a uncertainty based or a
forward-looking view of risk.

174
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,450
Every time you hear the word risk,

175
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,000
you should think about uncertainty.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,110
And risk management is the ongoing process

177
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,169
of adopting some kind
of a holistic approach.

178
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,339
And the reason why I'm so
keen on moving from cyber

179
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,290
to cyber risk to risk to resilience

180
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,410
is because we do need
to take a more holistic

181
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,959
and multidisciplinary approach

182
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,810
to solve some of our problems.

183
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,339
The reason why the theme
this year is resilience

184
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,340
is because it is an all
encompassing sort of mental model

185
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,160
about how do we get to
a place of being able

186
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,260
to keep our knees bent

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,500
and make sure that we're proactive, okay?

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,190
So this notion of establishing
a repeatable process

189
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,700
to minimize and mitigate loss

190
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,170
is the definition of risk management.

191
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,343
Now drilling down a little bit,

192
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,210
this notion of risk assessment
is often the shortcut term

193
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,043
that we use.

194
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,730
We call everything a risk assessment,

195
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,250
a risk and control self-assessment

196
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,100
or a risk and a risk
assessment, a gap assessment,

197
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,770
a compliance assessment, a risk, you know,

198
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,120
we use the term risk assessment a lot.

199
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,150
But let me just ask you to back up

200
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
and say risk identification I
think is equally as important

201
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,990
as risk assessment, okay?

202
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,140
And risk assessment is usually comprised

203
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,810
of the functions of identify,
analyze, and manage.

204
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,209
So risk assessment is
often a term that we use

205
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,350
to mean risk identification,
risk analysis,

206
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,690
or, you know, risk
management, risk response,

207
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,150
risk treatment.

208
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,430
What I wanna say here is I
believe that risk identification

209
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,989
is one of the most important
sort of superpowers

210
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,220
that you can develop,

211
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,410
that you may not be actively doing today.

212
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,670
You may be doing a risk
and control self-assessment

213
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,860
or a control self-assessment.

214
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,320
But what I'm gonna say
is risk identification

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,633
is about looking at the conditions.

216
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,820
The tips and tricks for doing
some of these techniques

217
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,860
are in the boxes on the
bottom right of this slide.

218
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,020
So for identification, you
might look at that R.C.S.A

219
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,090
as a risk and control self-assessment.

220
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,130
You may also do interviews,

221
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,970
you may also ask people what
they're concerned about.

222
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,220
You may also do some brainstorming
or tabletop exercises

223
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,610
to identify what people are concerned.

224
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,630
These are the conditions that
people are concerned about.

225
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,830
Conditions are things like
threats, vulnerabilities,

226
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,140
areas of weakness, insider
threat might be a condition.

227
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,500
And a lot of times we
spend time on understanding

228
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,640
what is the probability of
some threat materializing

229
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,650
or what we might also
wanna take a look at is

230
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,319
how susceptible are we.

231
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,890
How susceptible are we
in our organizations

232
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,990
to some weakness, okay?

233
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,250
So there's that uncertainty factor.

234
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,250
And then the other side of the equation

235
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,070
for risk identification and assessment

236
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,050
is this notion of consequence or impact.

237
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,329
And consequence or impact
is what the organization

238
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,020
would feel, what would happen.

239
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,240
And I'm gonna go through
some specific examples here.

240
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,000
I just wanna set the stage that

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,800
if you're not doing a
thorough risk identification

242
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
before you do some analysis,
you might learn some things.

243
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,180
Okay, so this notion of the risk ecosystem

244
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,680
I do believe we should
take an ecosystem view

245
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,060
because many things in our environments

246
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,199
and our external environments
are connected, right?

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,290
So the risk ecosystem, I'm gonna talk

248
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,660
start at the top left here

249
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,180
on the vulnerability management process.

250
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,810
And generally speaking,
and I am generalizing

251
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,619
'cause I know there's a
broad and wide audience

252
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,610
for this talk.

253
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,040
But generally it's around
day-to-day patching,

254
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,030
release management, issue
management, problem management.

255
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,350
You know, there's a lot of
different things it's called,

256
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,040
but it's about making sure it's an input

257
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,980
to the risk management process.

258
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,680
It is a process on its own

259
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,050
and you do need to manage your
vulnerability process well,

260
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,319
however, it also should feed the risk

261
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
or issue management process.

262
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,670
Same thing with threat hunting.

263
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,329
When you think of threat
hunting, threat modeling,

264
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,600
if you're a cyber threat intel analyst,

265
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,880
you know, many of the activities
that you do are inputs

266
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,230
to the risk analysis or the
risk management process, right?

267
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,730
And understanding the specific
threats are more valuable

268
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,750
if you have a process for
getting the information

269
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,330
to the people who can actually
do something about it, right?

270
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,780
So it's not sufficient
just to hunt for threats,

271
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,069
unless there's an intake process

272
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,550
by which those can be prioritized, sorted,

273
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,430
compared against other risks
and threats in the environment,

274
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,099
other vulnerabilities to
which you might be susceptible

275
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,310
and then decide a
prioritize course of action

276
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,099
because we know that we can't
fix everything all the time.

277
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,530
And then on the bottom right

278
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,850
we've got this notion of
controls management, right?

279
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,510
So putting all of these
things in the context

280
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,569
so they can be prioritized,
it's not just finding a gap

281
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,300
or finding a vulnerability
or finding a threat

282
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,370
and then going straight to the action.

283
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,150
It's actually using some kind of criteria

284
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,410
whether that's risk
appetite or risk tolerance

285
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,569
or using some kind of risk taxonomy

286
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,640
to make sure that you've done a thorough

287
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,760
and complete identification
of all the things

288
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,280
that you're susceptible to.

289
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
And looking at these things

290
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,540
in the context of the
business and mission.

291
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,780
And also there's this notion
of which of these things

292
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,050
are in our control, meaning
which of these we can plan,

293
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,849
do check at and take some action on,

294
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,100
and which of them are
outside of our control

295
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,080
and how can we build our
preparedness muscles, right?

296
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,480
To make sure that we can
do something about them

297
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,050
should they materialize as an incident

298
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,689
or a realized risk, okay?

299
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,260
So again, I'm gonna ask you

300
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,569
if you have any questions
about what I've just said

301
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,120
to please do put this in the chat window.

302
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,810
I know this is a lot to throw at you

303
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,229
and it's a lot of moving
parts, not just only focused.

304
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,520
So we've set the stage now for
risk being about uncertainty.

305
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,880
That's why this notion of
looking forward, emerging things,

306
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,350
things on the horizon

307
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,230
are all part of the risk equation, okay?

308
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,330
As our threat intel, as our
vulnerability management,

309
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,870
as our other things that we know.

310
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,720
Now we have a more complete
picture of the ecosystem.

311
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,540
I'd like to move to the
topic of resilience, okay?

312
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,650
And moving from risk to resilience

313
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,540
is about building your
capabilities and your muscle.

314
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,540
But let me start first by
describing what resilience is

315
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,310
and what it might mean and some analogies

316
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,113
to help you think about this.

317
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,500
So resilience is an emergent property.

318
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,500
And what that means is
you don't buy resilience.

319
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,290
Now, let me just stop here for a second

320
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,410
and I'm gonna come to
this in the next slide

321
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,969
but I just wanna say this here

322
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,853
because we haven't gotten to it yet

323
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,632
and you can't see my slides yet.

324
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,670
In the business continuity
and disaster recovery world,

325
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,290
the word resilience is often
a synonym or a substitute

326
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,819
or you know, a synonym
for business continuity

327
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,630
or disaster recovery.

328
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,370
When I say resilience, I
mean much more of preparatory

329
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,460
as well as after something has happened.

330
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
So I mean more like a slinky.

331
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,410
So this little diagram in the beginning

332
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,670
in the middle of my
picture here is a slinky.

333
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,370
And normally I have a slinky on my desk

334
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,120
to help me with risk but today I don't.

335
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,130
I do have a Magic 8-Ball

336
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,310
but I don't have a slinky today.

337
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,839
But what the slinky reminds me is that

338
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,910
we need to be flexible and be resilient.

339
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,350
So I don't mean resilience

340
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,460
in the business continuity
disaster recovery,

341
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,480
I'll say more about that in a minute.

342
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,270
But resilience is a property.

343
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,050
And we take our definition,
I take my definition

344
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,140
from the physical sciences world, right?

345
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,590
It's about ebbing and
flowing, bouncing back.

346
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,350
And it's about when you
think about building

347
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,460
your resilience muscles, right?

348
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,349
So building a resilience capability.

349
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,949
It's about what I said before,

350
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,390
understanding the connection
from the business,

351
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,900
strategy objectives,
what I wanna accomplish,

352
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,390
who I wanna serve.

353
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,810
What are the risks that could
keep me from doing that?

354
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,240
Keep me from meeting my strategy,

355
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,440
keep me from meeting my objectives.

356
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,349
And then how do I adapt?

357
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,119
Because sometimes the
risks that are realized

358
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,830
or the incidents that occur are uneven.

359
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,460
They're not either, or they're not binary.

360
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,330
There's different situations,
changing conditions,

361
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,480
different kinds of disruptions.

362
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,990
And so this notion of being resilient

363
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,870
means that you can be like a slinky

364
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,469
and be a little more adaptable, right?

365
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,380
And so what are some other ways.

366
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,310
The analogy that I like to use

367
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,700
for resilience is health, okay?

368
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,350
You don't go to the store
and buy a bottle of health.

369
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,470
You become healthy, health
emerges when you eat well,

370
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,260
sleep well, take care
of yourself, exercise,

371
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,050
get regular checkups.

372
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,320
In the cyber world or the risk world,

373
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,429
the cyber risk world moving
from risk to resilience

374
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,703
means you plan for something.

375
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,700
You can't plan for everything
so you have to be adaptable.

376
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,110
You make sure you check

377
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,850
and you don't just check
once a year or once a quarter

378
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,540
or once every so often, you
plan, you check, you do you act

379
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,200
in a repeat wash, rinse,
repeat over and over, right?

380
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,650
So you understand your
connection between your mission

381
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,120
and your services and the critical assets.

382
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,379
You understand, you know,

383
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,190
you've identified your critical suppliers.

384
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,830
You do a robust job of
identifying all the risks

385
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,530
that your or type of
organization might be subject to

386
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,680
and things that you
haven't even thought of.

387
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,470
You do some scenario
analysis and planning.

388
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,910
You do coordinated management of things.

389
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,550
So maybe your vulnerability
management is coordinated

390
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,399
with your incident response.

391
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,950
So for example, you do
some root cause analysis

392
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,123
on your incidents.

393
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,090
And you look at all the
root causes of the incidents

394
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,649
that have occurred over a period of time

395
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,920
and you say, which of those indicate

396
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,810
that we need a better
vulnerability management process,

397
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,770
a quicker vulnerability
management process.

398
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,639
And I'm using that because
it's a very concrete example

399
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
but many of the root causes of incidents

400
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,960
are caused from vulnerabilities
that have a solution, right?

401
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,150
So where do we wanna put our resources

402
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,570
instead of looking at threats.

403
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,800
And I think threats are important

404
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,090
but where do we wanna put our next dollar?

405
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,370
Is it to shore up something

406
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,652
that continues to happen over and over?

407
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,270
You wanna make sure that your management

408
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,260
and deployment of people is robust

409
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,530
and that you're putting them

410
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,879
on the highest priority
problems based on risk, right?

411
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,380
That's a resilience superpower.

412
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,930
Also management of external partners.

413
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,740
You know, do you have really
robust and good criteria

414
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,390
for understanding the
value that the partner

415
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,400
or a particular product provides

416
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,603
in the ultimate delivery
of your mission, okay?

417
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,583
Okay, so as I said before,

418
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:26,370
the traditional business
continuity and disaster recovery

419
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,010
is a very important part of resilience,

420
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,560
but it's not all of resilience.

421
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,820
What I'm talking about is operational

422
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,879
and organizational resilience.

423
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
It's really about that
multidisciplinary approach

424
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,480
where you prepare, well, let me back up.

425
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,250
Before you prepare, you
anticipate, anticipation is done

426
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,140
through the notion of

427
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,760
the anticipation is done through

428
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,560
good robust risk identification.

429
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,419
What scenarios would impact us and how?

430
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,900
Then you prepare for those

431
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,010
knowing that you can't
prepare for everything,

432
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,940
then you adapt if something
happens or changes,

433
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,030
and then you withstand,

434
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,530
recover and get back to business as usual

435
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,290
as much as possible, okay?

436
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,430
So in this diagram, which you've
seen before on the bottom,

437
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,690
I changed those risk management processes

438
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,110
to resilience management.

439
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,639
It's like a continuum,

440
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
the better you get at risk management,

441
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,013
the more resilience
muscle you actually build.

442
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,490
Okay, so now that I've
got that out of the way,

443
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,850
I'm gonna give you an example

444
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,622
of the resilience ecosystem landscape.

445
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:40,370
This is from a top down view
rather than a left to right.

446
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,750
So on the top are threat to
exposures events conditions,

447
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,580
in the middle are your products
and services and assets,

448
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,870
on the bottom of your business,

449
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,350
are resilience processes, okay?

450
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,090
And in this particular example,

451
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,473
you see in the lighter colored box,

452
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,200
the cyber attack in this
case renders the technology

453
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,540
and information assets unavailable.

454
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,840
You may not know the reason
why, maybe it's ransomware.

455
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,379
In this case, it might
be terrorism or crime

456
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,580
might be the motive, but
you don't know that yet.

457
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,370
But all of a sudden you need
to take a holistic approach

458
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,449
for your business continuity,
disaster recovery,

459
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,020
knowledge and information management,

460
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,190
situational awareness,
incident management.

461
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,963
So your resilience processes
have to be unified, okay?

462
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,330
All right, so I'm gonna say any questions.

463
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,699
I know that was a lot,
but any questions here?

464
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,730
So let's talk about

465
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,110
building a resilience
superpower capability, okay?

466
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,310
So when faced with many of
these dynamic challenges,

467
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,080
the most successful cybersecurity programs

468
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,420
engage a diverse and holistic approach.

469
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,830
So, you know, there's a
clear lack of diversity

470
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,300
in its forms within the
cybersecurity profession,

471
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,940
both racial, gender, thought leadership,

472
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,600
all kinds of reasons,

473
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,990
but we need to engage
multidisciplinary teams.

474
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,210
And earlier this year,

475
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,620
I.S.C2 formed its first
global diversity equity

476
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,989
and inclusion task force to support that,

477
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,203
to advance meaningful
progress in this space.

478
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,693
So let's talk about why
that's really important.

479
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,100
Who are cybersecurity professionals today?

480
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,629
Well, they're largely millennials

481
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,517
which means they're between
mid 20's to mid 40's

482
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:31,453
and 72% of them are male, okay?

483
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,189
So in the United States, now remember

484
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,600
there are several research papers

485
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,310
that I.S.C2 has done in this space.

486
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,090
In the United States, and it
is a little bit U.S centric

487
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,720
although we're expanding
our research globally,

488
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,860
cyber racial diversity is closer to parody

489
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,399
than gender diversity, okay?

490
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,970
And this is a big deal because
this notion of inclusion,

491
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,470
we need to make sure that we
include different thoughts,

492
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,443
different viewpoints, different,

493
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,870
you know, just really a multicultural

494
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,520
and also multi-disciplinary
approach, okay?

495
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,893
So it's not just gender and
racial but it's also education.

496
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,740
In the U.S, in most occupations

497
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,530
about half of the workforce is female.

498
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:27,530
But in the U.S, only one in
four computer occupations

499
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,970
are held by women and only
one in five of those in cyber

500
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,543
are held by women.

501
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,770
So let's talk about the gap in
cybersecurity as a workforce.

502
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,910
Globally, it's 3.12 million
people that we should

503
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,180
and could and can hire as
we grow to build our muscles

504
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,660
in risk and resilience.

505
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,660
You know, Asia Pacific probably
has the largest gap, okay?

506
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,760
But in the United States and
I'm sorry, in North America,

507
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,760
we have nearly 400,000
open unfilled roles, okay?

508
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:13,598
So let's talk about the top
10 technical hero skills

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,060
and then I'm gonna give you
some additional superpowers

510
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,970
that have nothing or little
to do with technology.

511
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,600
So, first one, Cloud security.

512
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,169
You know, we know a lot about you know,

513
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,950
Cloud is a hot topic right now

514
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,640
because people are looking
for concentrated expertise.

515
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,600
Many of you may have heard
the saying a few years back

516
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,060
from Wendy Nader on
the cyber poverty line.

517
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,690
Organizations that are smaller

518
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,800
or don't have resources
to do some of the things

519
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,830
that I've described to
build their superpower,

520
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,270
their resilience muscle might
want to look at Cloud, okay?

521
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,050
Some others are data analysis, right?

522
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,350
Malware analysis, coding, and programming.

523
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,773
These are all still important skills.

524
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,360
Intrusion detection, access management,

525
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,120
administration, control design.

526
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,129
Okay, one of the underserved markets

527
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,940
I think is risk analysis, risk assessment,

528
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,540
risk management, risk identification.

529
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,780
And that's the number one sort
of both on the technical list

530
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,440
and the non-technical list

531
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,210
that people say is needed in this field.

532
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,890
And risk management, cyber risk especially

533
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,260
requires a multidisciplinary approach.

534
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,193
But let's talk about the
non-technical superpowers, right?

535
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,133
What I call the secret
resilience superpowers.

536
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,460
Okay, so analytical
thinking, critical thinking,

537
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,750
problem solving, you know,
this notion of creativity.

538
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,670
These are all things that it takes

539
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,733
to solve these thorny
problems that we have, okay?

540
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,340
The ideal model, this is a graphic

541
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,330
about how to solve problems.

542
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,070
There actually really is an
I.D.E.A.L model I-D-E-A-L

543
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,973
if you look it up.

544
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,179
Identify the problem, define the problem,

545
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,640
explore the problem, action the problem.

546
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
They use look back in this graphic.

547
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,030
I actually prefer learn.

548
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,030
I think we should fail
first, learn something

549
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,050
and move on to the next thing, okay?

550
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,320
And then, you know,
ability to work on a team.

551
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,870
This is not a solo, this is a team sport.

552
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,209
There's one more to
this list that I'll add.

553
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,920
And for those especially in the millennial

554
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,640
or younger cohort, and that is
sleep, you need to make sure

555
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,740
that you get plenty of sleep
as an emergent property

556
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,163
of taking care of your
health to be more resilient.

557
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,030
Okay, so tips for recruiting
and retaining diverse teams.

558
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,850
Consider upskilling or reskilling staff

559
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,360
that works in your organization.

560
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,310
Hire for attitude and aptitude.

561
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,169
I personally believe
that security principles

562
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,940
and engineering principles
and a lot of these skills

563
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,160
can be taught if you hire people

564
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,100
that wanna be on the team, right?

565
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,159
Invest in training, make
sure that people understand.

566
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,720
Assign a buddy or a mentor.

567
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,850
And I'll cover a few of these in depth,

568
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,610
but you know, professionals
are more successful

569
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,760
if they have a mentor or
people they can talk with

570
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,293
about problems in the space, right?

571
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,879
You know, recognition builds confidence.

572
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,480
When I said fail first,

573
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,070
what I mean is give somebody a hypothesis,

574
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,429
give a team a challenge problem.

575
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,260
I mean, we do this when we have off sites,

576
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,160
you know, one of the ones, my son is also

577
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,060
when he was in robotics and
in school, in elementary

578
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,030
and middle school, they have challenges,

579
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,710
you know the spaghetti
marshmallow challenge

580
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,010
where you have to build a tall structure

581
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,570
using only spaghetti, uncooked
spaghetti and marshmallows

582
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,409
and maybe some scotch tape.

583
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,440
You know, let's start small

584
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,770
and tackle some of the big problems

585
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,379
by learning how to fail quickly, fail fast

586
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,160
and learn from that
using the I.D.E.A.L model

587
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,993
and then keep on going, right?

588
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,663
Okay.

589
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,909
Professional development.

590
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,430
You know professional development

591
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,540
isn't just training and certifications.

592
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,820
And I know that seems odd

593
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,500
from a person who sits
on the I.S.C2 Board.

594
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,990
I believe in certifications,

595
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,330
I have my own and I maintain them

596
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,899
and I pay out of my own pocket
every year to maintain them

597
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,330
and get the continuing
education that's needed.

598
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,590
Because I believe

599
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,570
that it's important to
continue to develop yourself.

600
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,300
But one of the strategies
that employers could use

601
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,770
is to entice people with
professional development, right?

602
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,950
Make sure you're addressing their needs.

603
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,010
Make sure you don't keep them in a role

604
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,680
if they want to do something else

605
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,810
that you rotate people around

606
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,409
so that you can create a different lens

607
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,320
that people are looking
through and looking at

608
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,423
when they're facing
these challenges, right?

609
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,840
Okay, next one is,

610
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,169
okay, stop waiting for unicorns.

611
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,060
I know, I know.

612
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,450
But wait, I gotta show you this

613
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,420
because this is my favorite right here.

614
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,360
I happen to like unicorns.

615
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,639
However, I will say to you,
stop looking for unicorns.

616
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,050
Hire for attitude, hire for aptitude.

617
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,159
You know, there are many
myths in cybersecurity.

618
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,130
One of those is that you have
to have a four year degree.

619
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,520
That is a myth, okay?

620
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,520
It's just not true, but often
it's a barrier to entry, okay?

621
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,393
Some of the job descriptions,
you know, are not realistic.

622
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,250
You need to look past sort of titles

623
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,340
and hire for attitude
and hire for aptitude.

624
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,740
Broaden the net.

625
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,120
Look for people who are in other fields,

626
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,689
teachers, veterans

627
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,880
who are transitioning to
the civilian community,

628
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
liberal arts grads.

629
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,680
There are so many other communities

630
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,830
that could bring something to
the traditionally millennial,

631
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,530
you know, male dominated field.

632
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,670
Also, if you know,

633
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,130
many qualified recruits
have digital experience.

634
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,370
And the reason I say this is
think about electronic music

635
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,689
or digital music.

636
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,050
You know, many of the people

637
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:14,050
in many of the creative arts
now are using digital tools

638
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,280
and digital software, and
they have a lot of skills

639
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,562
that could also be used
in this field, right?

640
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,210
Okay, add creativity to recruiting.

641
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,590
Yes, by all means go after
recent grads, go after people.

642
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,379
But look at people who are
consultants or contractors.

643
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,380
You know, I like the gig economy

644
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,280
because I like sort of being
able to purchase and buy.

645
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,090
I've also worked in the gig economy

646
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:49,179
and I like being able to have
the schedule flexibility.

647
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,670
So if someone's a
consultant or a contractor

648
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,463
and doesn't wanna work full time,

649
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,139
it doesn't mean you can't
use their skills, right?

650
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,480
Other departments within
your organization,

651
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,543
other companies in the same industry,

652
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,210
same skills different industry, right?

653
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,050
Hardware, security vendors,
and career changers.

654
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,730
You know, many people,
especially over the last year

655
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,530
have taken stock in their
own careers, their own lives,

656
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,139
and decided they wanna
do something differently.

657
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,790
So give them a chance if
they have the right attitude

658
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,399
and the right aptitude and
they're willing to learn,

659
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,670
invest in them, right?

660
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,500
And if 2020 has shown us anything,

661
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,900
it's that the talent pool

662
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,770
can virtually work from anywhere, right?

663
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,110
There are some jobs that
do require in person,

664
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,610
but this widens the net for you.

665
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,570
You no longer have to
look in your backyard,

666
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,862
you can actually look broader than that.

667
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,520
All right, so I'm at my last
slide, next to the last slide,

668
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,460
which is, you know,

669
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,530
let's talk about what you
could do next week, next month

670
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,270
and in three months.

671
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,550
If you have critical open
positions in your organization,

672
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,700
can you collaborate
with the hiring manager

673
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,890
especially if you know, a
little bit about the job,

674
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,393
especially if you know a
little bit about, you know,

675
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,070
what the requirements are
that may not be obvious

676
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,230
from reading the job description.

677
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,730
Put the word out on social media,

678
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,110
put the word out to people
who you want to work with

679
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,810
who are in your network.

680
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,520
Volunteer to be a mentor to
a new person in cybersecurity

681
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,160
if they're not from a traditional
cybersecurity background.

682
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,200
And also seek out a
mentor yourself, you know,

683
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,260
I have three mentees at the moment,

684
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,379
but I also get mentoring myself

685
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,250
even at the stage of my career

686
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,680
because I think it's so important

687
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,040
to continuously bring a new
and fresh perspective to cyber.

688
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,540
Next month, maybe you could offer

689
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,320
to test your speaking skills
by arranging a lunch and learn

690
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,929
in discussing or collaborating,
or start a book club,

691
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,030
you know, and read some of the old sort of

692
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,890
what do we call them, the
classics of cybersecurity, right?

693
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,550
And take an inventory of your own skills

694
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,029
and look where you
might add some new ones.

695
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,600
And then in three months
you could research,

696
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,540
enroll perhaps in a certificate
or a technical program,

697
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,009
or just take some classes

698
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,510
that will broaden your own perspective

699
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,350
especially if you've been in
the field of cybersecurity

700
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,712
for a really long time.

701
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,379
Okay, so I know you've asked
questions along the way

702
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,469
and I appreciate that

703
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,310
and you can ask some more
questions now, should you wish to.

704
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,100
My LinkedIn profile is here.

710
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,530
that building your muscles
in risk and resilience

711
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,300
is the way to develop superpowers.

712
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,450
So thank you very much.
