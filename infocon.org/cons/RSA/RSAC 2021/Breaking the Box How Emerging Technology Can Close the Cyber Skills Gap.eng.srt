1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,939
- Hello, and welcome to this
session on breaking the box

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,220
how emerging technology
can close the cybersecurity

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,550
skills gap.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,910
My name is Diana Kelley and
I am the CTO and co-founder

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,190
at Securitycurve.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,127
And joining me today to
present this topic is..

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,009
- Deveeshree Nayak.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,420
And my name is, you know,
people call me Deveeshree.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,930
I'm an assistant teaching professor

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,750
at the university of Washington Tacoma

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,820
and I teach ID and cybersecurity courses.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,480
And it's an honor to join here.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,559
And, you know, speaking about this topic

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,580
which I'm passionate about

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,030
- Yeah, we're both really excited

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,160
to be able to present this.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,559
This is so we know that
the, the session is recorded

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,560
but we are also here live
with you in the chat.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,770
So if you have questions

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,550
as you're listening to this presentation,

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,163
please we can interact
with you in the chat so

22
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:59,839
that you can have a more sort
of that experience of being

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,433
with us as though we were all
together in person at RSA.

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,500
So our agenda, we're going to
just go over this real quick.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,150
We're going to discuss
the different aspects

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,610
of why there are issues

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,400
with hiring right now and with
getting a better talent pool.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,110
And then we're going to use the model

29
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,820
of explaining what the problem is

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,649
and then talking about box breaking.

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,810
So first talk a little
bit about the problem.

32
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,160
You know, things like
scholarships, reskilling

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,970
and then we'll do the box breaking.

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,020
This is the slide that falls.

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,729
We'll talk about how
emerging technology can help.

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,560
So to get us started, we're
going to talk about the big one

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,290
which is the cybersecurity skills gap.

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,510
You hear so much about this in
the news, the headlines news.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,820
Sometimes I talk to people

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,289
that want to get into cybersecurity.

41
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,470
I'm sure you do this a lot Deveeshree

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,438
you know, a lot of people
are like how do I get in?

43
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,290
And when you ask them

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,150
why do you want to be in cyber security?

45
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,800
It's often because of
this skills gap, you know

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,970
the headlines are that
there's no unemployment.

47
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,380
And I think in a lot of
people's minds that feels like,

48
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,460
Oh there's no unemployment.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,720
I'll never be without a job.

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,550
And I'm going to get out of school

51
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,590
and people are going to
offer me these incredible

52
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,860
well-paying jobs that are
doing really cool things

53
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
in cybersecurity.

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,399
And while it is true that
there is a skills gap

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,073
and then it can be very hard
if you're a hiring manager

56
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:21,330
in cyber to find the right talent.

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,020
It's also not the truth

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,330
that everybody who graduates
instantly the next day

59
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,170
has this incredible six-figure
job of their dreams.

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,149
The reality is that
some people do graduate

61
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,780
with degrees or are
maybe going from one job

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,090
looking for the next and
it can be a little bit

63
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,440
challenging to find that next job.

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,350
And here's an example
from a user at Reddit

65
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
talking about, you know, they've gotten

66
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,489
they have a master's in cybersecurity

67
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,340
they've got this very
respected security certificate

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
from compTIA Security Plus

69
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,780
but it's still having
trouble finding jobs.

70
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,720
So this does, this is a reality.

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,410
It does happen.

72
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,243
Why?

73
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,829
Though, What is the disconnect?

74
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,810
Well, part of that is really that

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,200
in cybersecurity because we're
a fairly nascent practice.

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,519
And I know that it's
cybersecurity been around for,

77
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,353
for decades.

78
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,290
I've been practicing for decades but

79
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,600
if you compare cybersecurity
to say accounting

80
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,250
or to consulting at the big
four, I just made a same bridge

81
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,870
accounting and consulting,
or, you know, being a doctor

82
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,310
or a lawyer there, the career
paths are a little bit clearer

83
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,580
because these practices have been around

84
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,260
for a longer amount of
time and cybersecurity

85
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,406
it may be confusing if you
started out as an analyst

86
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:40,110
and in a SOC or in a operation center,

87
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,493
where do you go from there?

88
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,490
A CSO where everybody
wants to go for example

89
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,560
and Jon Oltsik did a really
good assessment of this

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,980
in the life and times of
cybersecurity professionals.

91
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,910
This report that he put
out, taking a look at

92
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,680
what is it like to be in
the world of cybersecurity

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,980
and what is our career path?

94
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,299
Another issue that can
be really hard as people

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,040
are trying to either get that first job,

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,030
or as they're growing in their career

97
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,700
is just general confusion
at companies about cyber.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,119
What does cyber mean?

99
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,470
Where does the CSO sit?

100
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,810
Are they actually, they've
got a C title, but as they're

101
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,230
in the C-suite or are
they a director that just

102
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,170
gets the C title?

103
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,079
Cause everybody talks CSO,
you know, what's the important

104
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,010
importance of cyber?

105
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,610
Have we graduated from
being the doctor knows

106
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,260
of the world back when
I started practicing,

107
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,940
it felt like we were
always just saying, no,

108
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,773
you can't do that.

109
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,800
That's not a good idea.

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,930
So it felt like security was
kind of holding the business

111
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,180
back instead of moving
the business forward.

112
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,410
So that's some of the disconnects,

113
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,000
and I know that certifications is one

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,140
that's really important to you
Devee so I'm gonna hand off.

115
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,400
- So certifications and
education because I'm, you know

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,299
teaching

117
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,490
in

118
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,940
cybersecurity.

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,230
I think that it's a kind of a
intersection of certifications

120
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,210
and education and hands-on,
and it's, it's also, it's very

121
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,950
very important that we
should not be considering

122
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,570
in one bucket and like a stack it's like

123
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,580
this is the only part for cybersecurity.

124
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,090
Like, you know, if you
are like doing hands-on

125
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,770
then only hands-on is going
to be, if you are like

126
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,789
you know, going in a
certification path, you know

127
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,010
in high school or after high
school, then it will be one.

128
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,280
So like, it's, it's a very
much like intersection of like

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,409
you know, you do you, and
you can choose your own part

130
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,330
in cybersecurity and you do
have a good understanding.

131
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,560
And then that is also like, you know

132
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,350
we are trying to push diverse
security and inclusion

133
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,540
which is very, very important

134
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,280
because when we have a diverse
set of teams, the approaches

135
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,780
when we come, it's very different.

136
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,429
Like if a person is
coming from criminology

137
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,580
if a person is coming from education

138
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,320
same with different
speaking, different languages

139
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,790
understanding of culture,

140
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,330
it's a very very important
that we stress on those things.

141
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,219
Not only like in one set of mindset

142
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,430
rather than very diverse group of ideas

143
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,770
that diverse representation.

144
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,690
And then moving on when we talk about

145
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,190
power of starting early,
it's more about like,

146
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,840
you know, curiosity into
good year especially like,

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,000
you know, pushing our our
young generation to participate

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,760
in cybersecurity that
actually raise the bar.

149
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,840
And they are very much curious

150
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,780
and make them aware of like, you know

151
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,039
why cybersecurity is
important the way we actually

152
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,510
teach them why security is important.

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,480
when we teach a child that
don't speak to the unknown.

154
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,960
So the, the way nowadays that now we are

155
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,200
in a virtual world and we are
connected in the virtual world

156
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,710
and we are taking education
in a virtual world.

157
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,560
I think that like pursuing the curiosity

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,650
in starting from K five,
it's very, very important

159
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,310
giving that confidence and
at least doing workshops

160
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,950
and like, you know, developing
the play activities,

161
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,180
Legos, building that confidence
is very, very important.

162
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,900
And, you know, the scientific exploration.

163
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,770
And

164
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,979
like, I think that like, you know

165
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,790
with lifetime scientific
exploration, Diana

166
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,310
you have explored a lot.

167
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,483
And I would love if you

168
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,210
take it from here

169
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,217
share your experience a little
bit, like how you have done

170
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:20,140
you know, lifetime experience with this.

171
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,469
- Yeah and I think that this
is really where the, you know

172
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,370
the box starts getting
broken is that sometimes

173
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,560
you know, we, we think a few things

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,560
we think that maybe children
aren't going to be engineers

175
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,960
or they, you know, they're
not as interested in, in math.

176
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,640
Or there maybe gender
decisions on, well, you know

177
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,490
this is gender likes technology

178
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,650
and mathematics and this gender doesn't.

179
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,900
And you know, let's
break out of the box and

180
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,310
and start very early about
the, as you talked about

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,556
you know, things like Legos
that begins to, you know

182
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,530
a lot of the engineers were started

183
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,590
out with the Lego, the Lego building.

184
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,049
So getting into this very
early approach to ensure

185
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,610
that people get the love
of the technology early

186
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,230
especially because when
children are younger

187
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,630
the neuroplasticity is so
much greater than if we, if we

188
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,920
if we lock in this belief
with children very early

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,750
that they can't do one thing or another

190
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,450
they're going to grow
up conditioned to think

191
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,340
that in our brains kind
of just like set that way.

192
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,640
Whereas when children
see it as play and fun

193
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,640
and that everybody is capable
of doing something in science

194
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,950
in technology, and you get
that and you ignite that

195
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,309
then you start to really break
out of this box of, you know

196
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,289
certain kinds of people
can't do technology and

197
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,459
and people know children
unfortunately grow up to

198
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,610
be adults that believe some of
these stories that they hear.

199
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,270
So using the using tools like, you know

200
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,819
being able to build these systems

201
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,310
and create more play in
school can really help.

202
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,800
And there's a lot of technology
that can help with that.

203
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,670
Not just so it's, it's a social
and it's a program problem

204
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,990
but also technology can help
us with some of these tools.

205
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,930
You know, for example

206
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,260
there's this great little
thing called bedtime math

207
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,900
which is for very young
children, as early as three

208
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,220
helping them to start have fun with math.

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,570
So even your very young with
your, with your children

210
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,340
you can end with schools
can encourage this to

211
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,200
really get to, to get
that fun with technology.

212
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,410
And there are a lot of
now different programs for

213
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,260
for women specifically, you know, things

214
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,220
like girls who code to really
get that engagement early on

215
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,100
and using technology and using this place.

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,530
So instead of just having
kids with their iPads

217
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,100
kind of batting around at
things and playing games

218
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,170
they complete games that
ignite this real passion

219
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,530
for technology.

220
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,400
Are there any that are some
of your favorite Devee?

221
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,829
- Yes. That's actually a great

222
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,830
like CS for all Khan Academy code.org.

223
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,120
Those are the websites.

224
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,640
Like whenever I actually, you know

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
do workshops with middle
schoolers, high schoolers

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
I gave them that like, you know

227
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,210
this is one of the takeaways
you can, you know, pursue

228
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,920
which actually help you grow

229
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,170
because code.org it's
actually teaches you more

230
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,400
like how to building
blocks and create a music.

231
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,430
And then, you know

232
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,979
being creative and that
enhances creativity.

233
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,690
And then, you know, Chick Tech,
I'm, I'm a volunteer myself

234
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,550
in Chick Tech as well,
but we conduct workshops

235
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,189
which a little bit older, like, you know

236
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,920
who are going to be more

237
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,400
in high school and professionals
where like, you know, the

238
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,270
the hunger of technology and how to use it

239
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,550
and how to make it a
profession out of them.

240
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,140
And then like, you know

241
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,150
going a little bit more deeper about

242
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,740
like data structure and I'll
go to them more like, you know

243
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,660
there is always a lack of saying that, Oh

244
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,770
math is hard or computer
science is harder.

245
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,819
Coding is hard, but it
is the regular process

246
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,920
repeated the process we do every day.

247
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,280
I think that that's kind
of, when they see this type

248
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,160
of Khan Academy and code.org
and several resources

249
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,790
they are able to build their
confidence by themselves

250
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,699
and this, with the support
of other people as well.

251
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,930
And then there is other
resources as well, based

252
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,370
on experience and what the
background they're coming from.

253
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,910
And if we can, like, you
know, in our upcoming slides

254
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,973
we will be more discussing on that.

255
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,989
- Yeah. And it's, it's just amazing when

256
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,440
children grow up and doing something

257
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,690
they don't question whether
they're capable of it or not.

258
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,700
It just becomes so much something that

259
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,270
that they own in themselves.

260
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,030
So getting that again, as being early

261
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,020
with training and using some

262
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,760
of these great new tools
that are available to

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,970
help engage people is I
think really gonna change

264
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,013
the cybersecurity skills gap overall.

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,390
So, okay.

266
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,170
What else, what else can be done?

267
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,729
So some other things that
the students are concerned

268
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,560
about and looking at
things like scholarships,

269
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,150
internships and externships

270
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,699
and where the real issue
comes is those students

271
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,290
that are graduating with
these master's degrees

272
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,030
and with, you know, with
these great certifications

273
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,850
but they might not have is experience.

274
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,180
And that really creates
this chicken or egg problem.

275
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,609
And I don't know if you've seen some

276
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,780
of those memes lately that
have been going around

277
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,980
on LinkedIn, but people are
getting really frustrated.

278
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,840
You know, they're seeing advertisements

279
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,710
for entry-level jobs
because somebody, you know

280
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,210
we're hiring somebody fresh out of school.

281
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,370
Here's an entry level job

282
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,040
but we want five years of experience.

283
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,110
It's like, wait, what,
how does it work that way?

284
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,670
How did you just get out of school?

285
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,410
And you have five years of experience.

286
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,630
So there's this real
chicken or egg problem

287
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,490
of people desperate to,
they want experience

288
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,880
but they just don't, they
can't get those first jobs.

289
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,040
So one of the things that can
be really really helpful here

290
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,250
is to explore things like
internships and externships.

291
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,800
So an internship you may,
you may be paid or unpaid.

292
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,969
Externships could be something that you do

293
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,260
while you still in school.

294
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,189
So that you're, you, you may
take a semester that you go out

295
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,730
and you do an externship from that school

296
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,250
with a company, a local company.

297
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,740
And then now you've got some
experience where you can

298
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,960
if your school doesn't
offer something like that

299
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,570
you can look into internship programs.

300
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,670
Now some of them are
paid and that's great.

301
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,410
So, you know, don't just say,

302
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,727
I can't afford to do
an internship look at,

303
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,090
and some externships are paid too.

304
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,710
So if you need to get paid
and a lot of people are paying

305
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,310
for school and going into debt with that

306
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,180
then of course you would
want to focus on the more the

307
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,459
the paid kinds of programs

308
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,810
but also unpaid can be very helpful.

309
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,709
And if you're not a job
seeker, but you're a job hire

310
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,160
and you're looking at how maybe you

311
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,350
and your organization can
start doing a little bit

312
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,160
more box breaking and help close this gap

313
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,420
start getting creative about
what you may be able to put

314
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,260
into an intern or externship.

315
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,890
Think about the processes

316
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,160
at your organization, how they run.

317
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,130
And if there's any component of that,

318
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,689
that could be broken off
to give to a student,

319
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,140
to give them some experience

320
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,180
so that they don't have to
graduate with no experience.

321
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,810
And then there are scholarships

322
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,219
fine are very close to your heart.

323
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,090
- So the, the scholarship and I, I really

324
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,230
agree with you when we talk about

325
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,740
internships and externships.

326
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,620
And then I tell to my
students always that, you know

327
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,500
having an internship is
very, very important.

328
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,950
And if you can find any
and helping to anybody

329
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,349
in your school, in your
community, in your local group

330
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,790
I know spiritual group you
are part of or anything.

331
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,780
If you can help like local businesses

332
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,117
in that can be an internships
and have getting paid

333
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,970
or speak about it, raising
awareness about cybersecurity.

334
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,210
So it can be anything experience counted

335
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,740
towards your dedication.

336
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,051
And then the scholarship
and the scholarship is

337
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,420
that there are different
types of scholarship.

338
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,040
When we talk about one of
the few great scholarship

339
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,180
is one of cyber cop a
scholarship for service,

340
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,099
and it's actually helping you like it's a

341
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,890
two to three years of scholarship.

342
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,870
You can apply in bachelor's
or master's and PhD programs

343
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,631
where actually when you, the

344
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:19,410
the United States government
will pay for your education

345
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,540
and your stipend, and you'll
get a professional development.

346
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,550
Also like after you finish
that, you know, for undergrad

347
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,093
you get almost like 25 grand
and for graduate is 34K.

348
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,396
And then once you graduate,
you will able to get like

349
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:36,920
you know, a federal government state local

350
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,800
and in your County level
as well for your service

351
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,180
what you have been offered.

352
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,500
And that's a great scholarship

353
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,940
for people who would
like to explore a career

354
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,580
in cyber security and, you know

355
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,240
it will be paid for your school as well.

356
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,560
And it will also help you
to get the certification

357
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,670
and experience and the
internships where you are looking

358
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,890
for it is a great package and
always tell people to look

359
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,390
for one of the great scholarship program.

360
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,620
And the association is we say which Dinah.

361
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,710
And we both are part of
women in cybersecurity

362
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,160
which also offers not only
to students, women, veterans

363
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,920
you know, we all person of
color, very much encouragement.

364
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,410
I am actually part of that group

365
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,480
since 2014 when I was a grad school.

366
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,060
And then there are
other scholarships, like

367
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,030
as we mentioned, that center
of cyber safety and education,

368
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,870
that is women's scholarship.

369
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,293
That is veterans scholarship.

370
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:35,457
That is also like when we talk about like

371
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:38,790
more scholarship for
undergraduate and graduate.

372
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,060
So there are opportunities.

373
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,020
And then, you know, college
board scholarship search

374
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,420
there are many, you
know, box like, you know

375
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,709
when we're trying to break this box

376
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,470
that how opportunities
are we need to look for

377
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,190
we need to ask questions.

378
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,020
And we also, like, if you
see that is a big push of

379
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,949
you know, diversity inclusion

380
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,750
and also like different, different
sections of cybersecurity

381
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,530
not only in general, like
there is spent testing

382
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,260
there is policy and there is chronology

383
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,839
and there is, you know,
IT operations, so many.

384
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,459
So that's, that's what we
are trying to like, you know

385
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,020
kind of trying to build the generation gap

386
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,490
and skill gap when we talk
about, and, you know, continuing

387
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,390
we will be talking about like how will be

388
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,410
like the scholarship and other educations.

389
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,806
And they, you know,
interdisciplinary education will help

390
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:35,710
in our career exploration
in cybersecurity.

391
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,180
- Yeah absolutely and it's,
so it's so important yet

392
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,160
the interdisciplinary work of cyber is

393
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,670
is now expanding cause it's
such a big, important part of

394
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,060
of our world now.

395
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,192
And then also one thing
that was interesting is

396
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:53,130
Forage is looking at virtual
work experience program.

397
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,000
So it's not just for
COVID where everybody was

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
getting virtual work experience

399
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,670
but also that's something
that can help too

400
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,990
if you can't go to

401
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,430
I had mentioned, you know,
local companies, right?

402
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,120
The nice thing about it, you know

403
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,419
courts like Forage are starting to look at

404
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,570
how we can give people experience

405
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,490
even if they don't
happen to be right there

406
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,143
so that they can do it remotely.

407
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,370
We had talked about some of
these skills and, and that

408
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,100
that cyber is really,
sometimes people think

409
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,356
about you're in the basement and you're

410
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:28,070
or in a data center and your head's down.

411
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,439
And you're just writing
code all the time, which is

412
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,710
you know what, that's actually

413
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,530
I know a lot of practitioners who do that

414
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,391
they're threat hunters,
they're reverse engineers,

415
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:38,470
they love it.

416
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,520
And that's great.

417
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,370
And that's a wonderful, that
is one thing that you can do

418
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,750
if you're, if you're very
introverted, for example

419
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,240
and you really do just like being

420
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,250
between you and the
keyboard and the code that's

421
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,700
there are roles for you in
cyber, but they're also a lot

422
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,870
of skills that really enhance
what you can do in cyber

423
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,162
and different kinds of careers
that people can can take on.

424
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,680
- And when we talk about
this type of career take-on

425
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,380
will you also talk about not only

426
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,810
like coders that also like
people who are investigators

427
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,210
people who are more learning
about cybersecurity analysis

428
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,546
and having an interdisciplinary approach

429
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:22,620
helping to catch cyber
criminals who are trying to like

430
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,860
you know, abuse their
power or their talent in a

431
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,389
in a very different ways.

432
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,110
And, you know, online crime
has been grown since, you know

433
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,600
we all switched to virtual if we compare

434
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,169
and if you see different websites, like

435
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,670
you know, there is, you
know, Interpol website

436
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,330
that how crime has impacted
when we become virtual

437
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,970
and how the schools and middle schools

438
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,520
high schools are targeted

439
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,650
being targeted all across the globe.

440
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,730
The data is very overwhelming.

441
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,830
And when we talk about like more

442
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,820
you know, interdisciplinary,
so cybersecurity

443
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,120
as I mentioned from the beginning

444
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,010
that it is very much diverse.

445
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,160
It's not only like I
think that that used to

446
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,990
be a stereotype that only
computer scientists can go

447
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,130
and pursue cybersecurity,
but that's actually it,

448
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,410
it is a myth because there
are diverse backgrounds

449
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,920
for example, criminology and
criminology, criminal justice

450
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,350
and sociology psychology, you
can study about the crime.

451
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,719
And like those theories
are very older periods.

452
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,960
Now being implemented in cyber security

453
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,490
then we're talking about
engineering when engineering cyber

454
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,030
physical system infrastructure
has been targeted

455
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,070
smart grid, we talk about
and then how we will

456
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,670
give a safer environment.

457
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,360
When we talk about like
criminology, it used to be a myth

458
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,560
that we only folks talk
about, like, you know

459
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
general security.

460
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,073
Well, the security is
physical security is very

461
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:53,110
very important because the
data centers we talk about

462
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,270
the data's are stored.

463
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,810
It's in a physical place.

464
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,100
The computers are stored
in a physical place.

465
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,273
So that's like very, very
important that we also combine

466
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:05,270
in our studies that how it is important to

467
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,730
have interdisciplinary
approach of thinking.

468
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,100
And then when we talk about
like physical security

469
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,770
of cameras that I positioning the, the

470
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,610
the angles and the bolts
of like you know now

471
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,219
highly

472
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,900
magnifying cameras where
we can literally focus

473
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,270
on particular and find out who are the

474
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,540
that they're helping in very much

475
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,550
cyber investigation mathematics
and using mathematics to

476
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,159
enhance cryptographic
algorithm encryptions

477
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,410
and which will help to gum
more navigation like, you know

478
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,380
when in network, more defensive mechanism.

479
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,300
So it's, it's not, it's,
it's a very, very diverse

480
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
you can be a major music background

481
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,736
it can be a psychology background.

482
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,550
You can pursue cybersecurity.

483
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,840
So don't get disappointed

484
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,290
that you are pursuing
your passion and not.

485
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,320
So if you are a pursuing any major

486
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,750
you do have a place in cybersecurity.

487
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,273
- Yeah and hiring managers to, you know

488
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:05,072
I think about, you know, if
you are looking at right now

489
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,690
you may be trying to do attribution
work for a nation state.

490
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,970
And, and it doesn't just have
to be people who have worked

491
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,950
for a three letter agency
in the U S psychology

492
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,030
and sociology may be able to really help.

493
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,750
So start thinking about what rounds out

494
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,930
that work that you're actually hiring for.

495
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,760
And you may be realized
that different kinds

496
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,820
of backgrounds are going to
be very valuable to this.

497
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,370
- And when we talk about like,
you know, again, reskilling

498
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,300
and we need to step back and think

499
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,300
that not only one type of
person should we be hiring

500
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,000
or rather than diversity
set, as, as an education

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,090
as an educator, there are different paths.

502
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,580
And we are now far

503
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,429
advanced than traditional
education system.

504
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,770
So it depends on where you are skillset

505
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,310
at and where do you work
like, you know, fit in.

506
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,740
Not everybody is coming
from the same route.

507
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,420
Everybody has a different background.

508
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,430
So if some people are like

509
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,940
like small environment that,
that, that then like, you know

510
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,150
overwhelming of large universities

511
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,490
they can go to community college

512
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,030
and have a associate
degree and then pursue

513
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,700
and transfer those credits
to four year of college.

514
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,970
And then, you know,
pursue their education.

515
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,370
If they're interested,
they can also do both.

516
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,560
They can work simultaneously full-time

517
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,870
and do community college,
all do boot camps.

518
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,250
And those boot camps
also offers if you are

519
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,860
from a different major and
want to switch to cybersecurity

520
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,310
those boot camps are
foundation to help you to

521
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,240
create an environment, give confidence

522
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,860
that what is encryption,
what is networking?

523
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,260
What is foundational concept

524
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,720
of open source intelligence starting?

525
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
And then when we talk about
certifications also comes

526
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,629
with training as well,
find the opportunities

527
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,260
add with the scholarship opportunities.

528
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,093
Reach out to people.

529
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:55,150
If somebody can sponsor you as well.

530
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,020
There are folks who will
be interested in sponsoring

531
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,400
and there is continuous
education and learning

532
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,550
when we talk about

533
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,169
and we can show our skills
with different hackers

534
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,640
one background, and, you know, Diana

535
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,270
you have experience with the,
you know, talking about like

536
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,113
you know, CTX and other things,
any thoughts in this talking

537
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:17,946
about?

538
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,530
- Yeah. Thank you.

539
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,680
Yeah, it's true.

540
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,080
I mean, as Devee was
saying, you know, there are

541
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,909
there are so many great
programs and certainly

542
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,822
going to school, I mean,
is a professor, right?

543
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:31,199
Teaching cyber security, you know

544
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,551
so there's a lot of great experience

545
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:36,040
that you've are at least
knowledge that you can get

546
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,510
from those boot camps and everything.

547
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,760
But there's, if you want
to like, add to that

548
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,610
think about a little bit of box breaking

549
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,000
with going out and showing your skills.

550
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,300
And some examples are you can actually

551
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,110
make some money doing this too.

552
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,179
And this is something that

553
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,060
as a student, whether you're reskilling.

554
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,360
So whether you're coming in from another

555
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,500
you've had a different career

556
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,320
and you've decided that's
no longer the right career

557
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,153
for you.

558
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:01,240
So you want to maybe explore
cyber, get into cyber.

559
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,230
Or if you're just graduating from school

560
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,650
you can augment all that,
even your internships and your

561
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,570
your degree and your certifications.

562
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,740
You can augment that

563
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,890
augment that by showing your skills and

564
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,270
there's an annual every
time on DEFCON, which is the

565
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,020
it was the conference that

566
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,230
that actually existed
before Black Hat existed.

567
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,810
And then Black Hat was sort of
made to be the business side

568
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,260
of DEFCON but they both still run.

569
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,340
So after Black Hat, you
probably heard of Black Hat

570
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,639
DEFCON runs as the weekend after Black Hat

571
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,890
they have a capture the
flag event every year.

572
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,170
So that's something that you can show,

573
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,170
Hey I was able to win this
contest HackerOne, Bugcrowd

574
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,200
and then some companies like Microsoft

575
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,250
they're offering big, big bounties

576
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,430
if you go, and you find a vulnerability

577
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,010
and you report it properly.

578
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,920
So with all of these bounty kinds

579
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,020
of programs that we're talking
about, there are parameters

580
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,800
of acceptable use within
the bounty program.

581
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,360
So be sure that you've read
all the terms and conditions.

582
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,530
You understand what scoped and what's

583
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,480
out of scope once you've done
that, it's quite possible.

584
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,600
In addition to having a really
good resume builder to break

585
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,629
out of the box with,
you may also be able to

586
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,657
earn a little bit of coin, I think, right.

587
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,090
You know, that there's some

588
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,360
like a hundred, $150,000
bounties, depending

589
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,879
on what that company is
looking for the person to

590
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,160
to go try and find as
far as the vulnerability.

591
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,130
So if you want to kind of stretch yourself

592
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,910
stretch your chops, you can start looking

593
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,840
at some of these programs.

594
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,570
And if you're a hiring manager

595
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,060
strongly advise you to take seriously

596
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,090
if somebody has listed one
of these on their resume

597
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,429
what it shows is they went

598
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,590
and they've responsibly were
able to find a vulnerability

599
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,370
or in a very competitive environment

600
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,610
with a lot of very skilled
hackers, good hackers, right?

601
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,260
The right side of not
being criminal hackers

602
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,020
but at something like a DEFCON CTF

603
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,560
they were able to successfully win that.

604
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,929
So that actually tells you a lot

605
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,483
as the hiring manager about
what they're capable of.

606
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,923
All right.

607
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:10,250
So how about recruiting
if you've ever applied

608
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,040
for a job online, one of the pain point

609
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,560
and it's interesting cause it's technology

610
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
I think they were trying
to break the box initially

611
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,600
with this kind of technology,
but it's caused a lot of agita

612
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,480
which is ATS or the
Applicant Tracking Systems.

613
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,930
So, in these systems,
what they're looking for

614
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,290
is there a matching a job words

615
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,850
to the resume

616
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,110
so the job description words to the resume

617
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,419
and if they don't get the match very often

618
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,540
they're throwing out
really good candidates.

619
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,379
And I know that that
can be very frustrating.

620
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,613
And if we go back to that
original slide that we showed

621
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,720
where the Redditor was
saying, I've applied

622
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,810
for a thousand jobs
and I'm not getting any

623
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,950
there's a good bet that
underneath at least a number

624
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,070
of those rejections was
just a mismatch in the ATS.

625
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,350
So that candidate's
resume might just not have

626
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,709
had the exact, the exact words that were

627
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,300
that the ATS was looking for.

628
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,290
So this has caused some,
some act in recruiting.

629
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,889
And if you are a company using this

630
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,240
and you feel like you're just
not getting the talent pool

631
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,560
you might want to look

632
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,889
at how you're using and
implementing ATS, you know

633
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,410
the also job descriptions themselves.

634
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,010
Yeah we talked a little bit
before about the, you know

635
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,910
the person who graduates from
college and they're like,

636
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,810
Hey we want five years of experience.

637
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,480
Also I've seen these job
descriptions that it looks like

638
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,620
you know, I look at it

639
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,929
and I've been doing this
for, for a long time.

640
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,160
And I feel like, wow, I should
have the skills to do that.

641
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,420
But they're asking for so
much, like the they've really

642
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,510
they want basically the kitchen sink.

643
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,340
And again, for, for if
you're a hiring manager

644
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,149
or if you're, if you're working in HR

645
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,660
maybe rethink about these
job descriptions, if you

646
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,470
if don't write the job description

647
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,900
that's double what you want.

648
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,020
Cause you figure, add people
are just going to apply

649
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,510
whether they only have 50%

650
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,780
of that skillset or not
really write the job

651
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,260
very clearly for who you want.

652
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,840
And also think about the language in it.

653
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,510
You know, if you say he
as you're saying you know

654
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,440
this person is the engineer

655
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,670
he is going to do this and
he is going to do that.

656
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,560
That might disincentive
somebody who isn't the

657
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,929
he doesn't use those
pronouns to think, well

658
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,220
maybe this job isn't for me.

659
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,790
- When you talk about
like different things

660
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,210
and it's very, very important
to create an inclusive

661
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,860
environment for everybody,
not starting from the, like

662
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,159
you know, starting from
the job description because

663
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,050
you know, half of the
population may not be he and

664
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,970
that our other half of the
population in the world who also

665
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,340
interested in smart
and equally intelligent

666
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,360
and would like to contribute to this

667
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,540
and I'm doing really great
work in the cybersecurity.

668
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,750
- Yeah.

669
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,800
And some really fun
recruiting box breakers

670
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,290
that have come out now are

671
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,350
like

672
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,439
Amazon went on Tinder and said,

673
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,420
we're hiring engineers, which is

674
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,930
I don't know how effective that was

675
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,760
but it's great that
they're just trying to sort

676
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
of break the box their own way.

677
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,189
And then Google actually went

678
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,193
out and bought a, a, a billboard.

679
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,780
And they put this here,
over here, you know

680
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,629
first 10 digit prime found
in consecutive digits e.com.

681
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,450
And that's all that was on the billboard.

682
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,550
And their thinking was well

683
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,220
they wanted really creative engineers

684
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,500
and they felt that creative
engineers would be challenged

685
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,650
by this and go out and respond.

686
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,060
And that's exactly what
happened with that recruiting.

687
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,540
So this is instead of
having job descriptions

688
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,360
that may be confusing or
ATS systems that may be

689
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,709
knocking out out some of
your really good candidates.

690
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,520
These are really creative ways
to start saying let's hire

691
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,879
in the way that we want our people to be

692
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,660
but see if they're creative or
social, I guess, in the case

693
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,470
to Tinder and creating and again

694
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,879
you know, really interested
and investigatory

695
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,730
in the case of the Google bill board.

696
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,933
- Yes,

697
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,229
that's, that's really awesome.

698
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,000
And when we talk about like, you know

699
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,980
in this type of environment

700
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,110
we really

701
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,909
make sure that

702
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,720
environment of this type of like

703
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,750
you know, where to get the news, what do

704
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,150
where to get the job
description or job posts

705
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,000
and also mentioned like
Twitter, LinkedIn and

706
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,840
Facebook and all social media websites.

707
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,929
And like, you know, nowadays
poster is available everywhere.

708
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,640
Like, you know, when you interact

709
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,770
but how do we get this, you know, job?

710
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,190
Is it a traditional, like go

711
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,140
to the website and apply for the job?

712
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,110
Well, the scenario has
changed it's 2021 and

713
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,479
that is networking, mentorship,
you know, that is advocacy.

714
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,850
And so the networking part
is very, very important.

715
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,870
I stress in my class and
wherever I go and speak about it

716
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,882
because it's very, very
important that if you are

717
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:48,990
in a virtual mentoring
session, a networking session

718
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,420
if you are attending virtual
conferences, I'm talking about

719
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,860
in a COVID situation, try to
get the contact information

720
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,060
add them on LinkedIn and,
you know, have an email chat

721
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,500
or maybe a virtual
coffee on virtual lunch.

722
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,250
So that's how they kind of
get to know each other where

723
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,902
we are not physically meet.

724
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:10,880
When we go back to the normal, they say

725
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
try to like reach out to
people who can help you.

726
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,879
Like, it can be a professor,
you can be a hiring manager

727
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,880
it can be like, you know, your, like

728
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,180
in your own circle, in your, like

729
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,730
who can help you in your
spiritual group as well.

730
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,480
So like, hey, I, I'm trying
to break into cybersecurity.

731
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,470
Would you please introduce
me if you don't know anybody?

732
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,107
Another thing is that mentorship
and which I think Diana

733
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:37,770
and I both do in a mentorship program

734
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,010
which is helping others and kind of giving

735
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,170
back what we got help as well.

736
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,310
And also it helps others
to understand that

737
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,530
you know, that, hey, you are not alone.

738
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,670
I'm here with you.

739
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,360
Let's, let's help each other out

740
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,080
that it's a mentoring
session when you also learn

741
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,913
from your mentees.

742
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:56,800
And currently I'm doing mentorship

743
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,169
with recess and I have five mentees.

744
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,230
It's a kind of like give and
take healthy relationship.

745
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,100
I'm learning from them and
they're learning from me.

746
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,449
So it's very very important
having a mentor who can navigate

747
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,360
with this storm of like, you know

748
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,320
how to build your career
and get a job and, you know

749
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,730
and go in a right track because, you know

750
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,390
it's an umbrella of cybersecurity.

751
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,700
What is the specialty of
passion and the advocacy.

752
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,610
When we talk about
cybersecurity advocacy and

753
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,929
you know, Diana, I would love
to have your thoughts on that.

754
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,610
When you talk about like
advocacy and, you know

755
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,370
being an advocate of cybersecurity
and reverse mentoring

756
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,312
how do you encourage
people to be a part of it?

757
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,980
- Yes is it's important to understand

758
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,590
that there are advocates and mentors.

759
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,409
You may have the same one,
but an advocate is somebody

760
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,090
at the company that you're working for.

761
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,879
Who's going to, or out
in the, in the field

762
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,210
who's going to advocate
for you and your career.

763
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,040
They really help when
you've got an advocate

764
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,010
within your own company

765
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,070
cause they can help you to see barriers

766
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,980
or hurdles to your advancement.

767
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,680
A mentor can be somebody in
or outside of your company.

768
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,550
That is more about like talking to you

769
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,323
as a person and listening
to your career issues

770
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:08,900
and maybe helping you with the
experience that they've got.

771
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,070
So you need both advocates and mentors

772
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,710
and then I strongly
recommend reverse mentorship.

773
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,040
The farther that you
get along in your career

774
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,050
the more important it is to keep talking

775
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,620
to people that are younger than you

776
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,880
and understand what they're doing

777
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,190
and how they're changing things

778
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,520
so that you can stay really fresh.

779
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,150
And some of the new
networking that's out there

780
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,277
and available are things like

781
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,389
if you don't have employee resource groups

782
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,810
at your company yet start looking at that.

783
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,639
So you can bring people that
are like-minded together

784
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,480
you know, and it can really

785
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,010
it surprisingly it can help when I was

786
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,860
at Microsoft or as a
member of the vegan ERG.

787
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,469
And at first I was like, what is this?

788
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,029
And then I realized, Oh my gosh, you know

789
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,909
like it's actually
really kind of fun to be

790
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,159
around people that, that are also vegan

791
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,870
and dealing with, you know, a
lot of times people are mean

792
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,339
to us about the fact that we're vegan.

793
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,480
So it was just kind of nice to be able to

794
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,170
to have that or virtual mentors again

795
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,620
and getting a lot of
virtual stuff going on.

796
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,462
So virtual mentors at USC.

797
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,220
So with that, we just wanted to wrap with

798
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,959
apply what you've learned today.

799
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
So next week, please

800
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,290
if you're a hiring, I'm
gonna cover hiring managers

801
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,700
if you're the hiring manager,
think about what you're doing

802
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,629
versus some of these box
breakers that we talked about.

803
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,080
If you're a, if you're trying to get hired

804
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,730
- If you're trying to get
hired, always think about that.

805
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,630
What as hiring managers
are looking for and looking

806
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,690
at the job description,
very, very important

807
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,483
that what particular talent
you have, and it is very

808
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,340
very important.

809
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,720
Also like if you don't qualify for 100%

810
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,970
do apply, it's not only
100% they look for.

811
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,029
It's like a general description.

812
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,350
That can be many things,
which is part of, so

813
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,069
don't get discouraged
of like, okay, I don't

814
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,600
have all the checklist.

815
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,960
So look for what you
have, have everything.

816
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,270
And, you know, your
education internships make

817
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,543
your resume suit, and you
will be able to like, you know

818
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:07,543
take that next step when you,
you know, if you are hiring.

819
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,080
- And if you're from three months from now

820
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,200
if you're a hiring manager, take a look

821
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,390
after you've thought about
some of your current processes

822
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,740
and where they might
be enabling you to hire

823
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,850
think about what those test cases

824
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,500
from the box breakers that we shared

825
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,830
or the old box breakers
that you're thinking of

826
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,706
what might you want to
actually start implementing

827
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:28,340
within your hiring program?

828
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,077
- And if you are looking
for a job and look for that

829
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:34,830
within three months, what you
have developed after this talk

830
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,040
and what are the takeaways
and where did you have a plan?

831
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,163
Did you find a mentor or
did you do it certification?

832
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,430
So that's kind of like take it away.

833
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,917
And within six months as it high, you know

834
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,540
if you're a hiring and looking for jobs

835
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,029
add your job description into a role

836
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,150
and explain what you have
done in cybersecurity.

837
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,980
- Yeah pay it forward.

838
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,050
Cause that can really
help you can be the change

839
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,760
at the companies that you go to.

840
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,370
And if you're a hiring manager, of course

841
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,515
if you've implemented some
new programs, figure out

842
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,315
do some measurement and optimization

843
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:07,880
to see if they're working.

844
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,540
We have, we had a ton of
resources here for you.

845
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,100
There are even more out there that you can

846
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,410
you can go and look at
things like girls who code

847
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,940
and some of the other references we made

848
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,330
but we have a shortlist of
those resources right here.

849
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,850
So you can take a deeper look

850
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,310
at some of the information that we shared.

851
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,960
And with that, I want to
thank you so much Devee

852
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,820
for breaking the box with me.

853
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,440
And we hope everybody, we
hope you picked up a couple of

854
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,340
of hints and ideas about how
either as a hiring manager

855
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,370
or someone out looking for a job

856
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,700
that you can break the box and help to

857
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,259
close the cybersecurity
skills gap going forward

858
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,140
cause we need more good people in cyber.

859
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,973
Right.

860
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,460
- I completely agree with
you and Diana, thank you

862
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,470
as a prospective of
hiring and other, you know

863
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,919

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,603

Thank you everybody.
