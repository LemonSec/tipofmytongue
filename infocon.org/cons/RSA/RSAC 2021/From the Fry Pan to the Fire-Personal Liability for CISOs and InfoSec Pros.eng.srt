1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,140
- Hi everybody.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,689
I'm Aravind Swaminathan,
I'm the Global Co-Chair of

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,039
Orick's Cybersecurity
Data Privacy Practice.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,943
I am based in Seattle.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,380
And just quick by way of introductions,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,150
I'll let Mark introduce himself.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,300
I'm a former federal prosecutor.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,470
I'm actually a white collar
criminal defense lawyer

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,869
as well as a cybersecurity
incident responder

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,560
for our clients, so I'm on the legal side.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,939
So we help clients from all manner

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,740
of cybersecurity incidents
from compliance issues

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,949
at the beginning to crisis
response all the way

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,330
through the litigation
regulatory enforcement actions.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,280
And just today, my experience
and how I'll be speaking

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,620
to this issue is

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,010
partly with my background
as a federal prosecutor,

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,140
partly with my background as

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,260
a white collar criminal defense lawyer,

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,760
partly with my background as a

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,470
lawyer in the cybersecurity
incident response space,

22
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,710
and then also having
represented individuals CISOs

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,323
in particular around the issues

24
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,290
that we're gonna talk about today.

25
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,990
So Mark, I'll hand it over to you.

26
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,540
- Thanks Aravind.

27
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,960
So I am currently the Chief
Information Security Officer,

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,366
AlertEnterprise and also
the Chief Strategy Officer

29
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,080
for the National Cybersecurity Center,

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,860
but I've been a CISO or CSO

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,270
four times previously, in addition to

32
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,973
a couple of other senior
security kind of roles.

33
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,039
Aravind and I have given
this talk or a similar talk

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,560
to this a number of times,

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,100
but this year it's a little
bit more important, I think.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,973
And we'll get into some of
that as we go along here.

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,753
Won't you go ahead and go to
the first slide, then Aravind.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,103
So as I said, we've done
this a number of times.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,070
But I think, the recent
charges against Joe Sullivan

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,119
when he was at Uber have
raised the bar for CISOs

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,523
and really they should be
attention-getting for everyone.

42
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,040
At least for every CISO and
for ease of conversation,

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm gonna use the term
CISO and CSO synonymously

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,253
but rest assured I do know the difference.

45
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,150
So you know, I like to ask,
not that you can answer me

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,190
but how many calls have you
been on in the past year

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,190
or two where you were
concerned about CSO liability?

48
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,450
And I know that Aravind and I
have talked about this a lot.

49
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,359
We've been on this on a number
of these kinds of calls.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,130
So we're gonna talk today about a lot

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,549
of the preemployment
questions you should ask

52
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,630
and probably some of the legal issues

53
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,549
that you should be concerned
about as a CSO, CISO today.

54
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,550
And I guess I would just kind
of set the tone with this.

55
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,459
Following an incident and
during the incident response,

56
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,920
you are the company and the company is you

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,549
until something bad happens.

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,300
And that's when you're gonna be

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,983
the first person that gets shot.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,833
So go on to the next one, Aravind.

61
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,070
So these are just a few of
the examples that highlight

62
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,963
the employment and financial
liabilities facing CISOs today.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,440
Target, every one of these
things have had implications

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,660
not just for the CISOs involved with them,

65
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,560
but really for all of us,

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,650
for everyone in the CISO community

67
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,180
that has had to deal with these or

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,940
deal with questions of these.

69
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,780
Because I expect, and
we're gonna talk about this

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,320
a little bit more later, I
expect that anybody that reports

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,846
to the board has had questions
from the board about,

72
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:47,030
"Okay, these different breaches,
could these happen to us?

73
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,810
And if they did happen to
us, how would we respond?

74
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,210
How would we react to them?"

75
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,120
These are not new. We've
just in the past week,

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,393
dealing with the Colonial
Pipeline incident,

77
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:03,100
the ongoing implications of this are

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,390
just now starting to come out.

79
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,785
It's going to be interesting to see

80
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:11,320
how liability points
back at the security team

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,340
and the security
professionals at Colonial.

82
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,370
- And I think just to highlight

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,700
something that Mark said.

84
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,099
There's a headline here about
the most recent incident

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,010
involved AOL CIO,

86
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,289
which some of you don't even remember AOL

87
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,980
but that article was in 2008, right?

88
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,340
So there's been discussion about this

89
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,924
for quite a long time to Mark's point,

90
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,650
but it's now that I really think

91
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,169
that we're coming to a head

92
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,538
and you know, here's what
we're really looking at.

93
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,600
So today what we're gonna talk about

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,860
are predominantly criminal issues.

95
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,950
We're going to talk a little bit about

96
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,930
some of the civil issues,

97
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,650
but we're really gonna
look at criminal liability,

98
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,380
largely in the landscape or
in the wake of Joe's case.

99
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,820
But these aren't really new.

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,409
So what we're seeing is

101
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,670
a bunch of different
theories on which liability

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,660
could be premised.

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,450
And on the criminal side.

104
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,510
And again, for those of you
that don't know the difference

105
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,490
between criminal and civil,
criminal is you go to jail.

106
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,990
Civil is you pay money.

107
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,172
Now you can also pay money with criminal,

108
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,480
but criminal is really
somebody's butt is going to land

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
behind bars.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,820
And when you're looking at those charges

111
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,099
we're looking at things
like false statements,

112
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,260
securities fraud, mail and wire fraud,

113
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,680
and then as we'll touch
on in just a second,

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
two theories that have
come up in Joe's case

115
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,722
which are obstruction of justice
and misprision of felony.

116
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,299
Just to be clear, this is not
all about the case of Uber.

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,610
What we're gonna use though is we're gonna

118
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,200
kinda go through a couple
timelines of events,

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,620
just so people who are in the audience

120
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,300
can level set a little bit.

121
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,810
Understand kind of what's the context

122
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,460
that Mark and I are talking about here.

123
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,680
So most of you may have
already read the indictment.

124
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,370
And so everything I'm
about to say regarding

125
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,370
Joe Sullivan's case is all allegations.

126
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,530
These aren't proven, he's
innocent until proven guilty.

127
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,133
He's got a criminal trial
that will be coming up

128
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,640
probably late summer or in the fall.

129
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,050
And so these are the allegations

130
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,230
that the government has stated, right?

131
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,780
And most of these are
pretty familiar to folks

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,453
that kinda know this story.

133
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,010
Uber suffers a breach,

134
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,969
Joe Sullivan takes the helm in 2015.

135
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,293
He provides testimony to the FTC,

136
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,070
later after the testimony,

137
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,943
hackers email Uber about
a new security event.

138
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:36,660
Joe Sullivan updates the
FTC about the old event,

139
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,003
not on the 2016 event that
came on November 14th.

140
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,299
They pay the hackers a
hundred thousand dollars

141
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,840
in part of their bug bounty program.

142
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:50,600
Uber identifies the hacker,
they get them to sign an NDA.

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,970
And then what happens is the problems,

144
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,800
which is the FTC then
makes further inquiries.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,010
There's no disclosure at
that point of the 2016 event.

146
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,010
Dara takes role as the CEO in 2017.

147
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,270
And then the 2016 event
is publicly disclosed.

148
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,330
So those are essentially
the allegations, right?

149
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,073
And if you were to just
microcosm those for a moment,

150
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,005
they are one breach.

151
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,530
You have regulatory
obligations and are talking

152
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,179
to the FTC in particular.

153
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,238
New breach, non-disclosure to the FTC

154
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,300
and the charges arise out of that.

155
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,800
We'll talk a little bit
about those as we move on.

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,460
Yahoo! is another case study

157
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,930
where we have a very similar
kind of fact pattern, right?

158
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,910
You have a 2016 event

159
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,830
where Verizon's going to acquire them.

160
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,909
And then right after that
is the first disclosure

161
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,910
about an event that occurred back in 2014.

162
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,360
So again, what's the common theme?

163
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,520
These are events that aren't disclosed.

164
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,289
The common theme is these
two events are events

165
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,740
that aren't disclosed kind of right

166
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,350
in time with when they're happening.

167
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,920
And that sort of creates the problems.

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,960
In Yahoo!, the board initiated
an independent investigation,

169
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,673
it interviewed witnesses.

170
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,210
There was an announcement
of a second breach

171
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,643
as that investigation was ongoing,

172
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,020
Yahoo! files an SEC Form 10-K,

173
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,530
which we're going to talk
about in a little bit

174
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,863
with some more detail.

175
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,160
There're shareholder derivative actions,

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,610
so these are lawsuits that are filed,

177
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,530
these are civil lawsuits
where shareholders are

178
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,870
saying to Verizon "You're
paying too much money for Yahoo!

179
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,200
look at this breach, it's
not worth that much."

180
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
The purchase price ended up
getting lowered by $350 million.

181
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,559
The SEC is conducting an investigation,

182
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,329
they settle with Yahoo!.

183
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,450
There is meanwhile, by the way

184
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,020
also a criminal investigation
that went on at the same time,

185
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,920
we're gonna talk a little bit about.

186
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,189
And then Yahoo! announced the settlements

187
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,190
of the class action.

188
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,569
Your third story, again not anything

189
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,860
that people aren't
familiar with, are Equifax.

190
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,860
And again, the breach gets
announced, the shares plunge

191
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,397
there's immediate retirement
of the CIO and the CSO.

192
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,990
You have Equifax announcing to customers.

193
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,320
There's a series of investigations.

194
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,203
The CEO then retires.

195
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,160
And you get a whole series,
a cavalcade of incidents.

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,530
The most important of which are that

197
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,214
the former CIO is charged
criminally with insider trading.

198
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,670
And again, we're going to get
to that as well in a second.

199
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,849
So just so folks have an idea,

200
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,580
these three events are sort of a microcosm

201
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,370
for breaches that we see all over, right?

202
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,140
Some of them are not as big
obviously as Yahoo! or Equifax,

203
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,420
or not as well publicized,

204
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,180
but it doesn't mean that the
stakes are any less, right?

205
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,910
These happen to be the ones
that are most discussed,

206
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,530
most talked about,

207
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,720
the ones that people
are most interested in.

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,070
But we have been involved personally

209
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,540
with a number of other
security events where

210
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,236
either the SEC or the DOJ,

211
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,110
so a civil enforcement authority

212
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,940
and a criminal enforcement authority

213
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,510
are looking at "C-Suiters",

214
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,960
particularly the CISOs
and asking themselves

215
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,360
do these folks have any
personal responsibility?

216
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,070
In other words, should we hold
them personally responsible

217
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,270
for the issues that came
up in this situation.

218
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,020
Whether it's civilly or criminally.

219
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,060
From just those three,
there's a whole series

220
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,949
of legal ramifications, right?

221
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,860
And let me just talk about

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,580
what each of these are really quickly.

223
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,020
So we've talked about a
DOJ, Department of Justice

224
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,590
Criminal Investigation and Prosecution.

225
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,050
There are Securities
class action litigation.

226
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,449
So that is when shareholders
bring a class action

227
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,964
against the company, saying essentially

228
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:43,000
that company executives misled them,

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,020
failed to disclose important information

230
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,640
that impacted their decision
to buy or not buy the stock

231
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,840
and then caused them
damage when the stock price

232
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,170
changes post disclosure of the event.

233
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,219
So the event gets announced,
stock price goes down,

234
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,100
shareholders are angry
because if they had known

235
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,610
something that you didn't disclose,

236
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,770
they claim they wouldn't have bought it or

237
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,689
would've sold it earlier.

238
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,940
Shareholder derivative
litigation is a different kind

239
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,030
of related litigation
where the shareholders

240
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,180
actually step into the
shoes of the company

241
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,790
and sue the board of
directors and the management,

242
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,410
and say "You guys
personally failed in your

243
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,650
fiduciary duties."

244
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,040
So that's a situation
which is a little bit of

245
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,819
sort of a legal contrivance but that's

246
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,050
another type of civil litigation.

247
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,650
There are consumer class actions.

248
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,310
We're all pretty familiar with those.

249
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,560
That's where consumers who
are people whose information

250
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,680
was lost decide to sue.

251
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,229
There're Congressional Hearings,
more and more coming up,

252
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,150
where individuals are
hauled in front of Congress

253
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,130
and have to actually
testify about what happened.

254
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,633
And then there's a cavalcade
of regulatory investigations.

255
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,832
Federal Trade Commission,
State Attorneys General, SEC.

256
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,290
And then if you are
regulated internationally,

257
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,160
ICO, Turkish Data Protection Authority.

258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,300
So there's a whole list of, you know

259
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,250
three letter alphabet list of

260
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,950
entities that can bring litigation

261
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,980
or pursue responsibility for individuals.

262
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,620
Okay, we're gonna dig in
really deep to the Yahoo! case.

263
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,453
Just to talk about that
one for a little bit.

264
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,240
So, as I mentioned before, in Yahoo!

265
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,880
what happened was around September

266
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,640
the event that happened
in 2014 was discovered.

267
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,257
And the board initiated what's called a

268
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,339
"Special Investigation Committee"

269
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,770
to investigate the instance.

270
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,220
So they hired their own
lawyers who went out

271
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,720
and collected hundreds of
thousands of pages of documents.

272
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,750
They interviewed dozens and
dozens of employees, right?

273
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,220
One of which we represented in the case

274
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,110
of that investigation.

275
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,670
And they did an independent investigation

276
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,329
and came up with findings.

277
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,350
And in sort of a rare step,

278
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,840
the company disclosed those
findings in a public filing.

279
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,650
And so the public filing,

280
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,340
so the investigation
happens, you know, late 2016.

281
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,310
And then in early 2017,
they released a 10-K

282
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,439
and here's what the key parts of it are.

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,240
The information security team
had contemporaneous knowledge

284
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,110
of the 2014 compromise of user accounts.

285
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,150
The InfoSec team understood
that the attacker

286
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,449
exfiltrated copies of the user database

287
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,340
backup files containing
personal data of Yahoo! users

288
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,260
but it's unclear whether and
to what extent such evidence

289
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,740
of exfiltration was
effectively communicated

290
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,463
and understood outside the InfoSec team.

291
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,760
The Independent Committee did not conclude

292
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
there was an intentional suppression

293
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,800
of relevant information.

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,390
The 2014 incident was
not properly investigated

295
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,949
and analyzed at the time.

296
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,930
And the failures in communication,
management, inquiry,

297
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,430
and internal reporting
contributed to the lack

298
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,989
of proper comprehension and
handling of the 2014 incident.

299
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,690
So that's what the
special committee found,

300
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,720
and the company publicly announced that.

301
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,970
So Mark, I'm gonna ask
you to put yourselves

302
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,610
in the shoes of the Chief
Information Security Officer

303
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,920
at Yahoo! who oversaw
that breach, or any of

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,360
the incident responders, and you know,

305
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,133
what's your thought coming out of that?

306
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,490
What just happened?

307
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,940
What did the company just do?

308
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,852
- Well, the company just put
the security team on report,

309
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:10,310
as we would say in the Navy,

310
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,289
and basically I think exposed

311
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,463
the CISO and the security team

312
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:21,433
to further litigation potentially.

313
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,080
And so this is really important

314
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,244
in the Yahoo! case, but I would,

315
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,820
and this is the question I ask to CISOs

316
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,380
all the time is, how many people

317
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,943
actually help write the
10-K and the 10-Q forms?

318
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,313
If you haven't read these things
before they get published,

319
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,220
you are missing something
really, really relevant.

320
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,330
I remember the first time I read a 10-Q

321
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,520
I almost had a heart attack.

322
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,870
There were things in
there that I would never

323
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,020
in a million years put on paper

324
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,920
about threats and
vulnerabilities and incidents.

325
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,060
And these 10-Qs and 10-Ks,
they're almost always completed

326
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,573
by the legal team.

327
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,140
But the CSO, I mean, as you see right here

328
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,040
you have responsibilities in there.

329
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,900
So if you don't have any input and

330
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,260
really, editing authority,
you're accepting a lot

331
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,150
of liabilities that you
truly may not understand.

332
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,910
So I always advise people to make sure

333
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,819
that they have actual editing authority

334
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,680
on the 10-Ks and the 10-Qs because

335
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,092
you know, they typically
just talk about risks

336
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:36,925
and the risks

337
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,650
that you may be responsible for.

338
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,410
But when you get into really
details like this sometimes,

339
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,939
these things can come back and
bite you in a big, big way.

340
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,570
- And it's such an important point, right?

341
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,570
I mean, here is the company
essentially throwing

342
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,530
not just the CISO, not just
the head of incident response

343
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,550
but basically the entire IT
security team under the bus.

344
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,663
Which in 2017, this was March of 2017,

345
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,960
reputationally could be disastrous.

346
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,793
Right, Mark?

347
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,113
I mean that's the other thing,

348
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,790
which is they basically called
them to the carpet and said

349
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,700
these guys didn't do what
they were supposed to do.

350
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,393
And that's based on their
own internal investigation.

351
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,507
- And you know, and
something you may remember

352
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,199
you know, you mentioned earlier

353
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,490
about congressional
hearings, all these guys

354
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,760
ended up doing the
congressional perp walk.

355
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,870
You know, they had to go
and explain to Congress,

356
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,270
explain to legislators,
you know, what happened

357
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,240
why they did this, explain
to the SEC and, you know

358
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,990
we'll get into this a little
bit more, but you know

359
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,210
these things happen sometimes
years after the fact.

360
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,060
So sometimes it's hard to
remember exactly what happened

361
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,433
in the heat of an event.

362
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,860
- Yep, exactly.

363
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,587
Exactly. So Mark, let's take a look at

364
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:57,610
and you can address a little
bit of these, you know

365
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,810
how other companies have
reacted publicly when

366
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,310
they've had similar instances.

367
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,941
- Yeah. I mean, so again

368
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,930
these are just, go ahead
and click on the next one.

369
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,569
These are just the kind of instance

370
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,329
that how these things are communicated

371
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,270
to the public can really have implications

372
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,660
long after the initial disclosure.

373
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,510
So making sure that these
communications are crisp

374
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,270
and to the point is critical.

375
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,797
And you know, just like
you see here for Uber,

376
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,903
"We continue to fully"
investigate, you know

377
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,600
the DOJs or "cooperate with DOJ".

378
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,719
And then the other one,
"We launched a review

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,553
of his trade..."

380
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:37,830
These things, if they're worded, you know

381
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,750
if there's nuance in the wording

382
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,750
it can really make the CISO
or the security team look bad.

383
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,530
- Yep. Yeah, exactly.

384
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,899
There's a couple questions in the chat

385
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,050
I'm just gonna flag here.

386
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,280
There's a question also
about the legal team

387
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,940
and how Yahoo! treated the legal team.

388
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,740
And I'm gonna get to that in a second

389
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,307
when we talk about the SECs
findings in just a moment.

390
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:04,527
And then there was another
question in the chat, Mark,

391
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,100
about having members of the
security team have direct input

392
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,070
into the public SEC filings.

393
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,490
I think you talked a little bit about that

394
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,970
but maybe it's worth just
spending another second here

395
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,220
to talk about the process that

396
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,930
typically you've gone
through when you know,

397
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,260
those filings are getting ready

398
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
and maybe just talk a little about that

399
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,133
then I'll add a little
bit of color to that.

400
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,710
- Yeah you know, and

401
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,260
in my last company, it was about, you know

402
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,129
usually it's like eight weeks
before the end of the quarter,

403
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,020
the legal folks would draft up, you know,

404
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,610
the 10-Q and they would send it

405
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,870
over to me and say,
"Okay, here's the risks,

406
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,610
have there been any incidents that should

407
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:49,710
be publicly acknowledged?

408
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,410
Anything of any significance

409
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,540
that shareholders should be aware about?"

410
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,847
So that was my opportunity
then to go in and say,

411
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,810
"Okay, you know, the threatened
vulnerability environment

412
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,743
hasn't changed substantially
since last quarter,

413
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,750
we haven't had any security
incidents that were

414
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,750
of significance that would
impact shareholders positions."

415
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,425
So it was just my opportunity
to go in there and

416
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,500
highlight the things that
I wanted to highlight.

417
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,810
Sometimes, actually probably
more often than not,

418
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,169
we had this kind of proforma,

419
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,340
these are our risk categories,
and this is our risk status.

420
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,753
And I would go back and
say, "Well, wait a minute.

421
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:38,510
Ransomware has increased
30% in the last quarter

422
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,169
so we need to acknowledge
that in our 10-Q that you know

423
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:46,022
that we are at a higher
risk of Ransomware events

424
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:50,597
just because of the global
Ransomware pandemic."

425
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,370
Not only was it, I think
it was good for the company

426
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,117
but I mean, but it was me also saying,

427
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,770
"Hey I am not white washing any of this.

428
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm putting it all out there.

429
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,660
I want everybody to
know the risk and threat

430
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,740
environment that we're living in today."

431
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,823
- And I think,

432
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,620
the way a lot of companies will do it is

433
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,000
whereas they're preparing
the risk factors, right

434
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,290
as you've just described, right?

435
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,000
What are the risks to the company?

436
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,890
They should be typically coming

437
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,453
to somebody who leads IT
security, whether it's a director

438
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,652
of IT security or a CISO, and saying,

439
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:32,303
"Here's what we articulate as the risks.

440
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:36,420
How have these changed since
the last time we did a filing

441
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,480
and are there material risks
that we want to disclose?"

442
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,290
Because again if you disclose
those as risks, they're part

443
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,260
of the defense that the
company is gonna use

444
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,340
if one of them actually
materialized, right?

445
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,490
'Cause what we don't want
to do is not tell the

446
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,840
shareholders what the risks actually are

447
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,899
and then say we've
withheld something, right?

448
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,747
So that's the opportunity to say,

449
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:57,240
"Look, Ransomware is a big deal.

450
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Look, supply chain attack's a big deal.

451
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,205
Look, if we have a business
continuity problem caused

452
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,730
by a cyber attack, right?

453
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,297
If it's ransomware or even something else,

454
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:10,166
that could impact our ability
to deliver services or goods

455
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,500
or whatever, to customers
or to our partners."

456
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,670
Or so on. And so you really
want to get into that.

457
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,250
And there should be a process

458
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,970
at most companies that are public

459
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,210
where the team that's putting

460
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,680
together disclosures are coming

461
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,330
to the Information Security Team, right.

462
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,399
And saying, what are our actual risks

463
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,890
and making sure that those
are adequately addressed

464
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,390
and identified in the filings.

465
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,830
- One thing we would also do

466
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,929
is if I made any significant
investments in security.

467
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,760
So if I did,

468
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,160
if I implemented two factor authentication

469
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,100
or I implemented, you know

470
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,580
new encryption schema
or, you know, anything

471
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,139
that was technologically significant.

472
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,050
I would put those things

473
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,724
in the 10-Q as well, because
we're mitigating risk

474
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:05,724
by spending money, by employing
these new technologies.

475
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,360
- Yeah, exactly.

476
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
So let's take a look at some

477
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,820
of the lawsuits that came out of this

478
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,030
'cause I think there was a question

479
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,667
in the chat about someone said, you know

480
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,580
"Aside from getting laid off or fired,

481
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,620
how much personal
liability exposure is there

482
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,120
for not just the CISO,

483
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,907
but some of the lower level
technical security staff?"

484
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:28,449
Low-level managers, incident responders,

485
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,260
sort of first-line defense.

486
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,550
And you know, and interestingly,

487
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,300
Yahoo! started something
that we've begun to see

488
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,870
more and more frequently.

489
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,489
Now this is not every situation,

490
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,400
but we are seeing this more often

491
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,790
that they're naming individuals.

492
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,100
Before, the securities class action

493
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,800
wouldn't name security professionals.

494
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,850
The consumer class action
wouldn't name individuals.

495
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,870
Now we're starting to see
more and more of that.

496
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,489
So for example, in the Yahoo!
securities litigation matter,

497
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,970
that's again where the
shareholders are suing

498
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,800
because the stock prices dropped,

499
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,403
they named Alex Stamos
individually as the CISO.

500
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,683
In Equifax and the
shareholder derivative case,

501
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,050
they named a number of
different people, hang on,

502
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,820
a number of different individuals

503
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,000
in the shareholder derivative case.

504
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,610
We then see the Equifax
Consumer Class Action

505
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,899
also names a number of individuals
and who are those folks?

506
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,610
Well, they're in IT security, right?

507
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,750
At various different levels, right?

508
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,410
All the way down to, you
know, people who are, you know

509
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,807
Corporate Legal and
Security Support at Equifax,

510
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:47,660
the Vice President of
IT Risk and Compliance,

511
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,600
the Senior Vice President of

512
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,409
IT Strategy and Effectiveness,

513
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,340
all the way down to IT Governance.

514
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,620
And so there's a lot of
different people that just

515
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,689
kinda got thrown in by plaintiff's lawyers

516
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,720
so they can put everybody
in the cross hairs.

517
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,940
And one of the things that we've
actually seen from the FTC,

518
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,320
so this is now the
federal regulatory body,

519
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,040
is the desire to hold
individuals accountable.

520
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,149
And so the FTC is stretching
its legs a little bit

521
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,540
and trying to see whether
it has the ability to

522
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,720
reach out and hold individuals accountable

523
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,710
in their regulatory enforcement actions.

524
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,920
Okay, let's go back to Yahoo!

525
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,020
So all of this is going on and

526
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,966
what ultimately happens in Yahoo!?

527
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,770
So Yahoo! took years to settle.

528
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,120
It settled about 15 months

529
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,370
after the 10-K that came out from Yahoo!

530
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,379
So we're now in 2018, sometime around May.

531
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,570
And the SEC conducted
its own investigation,

532
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,139
completely independent.

533
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,920
It asked for documents,
interviewed multiple witnesses,

534
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,490
we were representing a witness in front

535
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,330
of the SEC that testified
for a couple days.

536
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,476
And here's what the SEC said,

537
00:24:57,477 --> 00:25:00,200
"Within days after Yahoo!'s

538
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,410
Information Security Team
reached these conclusions,"

539
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,277
and this is about the exfiltration,

540
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,960
"Members of Yahoo! senior
management and legal teams

541
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,710
received various internal reports

542
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,890
from the Chief Information
Security Officer

543
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,342
stating that the theft of
hundreds of millions of Yahoo!

544
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:18,040
users' personal data had occurred.

545
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,270
The CISO communicated these conclusions

546
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,150
to at least one member of
the Yahoo! senior management

547
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,540
as Yahoo! was negotiating the sale

548
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,909
of its operating business to Verizon."

549
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,670
That's a very different story, right?

550
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,270
Very different story than
what the company announced.

551
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,500
But it took almost a
year and several months

552
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,360
for the truth to come out, right?

553
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,590
So the SEC, totally independent,

554
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,169
they got no dog in the fight.

555
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,550
And what they essentially
said was "No, no, no, no.

556
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,100
The Information Security
Team did their job.

557
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,840
They investigated this thing.

558
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,070
They figured out the data
was exfiltrated and they went

559
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,620
to senior management and
legal to announce it."

560
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,409
And it was the legal staff, right?

561
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,030
However, "Yahoo! senior management

562
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,149
and relevant legal staff did not properly

563
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,720
assess the scope, business impact,

564
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,380
or legal implications of the breach,

565
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,620
including how and where the breach

566
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,180
should have been disclosed

567
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,980
Yahoo!'s public filings", et cetera.

568
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,180
Very different story.

569
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,830
And I think one of the
things that is the undertone

570
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,919
or undercurrent of our conversation is,

571
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,418
yes there's criminal legal liability,

572
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,780
which we're going to talk about,

573
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,050
civil liability, which
we've talked a lot about.

574
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,830
But there's also reputational liability.

575
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,449
And one of the things that

576
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,570
Mark mentioned the beginning is, you know

577
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,860
watch the Yahoo! Information Security Team

578
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,429
get thrown under the
bus 15 months earlier,

579
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,000
it took that amount of time

580
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,650
for the truth to actually emerge.

581
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,670
So now that's the parade of
"horribles" that we've gone

582
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,240
through for like 27 or 30 minutes now.

583
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,180
Let's talk about key takeaways, Mark.

584
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,480
Let's talk about some of the
things that we think people

585
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,590
in the instant response world

586
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,270
or in the information
security world should be

587
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,180
doing to help protect
them in this context.

588
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,320
And the one thing I want to mention,

589
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,129
one thing before Mark kicks
off with the first thing,

590
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,900
is to echo something Mark
said at the beginning

591
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,000
which is really important.

592
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Most of the things we're
gonna talk about are,

593
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,451
if you do, it's where your interests

594
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,040
and the company's interests align.

595
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,480
In other words, by sort
of doing some of these

596
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,100
we're going to talk
about, you are not only

597
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,959
protecting the company, you
are protecting yourself, right?

598
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,920
So let's talk about what
some of those things are

599
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,890
because this is an
alignment of interest where

600
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,470
by following some best practices,

601
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,000
by following some things
that we've all heard

602
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,250
and talked about, we can insulate

603
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,440
both the company and ourselves.

604
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,010
So Mark, you want to take
some of these firsts?

605
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,210
- Sure. Go ahead and
put them all up there.

606
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,426
And you know, and I would say these are

607
00:27:34,426 --> 00:27:36,615
the "Jacks or better
to open" requirements.

608
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,311
You know, if you're not
doing these you are doing

609
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:42,209
your company and yourself a disservice.

610
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,204
And I cannot emphasize how
important number four is,

611
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:47,399
to document everything.

612
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,080
You know, one of the
things that in Aravind

613
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,289
and I's conversations with
CISOs that have been involved

614
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,703
with things is,

615
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,580
they find themselves in litigation or

616
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,439
find themselves testifying
or answering questions.

617
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,270
It is really hard to answer,

618
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,720
to remember some of this
stuff two or three years

619
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,370
after the fact.

620
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,050
And when you're sitting
in front of Congress

621
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,496
or you're sitting in front of
the SEC and you keep saying

622
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:14,437
"I don't remember"

623
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:15,433
"I don't remember"

624
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,202
"I don't remember".

625
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:21,510
It just comes off as lacking credibility.

626
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,670
And I even recommend to people that

627
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,590
as part of this documentation
that they actually

628
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,139
have forms set up as part of

629
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,960
their incident response
plan that they can fill

630
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,320
in these forms as they're
going through these.

631
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,280
And then these become legal
records at that point.

632
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,632
So number one,

633
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:41,330
detection, classification,
escalation, and reporting.

634
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,379
You have to to be able...

635
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,010
You know, I've said this
for a long, long time

636
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,760
the worst time to try
to start figuring some

637
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,390
of this stuff out is during
the middle of an incident.

638
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,827
You have to have this
documented and in place before

639
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:58,100
and this should be part of your

640
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,538
incident response process
that you test, you know

641
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:04,020
multiple times a year.

642
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,030
Number two, building this
incident response team

643
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,060
and the process for minimizing
conflicts of interest.

644
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,679
You know, we saw in a
couple of these cases

645
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:18,570
where people in the company would end up,

646
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,960
they become aware of an incident

647
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,010
and then they sell their stock

648
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,920
before this incident is made public.

649
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,057
Well come on, that's a no brainer.

650
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,660
You're gonna get caught doing that.

651
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,040
So those kind of conflicts of interests

652
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,800
you have to think about
those doctoring that.

653
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,120
Investigating objectives,
the root cause analysis,

654
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,540
remediation, the "Why's" of
all of this that had happened.

655
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,870
And then finally this documentation.

656
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,649
And again, I wish I could
tattoo this on everybody that,

657
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,280
you know, document, document, document

658
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,370
because I guarantee you,

659
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,169
and we talked to a number of people,

660
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,130
trying to remember all of
the things that happened

661
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,490
and all of the steps you took
and all the guidance you gave

662
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,440
and all of the direction
that you proposed.

663
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,960
You're not gonna remember
that two or three years later.

664
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,580
And in one of these cases that takes

665
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,429
two or three years to evolve.

666
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,350
You just simply are not gonna
remember all of those steps.

667
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,013
And those things can end
up costing you money.

668
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,290
- Let me echo what Mark said.

669
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,170
This is so important

670
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,610
it's actually worth repeating, right?

671
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,777
Let me just pick on two things.

672
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,150
Let me pick on escalation reporting

673
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,230
and let me pick on documentation.

674
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,130
So escalation is actually one

675
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,890
of the most crucial areas
that we see individuals fail

676
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,343
and either lose their job or
end up in a bad situation.

677
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:50,980
The criteria for when an
event should be escalated

678
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,530
and to whom it is escalated to, right?

679
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,570
Have to be laid out really
clearly in your plan, right?

680
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,730
And so that there's
objective criteria that says

681
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,510
that as an instant responder

682
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,500
you don't have to ask...

683
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,317
There's a bunch of questions
in the chat, by the way.

684
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:06,600
"What's a breach? Is it this,
is it this, is it this?"

685
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,889
And the answer is you don't
have to worry about that.

686
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,774
Let the knucklehead lawyers like me

687
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:13,949
spend hours and hours trying to figure out

688
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,370
whether it's a breach or not.

689
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,550
What you should have in your plan is

690
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,149
objective criteria that said

691
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,480
if this happened, this is what I'm doing.

692
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,980
If this happened, this is who I'm telling.

693
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,440
If I see potential for personal
information's compromised

694
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,040
I got to call the Chief Privacy Officer.

695
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,510
I got to call the General Counsel.

696
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,900
Whoever it is and whatever
it is, it doesn't matter.

697
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,890
What matters is that you have a plan,

698
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,490
that all of the relevant stakeholders have

699
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,990
signed off on that severity assessment

700
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,950
and escalation matrix.

701
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,890
And they know when they're
going to get the call.

702
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,090
So that when you're in the situation

703
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,280
that the instant responders
at Yahoo! are faced with,

704
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,980
you can say, "Look, I did
what I was supposed to do.

705
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,820
You told me, I'm not a lawyer,

706
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,636
you told me that this is
when you wanted to know,

707
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,070
and I told you. You told me below this

708
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,377
you didn't want to know,
and we didn't tell you."

709
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,379
And so that's a real important thing,

710
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,400
they have to be objective criteria

711
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,310
and a clearly mapped
out escalation process.

712
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,620
Let me talk about,
- And,

713
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,919
- Yeah, go ahead Mark.

714
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,053
- I would just gonna say,
and really important is

715
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:14,207
that you follow that escalation process.

716
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,590
You know, if you skip steps

717
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,980
if you have documented a process and you

718
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,606
skipped steps in that process,

719
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,677
you're putting a gun to
your head because you know,

720
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:27,530
you're gonna be held accountable
for skipping those steps.

721
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,979
- That's a great point, right?

722
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,600
If you say you're gonna
do it, do it. (laughs)

723
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,507
Right?

724
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:34,341
I think that's the really key part.

725
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,320
Don't just have a plan and not follow it.

726
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,060
Let me talk about
documentation for a second.

727
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,399
And let me use Yahoo! as an example.

728
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,870
The breach that they were
investigating was in 2014.

729
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,699
And I will just tell you that the IR team

730
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,579
and the paranoids that were working that,

731
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:56,149
were working 15, 16 hour days for months.

732
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,670
For months.

733
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,800
They couldn't remember

734
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,690
when their kids birthdays were,

735
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,550
much less what happened on any given day.

736
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,062
And here you are two years later,

737
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,163
after you've spent three months
burning the midnight oil.

738
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:16,200
You've forgotten to shower,
you forgot to change,

739
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,820
you forgot to eat lunch.

740
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,730
And now you've got some lawyer in a suit

741
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,770
asking you "What did
you do on a specific day

742
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,262
at a specific time and who did you tell

743
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:26,720
and what did you tell them?"

744
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,850
And you're like, "I don't have a clue!"

745
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,888
Even if you did it yesterday
you might not remember.

746
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:35,010
The documentation piece is to
protect you and the company

747
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,368
so that there's an accurate
record of what happened when.

748
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:41,350
And I'll tell you how bad
it's gotten in some cases.

749
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,520
We actually have a
presentation that turned

750
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,700
out to be the most key
document in the case.

751
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,170
And it was done in Google docs

752
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,320
and what we literally had to do,

753
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,740
'cause there was no record
of who did what, when,

754
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,280
was we had to rebuild it in
Google docs, in an animation.

755
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,160
So you could literally
see every single change

756
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,540
that every single person made to that deck

757
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,810
before it went to the CEO
and the General Counsel.

758
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,470
And that ended up saving
the butts of a number

759
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,996
of people who had put
changes in the deck that said

760
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,860
"No, no, no. It was
exfiltrated, here's what I did

761
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,840
and here's my annotation."

762
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,949
So that will help you remember,

763
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,799
at a minimum, will help
you remember what you did

764
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,199
and when you did it but
it's also the record

765
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,480
of how you followed your
incident response plan and why

766
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,370
what you did is completely defensible.

767
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,839
So in the criminal world
we say it negates intent.

768
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,750
I didn't deceive anybody.

769
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,330
I didn't try to hide
anything from anybody.

770
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,190
Because what I did was
try to tell them exactly

771
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,550
what was going on at the
time it was happening.

772
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,667
So, you know, you'll hear us,

773
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,060
you'll hear lawyers say
document, document, document.

774
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,820
I can't tell you how
important that documentation

775
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,469
has been to our clients
who are in that hot seat

776
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,020
and to be able to go back
and look at an email,

777
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,810
or look at a document
that they put together

778
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,797
or something and be like,

779
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:58,458
"Yes, I now remember I
did that at this time

780
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,257
and said this to this person."

781
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,267
- So Aravind, and this is
a legal question for you

782
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:08,600
that I'm sure somebody
has thought of this,

783
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
but if you can remember, you know,

784
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,116
Alex was long gone from Yahoo!

785
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:16,950
when this incident was being litigated.

786
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,720
And you can, in many cases, you know

787
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,879
two or three years later, you know

788
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,080
people have left and
now you have a challenge

789
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,398
from a discovery process
of even getting access

790
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:33,470
to your notes or your emails

791
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,580
that the company may or
may not even have anymore.

792
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,540
So, Aravind

793
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:40,480
what do you recommend

794
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,930
as CISOs that, how we deal with that,

795
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,430
with this record retention that
you may not have access to.

796
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,109
- It's a really, really good question.

797
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,860
And it's actually a
fantastic question, Mark.

798
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,840
And here's the way to address it,

799
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,300
is as part of your IR plan,

800
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,260
you should have a section that devotes

801
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,530
to how will you retain records

802
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,124
around this incident when it's over.

803
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:06,292
So, for small incidents you can have

804
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,277
a small entry in the file that says

805
00:36:08,277 --> 00:36:10,220
"This is what we did" in a short memo,

806
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,428
but having a policy of like how we keep

807
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:14,080
records relating to an incident,

808
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,450
how long we will keep them
for, where they are kept,

809
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,960
who is the custodian of those.

810
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,580
So that, Mark, if you
have left the company

811
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,250
and now we're looking at
it sort of hindsight 20/20

812
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,770
and we're looking at it two
or three years down the road,

813
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,530
the company had an obligation
to keep those records

814
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,850
in a certain way, for a
certain period of time.

815
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,370
And then if they didn't keep those

816
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,406
then you have an opportunity to say,

817
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:36,620
"Look, how do you expect
me to remember it?

818
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,750
I built into our plan a way

819
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,210
for me to remember these things, a way

820
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,880
for our team to record what we did.

821
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,120
If you went and blew all that stuff away,

822
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,000
that's now on you."

823
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,300
And so again, that
helps the company though

824
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,460
'cause if you prepared
those and you keep those

825
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,550
for a certain prescribed period of time,

826
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,940
and your legal team and your

827
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,560
information governance
team can tell you how long

828
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,860
that needs to be kept for,

829
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,690
that's the best defense Mark, right?

830
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,543
To make sure that those records

831
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:03,460
are gonna be there a year,
two, three years later,

832
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,830
as you know, as the shit's
proverbially hitting the fan.

833
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,910
- Well and you also have...

834
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:14,650
The CISO may find themselves
on the other side of the fence

835
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,262
from the company where the relationship is

836
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:19,913
it's not a gentle relationship.

837
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,460
There's animosity in there,

838
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,690
where the company doesn't want to provide,

839
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,660
doesn't want to have
access to this information

840
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,720
because it could hurt
them in the long run.

841
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,553
- Yeah.

842
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,690
So that's a great point, Mark

843
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,680
that we're going to segue to

844
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,120
when we talk about
individual representation.

845
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,517
So let's take a look at just some

846
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,589
of the things that I think we've

847
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,020
already talked about Mark, a little bit,

848
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,560
which are post incident
work and remediation.

849
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,270
I think we've covered most of these Mark,

850
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,018
but maybe there's something

851
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,383
you want to draw specific attention to.

852
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:54,937
- I think maybe number three, there.

853
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:57,470
One of the things that
we should always be doing

854
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,490
is learning from our processes.

855
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,109
So as you go through an incident, you know

856
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,943
and you document.

857
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,810
Wow, we thought that this person was

858
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,670
going to be communicating
to the shareholders,

859
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,220
but it was actually this person

860
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,330
or we thought this person...

861
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,910
Make sure that you can go back and

862
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,490
do the revisions to your
policies and procedures

863
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,709
that reflect the reality and not

864
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:22,210
the reality that you
thought before an incident.

865
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,728
So, you know, being able to go back

866
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:27,194
and actually build

867
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:31,540
real life into their policies
is really, really important.

868
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,800
- Yep. Totally agree.

869
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,633
Okay.

870
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,910
So let's take a look at, just real quickly

871
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,399
'cause I think we want to
get to some of the meat stuff

872
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,498
that people probably have questions about,

873
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:43,831
about executive and board engagement,

874
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:45,760
Mark, you want to take this one?

875
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,670
- Yeah. I mean, listen
there's nothing earth shaking

876
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,020
in here.

877
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,990
You know, pre-incident making sure,

878
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,319
this should be something
that you have a discussion

879
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,170
with your board about every
quarterly board meeting.

880
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,350
You're basically updating
them on the risk factors

881
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,770
on incidents that they
should be knowing about.

882
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,569
I've always had kind of
a, or I've tried to have

883
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:12,340
more of an open communication policy

884
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,830
with my boards where I could
even go, you know, mid-quarter

885
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,190
you know, out of cycle
of the board meetings.

886
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,317
And I could just drop the the
board members notes to say,

887
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,820
"Hey, this thing happened.
It's not a big deal."

888
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,330
Actually I try to stay in front of these

889
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,759
because an incident like
Colonial or an incident like

890
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,310
Solar Winds happens.

891
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,360
And the first thing the
board's doing is calling

892
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,650
the CEO going you know, "WTF,
are we impacted by this?"

893
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,930
So I always recommend having
a good communication strategy

894
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,839
and an open communication strategy

895
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,750
with the board on
pre-incident related things.

896
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,550
And then obviously during an incident,

897
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,040
CEO is typically gonna
be making the calls there

898
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,680
or general counsel are going
to be making the calls on

899
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,190
how you're updating the boards,

900
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,190
how you're you know, you're
trading blackouts and, you know

901
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,890
working with the audit committee.

902
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,819
And typically the CEO

903
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,740
or the GC is kind of honchoing that,

904
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,459
that's gonna be beyond the
CISO's role at that point.

905
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,160
- Yeah. And I think
the key on this is that

906
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,470
doing the pre-incident
things allows you to do

907
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,298
the during incident things.

908
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:22,250
One of the things we hear from CISOs

909
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,083
oftentimes it's like

910
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,750
"I don't understand a lot of that stuff.

911
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,890
That's not my problem, it's not my job

912
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:31,508
to be worried about that.
That's why we have the lawyers."

913
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:32,589
And my response to that is

914
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,100
you need to build a partnership
early with your board,

915
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,110
with your management, with your legal team

916
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,570
so that they can help
you lay the foundation

917
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,990
so that when you're in
front of the board talking

918
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,359
about an important issue,
it's not being discounted.

919
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,620
You're being taken, you know,

920
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,609
directly for what the
words that you have are,

921
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,880
you have access to them.

922
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,260
They know who you are.

923
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,530
So some of the pre
incident stuff helps you do

924
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,817
the post incident or the
during incident stuff.

925
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,145
And I think that's the other
thing highlight out of these is

926
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,305
that these sort of
build off of each other.

927
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:02,819
- You know, and I always tell people,

928
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,140
if you can find a champion,

929
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,915
a security champion on the board,

930
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:10,640
somebody that you can
communicate with, you know,

931
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,259
out of band, between board meetings

932
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,100
that's the best thing 'cause
that champion is gonna

933
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,330
be able to have discussions
with the other board members.

934
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,810
So then you're not,

935
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,029
you don't look like the
Lone Ranger out there

936
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,580
where you're always bringing
bad news to the board.

937
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,610
- Yup. Okay.

938
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,613
So let's talk about the "What
About Me's" a little bit.

939
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,810
So a couple of different things, right?

940
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,779
And so a lot of these come
out of Joe Sullivan's case,

941
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,930
but these aren't unique.

942
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,319
We face these when we represent people

943
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,420
whether it's in Equifax or
when we represent people

944
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,767
in Yahoo!, there's a question
about representation.

945
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,629
"Do I need my own lawyer?"

946
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,140
And largely what we would tell you is

947
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,580
that the company counsel
represents the company,

948
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,000
your individual counsel represents you.

949
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,870
They have your best interests in mind.

950
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,759
Now, does that mean you need
a lawyer for every incident?

951
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,550
No. Does that mean you might
lead a lawyer for an incident?

952
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,920
Yes.

953
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,850
The key to understand is that,

954
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,210
again what Mark and I
lay the groundwork for is

955
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,610
if you're doing what's in
your incident response plan,

956
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,720
if you're following best practices,

957
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,149
largely a lot of these issues
can be avoided altogether.

958
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,410
And so when you're acting in
the company's best interests,

959
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,910
you are actually generally
acting in your own.

960
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,120
And so you don't need a
lawyer every single time

961
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,759
there's an incident, but
there are times that you do.

962
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,640
And here's the reason, right?

963
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,040
Because the privilege, the legal advice,

964
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,630
that's for the company,
that's not for you.

965
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,450
They don't represent you.

966
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,140
You don't actually maintain the privilege

967
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,060
over those conversations.

968
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,340
They can waive it at any time.

969
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,890
And so you may need
your own lawyer, right?

970
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,690
The question is, "When
do I need my own lawyer?"

971
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,680
And the answer is at the
moment when you suspect

972
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,629
that your interests and
the company's interests

973
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,130
are diverging is the time you
need to begin thinking about

974
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,548
that question.

975
00:43:00,548 --> 00:43:04,158
And there are a small group
of professionals out there

976
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:06,719
who have represented individuals

977
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,600
in the context of an ongoing event,

978
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,493
in the aftermath of an ongoing event.

979
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:13,980
And what it's important to know is

980
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,680
you should be understanding
who those folks are.

981
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
Now, we're going to talk
about another reason

982
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,650
you need legal counsel

983
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,750
in the application process for your job.

984
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,310
And so you may already have a lawyer,

985
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,230
that you can consult with.

986
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,980
But I think the key is that, you know

987
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,840
the privilege doesn't apply to you,

988
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,260
that you may need to select
your own individual counsel.

989
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,570
Now, how does that work?

990
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,670
And this is the question
we get all the time.

991
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,823
Okay. Here's how that basically works.

992
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,080
Certain executives

993
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,410
have the right to select legal counsel

994
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,399
by corporate documents, right?

995
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,840
In certain events.

996
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,930
And the company will pay for that,

997
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,055
it's called indemnification.

998
00:43:54,055 --> 00:43:56,602
Where the company says,
for these officers,

999
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:00,899
if someone's seeking to
hold them personally liable

1000
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,430
in connection with certain
events that they've taken,

1001
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,692
within certain confines,

1002
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:07,767
the company will indemnify that

1003
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,919
and they will pay for their legal costs,

1004
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,130
they will pay for their defense,

1005
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,530
they may even pay the fines.

1006
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,440
That's usually found in
corporate charter documents

1007
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,293
like the bylaws.

1008
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,150
And it's most often found for the "C's".

1009
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,840
The C-Suite, the CEO,
the CFO, and some others.

1010
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,817
Here's the key, just because you have a

1011
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:30,520
"C" in front of your name,
doesn't mean you're indemnified.

1012
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,353
- [Mark] Nope.

1013
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:32,270
- That's the thing we hear all the time

1014
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,210
from folks like, "Well, I'm a
'C', I'm a Chief Something."

1015
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,196
Not necessarily under the law.

1016
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:40,640
And so you should understand
when you're thinking

1017
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,600
about a job is whether you have rights

1018
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,930
to be indemnified by the company.

1019
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,790
And I'll talk about indemnification

1020
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,590
in some more detail in a little bit.

1021
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,042
Even if you're indemnified,

1022
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,240
the company may, even if
you're not indemnified,

1023
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,479
the company may advance

1024
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,760
costs or fees to pay for your counsel.

1025
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,810
And you may have rights
to get advancement.

1026
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,343
Whether it's under a contract
or whether it's in the bylaws,

1027
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:04,420
and we'll talk about that in a second.

1028
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,770
But it almost is always accompanied

1029
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,450
by an undertaking to repay, right?

1030
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,870
Which means, yes, the company
will front my legal costs,

1031
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,490
but if it's found that I did
something that is outside

1032
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,629
the indemnification, or the
company is not going to pay for,

1033
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,740
I have to pay the company
back for those legal fees.

1034
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,850
Here's the practical advice,

1035
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,937
I will tell you about this one piece

1036
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:25,797
'cause it comes up all the time.

1037
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:28,531
"Well, what happens when I've gone through

1038
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:31,009
all of this stuff, and
I paid you thousands

1039
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,830
and hundreds of thousands,
and sometimes even

1040
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,830
millions of dollars in legal fees,

1041
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,903
and the company then comes and says

1042
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,069
'you have to repay those.'"

1043
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,780
Generally what Mark and I will tell you

1044
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,707
is if you're at that
point, it's over. Right?

1045
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,600
You've got other problems
that are bigger problems.

1046
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,040
I'm not saying that the repayment

1047
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,149
to your company of legal
fees is not a problem,

1048
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:51,328
it is a problem.

1049
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:54,400
But by that point, there's
usually some final finding

1050
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,340
of liability or guilt.

1051
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,610
That's going to be
actually the bigger problem

1052
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,443
that you have.

1053
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:02,426
It's not the fees that you have to

1054
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,790
pay back to the company.

1055
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,980
- Probably not civil at that point.

1056
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,607
- Right. And a lot of
our clients just say,

1057
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:10,440
"If that is where I end
up, that's where I end up

1058
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,380
and then come chase me for it."

1059
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,980
Right, because I'm going to be
doing five years in a prison

1060
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,760
or I'm gonna have no
money otherwise to pay,

1061
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,640
or I'm gonna have no job

1062
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,250
so they can come squeeze, you know

1063
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,130
try to get blood out of a stone.

1064
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,702
Let's talk about, yeah go ahead Mark.

1065
00:46:24,702 --> 00:46:26,263
- One more thing.

1066
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:28,333
And this has come up a lot,

1067
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,270
is how do you, as a CISO,
when you're negotiating a job,

1068
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,721
how do you bring up
the conversation around

1069
00:46:37,722 --> 00:46:41,100
indemnity and bylaw indemnification

1070
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,446
without looking like, you know

1071
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,982
like you're going to be
a "C" lawyer, you know,

1072
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:50,030
and a problem child
from the very beginning.

1073
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,100
- Right. So it's a great question.

1074
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,490
And here's the advice.

1075
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,332
You can't get it if you don't ask.

1076
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,823
And the reality is,

1077
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,470
more and more Chief
Information Security Officers

1078
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,470
are asking for this, and
it's not unreasonable

1079
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,439
given the use case that we talked about

1080
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,170
given Equifax, given Yahoo!, given Uber.

1081
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,490
And I'm sure there will be more to have

1082
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,997
an upfront conversation and to say,

1083
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:22,997
"Look, I am a Chief
Information Security Officer.

1084
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:28,300
I have serious significant
responsibilities to the company.

1085
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,020
I want to make sure I am doing those

1086
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,140
to the best of the company's interests."

1087
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,279
And I think what that requires is just

1088
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,300
like every other "C" officer

1089
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,478
or "C" executive is to have
rights to indemnification.

1090
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:44,550
And so you can get those in
one of two ways typically,

1091
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,720
one of three ways.

1092
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,230
You can, I get it by operation of law.

1093
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,340
Meaning the statute empowers
you to be indemnified.

1094
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,820
That's rare.

1095
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,005
Most companies incorporate
in Delaware as a

1096
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,750
Chief Information Security Officer

1097
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,130
you're not entitled under
the Delaware law to get it.

1098
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,670
You can get it because the company

1099
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,030
has said it in the bylaws.

1100
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,127
They've said

1101
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:07,680
"Here are the people who
can get indemnification."

1102
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,529
And some of the language
you see here on the slide

1103
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,143
is the kind of language you
might see in the bylaws,

1104
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,160
in terms of what those
indemnification rights will be.

1105
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,560
The other way you can get it,

1106
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,410
is you can get it in a contract.

1107
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,569
So when you sign your
employment agreement,

1108
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,470
or you get your offer letter,

1109
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,169
and you sign it,

1110
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,390
you have indemnification rights there.

1111
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,430
And here's the reason
that we talked about,

1112
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,549
you should be, if you're
taking a significant C-level

1113
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,910
position at a company where
you're a CISO or a CSO, right.

1114
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,830
And you're gonna have potential liability

1115
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,240
these things might happen,

1116
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,089
you should be considering consulting

1117
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,010
with an employment lawyer
to negotiate on your behalf,

1118
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,110
help you negotiate to make the ask

1119
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,630
that Mark had suggested that you make.

1120
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,990
Right? Because again,
you ain't gonna get it

1121
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,259
if you don't ask.

1122
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,580
So bite the bullet and
ask the difficult question

1123
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,990
because you want to know
what you're getting.

1124
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,279
And I can't say that enough,

1125
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
is you gotta ask for it, right?

1126
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,180
Yes, it's uncomfortable.

1127
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,629
And yes, you really want that job.

1128
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,280
But you're showing and demonstrating

1129
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,180
a level of sophistication.

1130
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,180
And you can say, "Look, I
know how these things go.

1131
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,649
I want to be aligned with the company.

1132
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,580
I want to act in the
company's best interest.

1133
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,540
When there's defense,

1134
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,420
I want the company and me to be aligned

1135
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,770
in how we're going to defend the company

1136
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,150
and myself, when all of
these allegations are made.

1137
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,860
And so I think those are
the ideas that we really

1138
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,413
you know, those are the
ideas that have to come

1139
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:29,351
from your mind and then
you just have to ask.

1140
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:30,690
Mark, if you have anything you want to add

1141
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,563
to that idea.

1142
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,413
- No.

1143
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:36,900
You know in my last job, I brought this up

1144
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:41,350
and I was specifically not a

1145
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,940
Chief of anything because
the company did not want me,

1146
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,420
they had a very small executive staff

1147
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,283
to begin with,

1148
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,660
getting to be included in the DNO policy,

1149
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,230
the corporate DNO policy,

1150
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,017
was something I had to
specifically ask and say,

1151
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:04,316
"Listen, this is a requirement

1152
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:07,433
of me to work here, you know,

1153
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:09,810
and I get it,

1154
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,500
you feel like you're being a, you know

1155
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,570
a troublemaker from the very beginning

1156
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,040
by asking these questions.

1157
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,950
But as Aravind said, you know,

1158
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,834
if you don't ask for it
you're not going to get it

1159
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:21,950
and you're setting yourself up for

1160
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,730
incredible problems down the road,

1161
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,143
if you end up in a security incident.

1162
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,813
- Yup.

1163
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,737
So, and I think that's an
important point, right?

1164
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:35,320
The DNO policy is
another way to be covered

1165
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,600
so to speak.

1166
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,410
So that there is money to
pay for your indemnification.

1167
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,450
The worst thing that can happen,

1168
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,430
and we've seen this happen before,

1169
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:47,089
is company says, "Oh yeah,
I'll indemnify that officer.

1170
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,700
Totally no problem."

1171
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,899
And then what happens, the company

1172
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,403
goes belly up and there's no
money to indemnify them at all.

1173
00:50:52,403 --> 00:50:56,017
A DNO policy can help in
some regards in that respect.

1174
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:58,520
And so that's another
reason to get your name

1175
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,718
on the DNO policy or

1176
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:04,332
be one of the directors that
is insured by definition.

1177
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:07,720
- And you know, one other
really quick thing here.

1178
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,890
I just discovered this recently, and it

1179
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,129
probably should have been clearer before,

1180
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:16,460
but DNO typically will have a cap on DNO,

1181
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,610
whether it's 20, 50, a
hundred million dollars

1182
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,709
that's not per officer
or per board member.

1183
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:26,089
That is an aggregation cap.

1184
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,490
So guess who's gonna be at
the bottom of that list.

1185
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,270
It's probably not going to be the CEO

1186
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,120
and probably not going
to be the board members.

1187
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,520
So you have the board members

1188
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,230
and the CEO use up all the legal fees

1189
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,260
in that DNO policy, you're
going to be sitting there

1190
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,443
with nothing and no recourse.

1191
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,609
- Yup.

1192
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,530
Okay, so just to give you a sense

1193
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,493
for what to look for,

1194
00:51:50,493 --> 00:51:52,087
because a lot of clients have asked,

1195
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:53,470
"Well what do I look for?

1196
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,220
'Cause like, can I get
the bylaws and ask?"

1197
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,730
And here's kind of, here's some

1198
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,900
example language that you
might be able to find.

1199
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,107
I just pulled this from,

1200
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:02,090
you can figure out which the company is,

1201
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,240
their indemnification provision.

1202
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,169
Shall indemnify to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL,

1203
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,799
that's the Delaware General Corporate Law,

1204
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,380
as now and hereafter
yada yada yada, right?

1205
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,000
And it's sue or proceeding whether civil,

1206
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,234
criminal, administrative or investigative.

1207
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,790
These are really broad.

1208
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,181
They're saying pretty much anything.

1209
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,006
By virtue of the fact, by reason

1210
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,250
the fact that such a person is a director

1211
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,500
or officer of the corporation
or any predecessor.

1212
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,710
So you have to be an officer defined.

1213
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,530
It's not just because you have the title,

1214
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,690
it's legally defined, right?

1215
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,023
So let me get to one last thing

1216
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:38,230
that people ask about on these issues

1217
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,460
and it's advancement and
undertaking to repay.

1218
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,477
So again, these are in the
bylaws for a specific company,

1219
00:52:43,477 --> 00:52:45,210
you can figure out which one it is.

1220
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,520
But here's what it typically looks like.

1221
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,687
It'll typically say something like

1222
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,759
"Expenses incurred by the person who is

1223
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,450
or was a director by defending in

1224
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,490
one of those shoes

1225
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,729
shall be paid by the
corporation in advance."

1226
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,310
So they're going to hand you
money to hand to your lawyers.

1227
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,650
And I will just tell you that
we know this from experience

1228
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,520
that the bills, when
you're really in the midst

1229
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,130
of these can be in the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

1230
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,050
We've had executives where
the bills are millions

1231
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,130
of dollars.

1232
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,666
Because you're fighting for
your own personal stake, right?

1233
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:18,390
And it's an advance of the
final disposition of suit

1234
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,379
or proceeding provided,

1235
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,760
and this is the undertaking
to repay provision,

1236
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,419
provided that it's made only
upon receipt of an undertaking

1237
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:30,430
by or on behalf of such
persons to repay the amount

1238
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,180
if it's ultimately
determined that such person

1239
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,319
is not entitled to indemnification.

1240
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,283
Again, that's the least of
your problems at that point,

1241
00:53:37,283 --> 00:53:39,310
but you will have to sign an undertaking

1242
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,950
to repay those costs.

1243
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,339
So just to kind of recap the personal side

1244
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,830
really quickly,

1245
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,490
the key things to think about are,

1246
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,560
what do the bylaws say?

1247
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,570
Are you an officer under the bylaws?

1248
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,110
Are you indemnified under the bylaws?

1249
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,230
Will they advance your fees?

1250
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,240
Is there an undertaking to repay?

1251
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,982
And if it's not in the bylaws,
and you're preemployment,

1252
00:54:01,982 --> 00:54:04,067
can I negotiate for it?

1253
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:09,020
Or can I get it in a
renewal of my contract.

1254
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,790
And there are moments
in time to begin to ask

1255
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,320
for some of these things
as a prospective employee

1256
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,740
to the company and companies should

1257
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,970
be in a position of evaluating those

1258
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,256
and considering them in good faith.

1259
00:54:22,257 --> 00:54:24,500
Because it's not that
you are, as Mark said,

1260
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,680
trying to pull yourself
away from the company

1261
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,509
and trying to say like,
I'm going to be nervous

1262
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,280
about this the whole
time, I'm gonna be looking

1263
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,490
to throw somebody else under the bus,

1264
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,089
it's because by doing these things,

1265
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,028
you better align yourselves
with the interest

1266
00:54:35,028 --> 00:54:36,350
of the company.

1267
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,670
So I think, Mark, that's our presentation.

1268
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,900
I think we've got a couple of minutes.

1269
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,036
I think we've answered most
of the questions in the chat.

1270
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:45,010
But if there's other
folks who've got questions

1271
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,090
they can throw them in the chat.

1272
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,210
Or Mark, you got any parting thoughts,

1273
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,512
think now's a good time to do them, right?

1274
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:54,340
- I would just go back and document,

1275
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,483
document, document.

1276
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,770
Make sure that your employment agreement

1277
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,366
at least addresses these things, you know

1278
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:06,438
and you may not get your
company to agree to it.

1279
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:11,438
But you know, I would
at least have to try to

1280
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,180
get this put on ink and
paper at the beginning.

1281
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:18,490
- Yeah.

1282
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,899
And I would agree with
that a hundred percent.

1283
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,100
I think the key is, you're not necessarily

1284
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,325
gonna get this every time.

1285
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:26,694
You may not even want to
ask for it every time.

1286
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:29,170
Although if you don't ask,
you're not gonna get it.

1287
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,290
But I think the key thing is

1288
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,480
we want everyone to think about this.

1289
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,045
So go into that job being informed, right?

1290
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:38,780
The only way you can make a good decision

1291
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,820
about yourself is if you
have all the information.

1292
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,020
And so the goal of this
is not to scare you.

1293
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,853
It's not to say

1294
00:55:44,853 --> 00:55:46,110
"You need to do X, Y or Z",

1295
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,350
it's to arm you with the
information to understand what

1296
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,000
the ramifications should be,
so that you can make a decision

1297
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,312
in the next job I take, in
the job I'm about to take

1298
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:57,009
in building my incident response plan.

1299
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,967
Am I doing all the things
that both protect my employer

1300
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:01,433
and myself?

1301
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,103
- Yep.

1302
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,083
- Great.

1303
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,033
- No more questions?

1304
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,860
I can't see the questions.

1305
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,464
- I've seen the questions and
I think the only question is

1306
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:16,529
about the slides being made available.

1307
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,920
You can certainly email Mark or myself

1308
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,607
and we'll be happy to share
a copy of slides with you.

1309
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,040
All right. I think that's a wrap Mark,

1310
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,940
we got done early!

1311
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,967
- It's never happened before.

1312
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:34,580
Of course they've always
been in person before.

1313
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,810
- Well the only thing I can say is Mark

1314
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,796
and I were both remarking how we presented

1315
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:42,399
at RSA last year when we were
in person in San Francisco,

1316
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,145
and so we hope that the
next time we're doing this

1317
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:47,860
we're all in the same
room with you all together

1318
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,120
shaking hands and sharing
a drink with all of you.

1319
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,240
So thanks everybody for listening.

1320
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,821
And we'll talk to you soon.

1321
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:55,821
- Thank you.
