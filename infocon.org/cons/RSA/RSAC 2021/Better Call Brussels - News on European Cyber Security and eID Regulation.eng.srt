1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,900
- Hi everyone, this is Kim Nguyen.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,880
I'm most honored

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,090
to be able to present
at RSA Conference 2021,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,080
in this virtual experience.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,170
As I said, I'm Kim Nguyen,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm the managing director of D-Trust,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,070
which is a company of the
German Bundesdruckerei Group.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,950
And I'm head of the CA business there,

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,770
and I'm also a board member of TeleTrusT,

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,480
which is the German IT
Security Association.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,630
And I'd like to welcome you very much

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,939
to this presentation on
Better Call Brussels,

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,693
News on European Cyber
Security and eID Regulation.

14
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:40,087
And off course, those of you who have seen

15
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,130
"Better Call Saul",

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,510
they probably recognize the slogan here.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,510
So of course, Saul Goodwin,
he is the lawyer to trust

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,960
and we are speaking a lot of trust here.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,310
So better get to the source of information

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,820
and better call Brussels

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,600
and see about new developments in Europe.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,783
And this is the landscape I'm
gonna present to you today.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,990
So I'm basically focusing my talk

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,009
on the topic of trust services

25
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,260
and electronic identification.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,800
And this is what the eIDAS Regulation

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,100
is actually focusing about.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,539
I've been speaking about
this some years ago

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,410
and a lot has happened since then.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,899
So this will be the focus point

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,810
but the landscape is much broader.

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,810
So actually, I'm gonna go
through other regulations first.

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,731
Let's start with the Cybersecurity Act.

34
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,619
I'll also action on the NIS regulation,

35
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,960
and I will also touch

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,619
on the Digital Service
Act, which is called DSA.

37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,220
And of course, privacy
is always a big topic

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,340
and you all will also know

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,040
the data regulation topics in Europe

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,963
but this will not be the main
focus of this talk today.

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,410
So this is a virtual experience

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,792
but still feel free to use the chat.

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,820
So I will try to incorporate
whatever questions I see

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,630
either at the end of the presentation

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,049
or in between in the chat, what I see fit.

46
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,050
So please feel free to make use
of this as much as you like.

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,270
Okay, so let's start this little walk

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,030
in the regulatory landscape of the EU

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,110
and let's start with the so-called NIS,

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,850
which is short for the
European Union Network

51
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,632
and Information Security Directive.

52
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,170
So what are the main topics
we are gonna cover here?

53
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,820
But in fact, of course, cybersecurity

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,030
is a big topic right now,

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,710
that's not a big surprise for
anyone attending an RSA talk.

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,350
But it's more interesting to note here

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,049
that of course, Europe, it's
a heterogeneous landscape.

58
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,580
So it's clear that the NIS,

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,820
in the version 2.0 that we see here,

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,510
it's really aimed at improving
cybersecurity capabilities

61
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,109
at the national level.

62
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,330
So national level means each country

63
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,330
has to imply its national
cybersecurity strategy,

64
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,410
it has also to implement a
cybersecurity authority here.

65
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,040
And the NIS is actually the framework

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,970
under which this is gonna happen.

67
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
And of course so much
comes from corporations.

68
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,660
So another focus point here

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,190
is really increase the cooperation

70
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,829
between member states at the union level.

71
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,350
So basically, there is a
lot of toing and froing

72
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,760
in Brussels here on how
to move things forward

73
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,519
and how to really improve cyber resilience

74
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,350
of public and private entities.

75
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,519
And of course, resilience
very fittingly the motto

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
for RSA 2021.

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
So improving cyber resilience,

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,060
both in the public and the private sector,

79
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,900
really is at the core of NIS.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,710
And in fact, there are
seven specific sectors

81
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,290
and there are three digital services

82
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,882
that are addressed here.

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,692
Okay, moving on from NIS.

84
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,403
DSA is the next thing,
Digital Service Act.

85
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,423
So what is this about?

86
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,060
Interestingly enough, I
think it's interesting to see

87
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,089
that the commission is actually
moving forward now more

88
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,750
in a ecosystem view.

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,343
So basically, what the
Digital Service Act is about.

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,599
Yeah, it's really the question,

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,200
how can you make the
European common market

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,460
a more safer and more cyber secure place?

93
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,293
So basically,

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,630
countering illegal goods,
services, or content

95
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,200
in online services is one of
the main focus points here.

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,620
So there is obligation on
traceability of business users

97
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,870
in online marketplaces,
very distinct topic.

98
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,880
And of course this has
a very close connection

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,082
to identification, which we'll
come to in a few minutes.

100
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,600
Basically, the focus here

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,810
is also to really safeguard the user,

102
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,230
to put in place effective
safeguards for the users,

103
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,420
including the possibility
to challenge the content

104
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,763
and some decisions that
the platform can make.

105
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,960
And of course, speaking of platforms,

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,007
it's really important that under the DSA,

107
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:26,760
there are certain transparency
requirements you have to meet

108
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,883
if you offer an online platform.

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,610
And basically, securing platforms

110
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,453
is one thing,

111
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,010
certification and audit is the other.

112
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,690
So basically, for large platforms,
there was the obligation

113
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,870
to prevent misuse of the systems

114
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,990
by actually implementing risk-based action

115
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,250
and also by implementing
independent audits.

116
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,220
So the auditing, of course,
here is a very important scheme

117
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,180
to have like third parties
into secure the security

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,930
and the resilience of the platform.

119
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,480
And it's also important,
under an open data aspect,

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,690
that key data of the largest platforms

121
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,170
has to be accessible for research topics,

122
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,510
of course, taking privacy
into consideration,

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,320
but access for research
topics is quite important.

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,730
And of course, in the end,

125
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,970
there needs to be some oversight structure

126
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,053
to really address this complexity.

127
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,990
So where are we in this process?

128
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,400
Well, basically, the discussions

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,989
to find a common position
on all this have started

130
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,900
on council level in Brussels.

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,409
And of course, given the
complexity of what we see,

132
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,110
it's still a process
that will take some time

133
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,610
until we see the first things.

134
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,640
Okay, so having approached
the digital services,

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,070
we are gonna move on to the so-called DMA,

136
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,467
the Digital Market Act.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,030
And here we are.

138
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,619
So basically, this is, again, a very much

139
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,910
ecosystem-focused approach.

140
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,997
And the basic notion
here is that they speak

141
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:11,130
about the so-called gatekeeper platform.

142
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,980
So basically, this is a
platform that allows users

143
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,010
to access certain services.

144
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,090
And basically, so there
are some obligations

145
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,263
that these gatekeeper
platforms have to adhere to.

146
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:32,130
And I'm gonna go through
this step-by-step.

147
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,610
So basically, the first thing
is about interoperability.

148
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,940
So basically, a gatekeeper platform

149
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,469
has to allow third
parties to inter operate

150
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,600
with the gatekeeper's own services.

151
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,010
And also, this is actually
interesting and important

152
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,409
because it means you have to
open up in certain situations

153
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,233
at least for specific situations.

154
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,789
Secondly, the business users

155
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,200
have to be allowed

156
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,070
to access the data that they generate

157
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,010
in their use of the gatekeeper's platform.

158
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,870
So again, this is more or
less an open-data approach,

159
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,460
which means we are talking

160
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,143
about more or less
open-ecosystem approach.

161
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,160
And finally, the third requirement
that gatekeeper platforms

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,719
have to adhere to is they
have to provide tools

163
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,210
to the companies necessary for advertisers

164
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,570
to carry out independent
verification of the advertisements.

165
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,310
So this is, again, important,

166
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,000
but I think once more it
emphasizes the open-data approach,

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
in the sense that there has
to be independent access,

168
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,809
independent verification

169
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,803
of what the platform is actually doing.

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,660
So this is the requirement side.

171
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,180
Of course, regulations always deal

172
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,569
with things you are not allowed to do.

173
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,530
So here are the main three topics

174
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,449
that the gatekeeper platform
is no longer allowed to do.

175
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,050
So basically, the first
thing is more or less

176
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,880
about just treatment, so to speak.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,420
So treat services and products

178
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,120
offered by the gatekeeper itself

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,540
are not allowed to be treated
in a more favorably way.

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,180
So this is really an equal offerings

181
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,872
of all services in the platform.

182
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:19,428
And secondly,

183
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,520
the platform is no longer
allowed to prevent customers

184
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,189
for linking up to business
outside of their platforms.

185
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,640
Again, I think it's important to see here

186
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,033
that the notion of the
common market is an open one.

187
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,339
So basically, the big platforms

188
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,480
operating in this have to really open up

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,923
for third-party business.

190
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,270
And finally, also the platforms
may no longer prevent users

191
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,780
from uninstalling any
pre-installed software or app

192
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,339
if they wish so.

193
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,173
So basically,

194
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,820
this means, again, we are speaking

195
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,223
about an open platform, open
services, open tool chains,

196
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,050
and this really emphasizes

197
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,800
something that the European Commission

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,819
has been very strong about
and they really wanna focus

199
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,110
on open and interoperable platforms,

200
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,090
that leave the decision
for services and tools

201
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,880
with the user at the end.

202
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,450
So again, this is a quite new regulation

203
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,140
and I think it's of special
interest, of course, speaking

204
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,840
at a U.S. conference because we all know

205
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,030
that some of the big platforms

206
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,329
have U.S. origin,

207
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,620
and of course, it's gonna
be interesting to see

208
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,790
how this is, in the end,

209
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,829
going to tie up with what the commission

210
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,373
is proposing right now.

211
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,460
Okay, having said that,
in the beginning I said

212
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,650
I'm gonna focus on the eIDAS regulation

213
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,253
on the topic of E identification.

214
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:57,253
And this is really the next
big topic I'm gonna introduce.

215
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,480
So this is more or less the
timeline that we've seen.

216
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,823
So we are not speaking
about a new regulation.

217
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,520
Initially, the eIDAS regulation

218
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,460
was adopted in April, 2014,

219
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,193
so quite some years to go.

220
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,380
Coming from Germany, of
course it's interesting to see

221
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,080
how is this gonna play out

222
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,600
in the national situation

223
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,183
basically, things came
into force in July, 2014.

224
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,333
And then there was a period
of adoption, so to speak.

225
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,570
And of course in the years to
follow, a lot has happened.

226
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,280
An interesting cornerstone
was summer last year,

227
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,270
summer 2020,

228
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,990
not only because Germany,

229
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,950
in fact, took over the
EU council presidency,

230
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,570
but also in the process of
a regulation in Brussels,

231
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,190
there's always a mandatory
evaluation of the regulation,

232
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,210
and this coincided, in
fact, with the German

233
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,573
EU council presidency.

234
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,820
So basically in the last

235
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,560
second half of 2020,

236
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,512
a lot of discussions went on.

237
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,210
It's also interesting to note
that this is an open process.

238
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,840
So it's a public consultation.

239
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,380
So public consultation requests

240
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,439
were given out for various topics,

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,440
and were then consolidated
by the end of 2020.

242
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,270
And we are now expecting
an effective proposal

243
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,920
of what the revision of the
eIDAS regulation will look like.

244
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,183
And this is most likely to
happen in the next quarter.

245
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,020
And it's gonna be handed
over from the commission,

246
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,153
then to the European
parliament and member states.

247
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,060
Interestingly enough, as you can see,

248
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,000
the eIDAS regulation
has a quite long history

249
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:59,910
and it has always been speaking

250
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,730
about electronic IDs and
also other trust services.

251
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,583
So the AUDS is short for
authentication and signature.

252
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,070
And of course, coming from
CA business authentication

253
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,540
and signatures at the core
of our business portfolio,

254
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,010
but, in fact, our mother
company, Bundesdruckerei,

255
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,360
which is the German federal print,

256
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,120
is also issuing the passports and ID cards

257
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,113
for Germany.

258
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:29,670
So of course the topic of
electronic identification

259
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,810
is also at the heart of our
company group portfolio.

260
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,819
And so of course, we are delighted to note

261
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,490
that finally, the topic
of digital identity

262
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,400
really has entered the political debate.

263
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,890
And I have given you two quotes here,

264
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,600
both from very prominent
ladies in European politics.

265
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,560
On the right-hand side,

266
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,170
you see our German
Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel.

267
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,329
And on the left-hand side,

268
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,371
you see the EU Commission
President, Ursula von der Leyen.

269
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,650
And I'm gonna start,
actually, with Mrs. Merkel.

270
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,300
And the quote that she gave
in the European parliament

271
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,199
when addressing the parliament

272
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,750
at the beginning of the
German council presidency.

273
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,640
And basically, she stated
here that the issue

274
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,610
of digital identity will
play a central role.

275
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,520
And if we don't get this
right across Europe,

276
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,560
we'll have a fragmented single market.

277
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,380
And of course, this is
something that we have seen

278
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,480
for a while in Germany

279
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,628
that Europe has this
fragmented single market

280
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:29,960
that we want to have a
much more interoperable

281
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
and open situation.

282
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,670
So identity is a central role here.

283
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,490
And coming to the commission,

284
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,250
here's a quote from Ursula von der Leyen.

285
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,620
In fact, from the state
of the union address

286
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,130
in September last year.

287
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,030
Every time an app or website asked us

288
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,699
to create a new digital identity

289
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,370
or to easily log on via a big platform,

290
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,760
we have no idea what happens
to our data in reality.

291
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,540
This is why the commissioner
will soon propose

292
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,910
a secure European E-identity.

293
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,219
And so we see that identity is a big topic

294
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,860
and it's a topic on the regulatory level,

295
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,830
and it's a topic that has
really reached the core

296
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,890
of Brussels initiatives.

297
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,500
And basically, what is the roadmap

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,860
that we see before us here?

299
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,990
Basically, there are three options

300
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,410
that the commission is
proposing to follow up.

301
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,410
So option one is really
improving what is already there.

302
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,540
So improving the coherence
of the whole scheme,

303
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,810
the consistency of the regulation,

304
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,829
and of the interoperability
of existing services

305
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,870
of new ones.

306
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,100
So basically, this is a
little bit make better

307
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,670
what's already good and working.

308
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,900
The option two is basically extend

309
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,260
what we have done in the public sector

310
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,400
to the private sector.

311
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,627
And because the whole eIDAS scheme,

312
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:53,430
with respect to identity. it really comes

313
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,560
from the public sector
and for public services.

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,380
And so the second option
here really is extend

315
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,090
the toolbox that we have
to the private sector.

316
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,500
And thirdly, this is what president

317
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,700
from the line really mentioned here.

318
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,420
Built an introduced the European
Digital Identity scheme,

319
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,390
which is more or less unified

320
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,740
and incorporating all the
different national E-ID schemes.

321
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,060
So basically, are recommendations

322
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,410
and also, what the new regulation

323
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,973
will probably be frame out.

324
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,363
So basically, as we see,

325
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,980
there are national identities

326
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,800
there are national E-ID schemes,

327
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
and these, of course,
will be the foundation

328
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,150
for the European digital identity.

329
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,920
So what we are probably not seeing

330
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,140
is a unified technology specification,

331
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,319
but we rather see a
scheme of interoperability

332
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,977
between different existing
national E-ID schemes.

333
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,110
And the second question

334
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,140
really is how can we implement this?

335
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,590
And of course, we know that
Europe has a strong tradition

336
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,633
of coming from the smart card,

337
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,349
things of course see that
most European countries

338
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,899
have already introduced
card-based identification.

339
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,329
But of course we know

340
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,970
that the future lies with mobile devices.

341
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,390
So basically, the second pillar here

342
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,150
is really to tie this identity

343
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,910
to secure elements on mobile devices

344
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,350
as a security anchor from
mobile digital identity.

345
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,540
Because in the end, of course, we know

346
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,870
that most people are growing up now,

347
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,399
accept services to work
with mobile devices

348
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,193
and to accept platforms,
to accept mobile devices.

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,270
And thirdly, the question
is, how has the whole

350
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,680
trust service business gonna evolve,

351
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,560
especially when it comes to our entities.

352
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,310
And of course, we see that
the classical identity,

353
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,889
which is more or less
based on certificates

354
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,220
or PKI based mechanisms,

355
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,370
this is gonna evolve further,

356
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,570
both along the lines of
classical cryptography

357
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,740
probably taking into account

358
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,100
things like post-quantum
crypto and other things.

359
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,409
But of course, there are
also SSI based technologies

360
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,260
and this also will be incorporated.

361
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,920
And all this different aspects

362
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,200
in the end will then cumulate

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,260
in what will be the new

364
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,883
second version of the eIDAS regulation.

365
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,090
Okay, looking a little more in detail.

366
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,209
So what is the outcome

367
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,430
of what we've seen in the last years

368
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,390
from the eIDAS regulation?

369
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,490
So basically, one of the topics,

370
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,210
of course, is making all
these tools really mandatory

371
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,650
for relevant law, and
not make this a choice,

372
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,180
make it mandatory.

373
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,693
The second is expand the use
cases to the private sector.

374
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,700
There are some success
stories here already.

375
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,190
So probably you heard, if
you are familiar at all

376
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,450
with some financial transactions
in the European context,

377
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,573
of the so-called Second
Payment Directive, PSD2,

378
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,890
and this is a good example

379
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,500
for making use of eIDAS trust services

380
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,450
to regulate, in this case,
financial transactions.

381
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,950
And in fact,

382
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,230
this is probably a good example

383
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,820
of how private sector can be regulated

384
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,893
using existing eIDAS technologies.

385
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,520
Then we have the topic
of the so-called QWACs,

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,150
qualified website
authentication certificates.

387
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,873
And again, I'm gonna be covering this

388
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:42,140
in a little more detail in a few minutes,

389
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,300
but basically, make this mandatory.

390
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,580
Require sensible sites

391
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,439
to use this enhanced
websites certificates.

392
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,090
And also, ensure that
there is a clear display

393
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,649
of this in the appropriate
browser technologies,

394
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,553
and I'll cover this in a second.

395
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,140
And then there are more
technicalities here

396
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,400
offering the right referencing,

397
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,003
test infrastructure, besides
the production infrastructure.

398
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,899
Make sure that you have the
right technology in place.

399
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,180
So basically, HSMs, high security modules,

400
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,180
and also, the secure elements
will play a big role.

401
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,840
And in the end, there is the concept

402
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,959
of harmonization as always,

403
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,780
always keeping in mind that European

404
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,740
is per se, a heterogeneous structure.

405
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,080
So harmonizing what the
different institutions

406
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,520
within eIDAS are actually doing.

407
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,639
So harmonizing what the
so-called conformity

408
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,430
assessment bodies, the CABs, are doing,

409
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,430
and also harmonize
certification schemes for this.

410
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,870
So basically, this gives you an idea

411
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,510
on the flavor of the different

412
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,280
more detailed topics
that we are covering here

413
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,700
and I would like to
highlight two things here

414
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,533
in special.

415
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,870
So the first thing is QWACs
and the second is mobile ID.

416
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,433
So what are QWACs about?

417
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,300
QWACs is really more or
less the eIDAS version

418
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,230
of the good old EV certificate,

419
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,610
the EV certificate being a certificate

420
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,939
that actually not only tests

421
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,440
the technical control of a website,

422
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,970
but also includes validation

423
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,050
of ownership on a more
organizational level.

424
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,040
And you, of course, will
remember the good old times

425
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,322
when the EV certificate came
as a green bar in the browser.

426
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,730
If you look at current browsers,

427
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,790
you won't find this anymore,
and that's not by chance.

428
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,870
In fact, it has been a
policy within browsers

429
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,669
to actually invalidate
this positive indicators

430
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,280
and basically switch
all certificates types

431
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,033
to the same view in the visualization.

432
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,600
There are arguments for
this in terms of complexity

433
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,530
but of course, there are
arguments against this.

434
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,200
And I think from the
European point of view,

435
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,750
the arguments against this
really carry much more weight.

436
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,620
So we feel very strongly that
this is actually weakening

437
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,310
the positioning of the
responsible customer,

438
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,310
in the sense that it's not easy for him

439
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,419
or actually not possible to
distinguish various types

440
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,220
and to distinguish the trust levels.

441
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,950
And of course, it's weakening

442
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,653
this high-end certificate
range, so to speak,

443
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,610
because in the end,

444
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,310
a domain validated certificate

445
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,520
will not use a different
indication for users,

446
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,620
as compared to a certificate
where organizational attributes

447
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,683
are in fact validated.

448
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,640
And so this, of course,
also implements hindrance

449
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,790
for the usage of qualified
website certificates

450
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,623
for website authentication.

451
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:04,340
And basically, this
means as long as browsers

452
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,455
keep on doing this, there is a restriction

453
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:09,250
that is applied to European standards.

454
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,370
And it means, basically,
that over 500 million users

455
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,020
are really excluded

456
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,123
from the usage of qualified
websites certificates.

457
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,780
And we strongly feel that this is a topic

458
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,990
that should be discussed much more.

459
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,800
And we still have the feeling
that that is also an area

460
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,567
where regulation is probably called for.

461
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,253
Now, coming to the mobile ecosystem,

462
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,570
actually, a lot has happened
in the last years in Germany.

463
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,870
And I'm gonna focus a little bit on this.

464
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,209
Right now, in this year,

465
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,680
we see that the German ID card,

466
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,793
in fact will come to the mobile phone.

467
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,640
Bundesdruckerei has been
leading a research project

468
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
which is called Optimos on this.

469
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,652
And this is actually gonna
go to production this year.

470
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,710
And the special key means
that you are allowed

471
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,970
to transfer the identification attributes

472
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,110
from your drone ID card,
one to a secure element

473
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,699
and later make use of
the various use cases

474
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,080
of secure mobile
authentication registration

475
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,460
just by using the mobile phone.

476
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,140
And you'll see a bunch of
different use cases here.

477
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,863
Of course, eGovernment is a big topic.

478
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,690
Hotel registration,

479
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,040
if it's gonna happen
again after the pandemic,

480
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,780
has really eased as a thing.

481
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,639
Public transport, of course,
is always a big topic

482
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,473
in Europe.

483
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:44,660
And there are other
things like car sharing,

484
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,640
mobile contracting,

485
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,410
that all request for easy

486
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,350
and secure identification.

487
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,020
And we really feel

488
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,455
that bringing the government
ID onto the secure element

489
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:03,047
of a mobile phone is gonna help
to move this forward a lot.

490
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,080
And basically,

491
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,409
this is the setup of the project

492
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,700
that was funded by the
German Federal Ministry

493
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,533
of Economic Affairs and
Energy for three years.

494
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,179
So we were lucky enough to be the manager

495
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,600
of the consortium here,

496
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,370
but of course, you see a lot of names

497
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,610
that you probably recognized
also on international level

498
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,233
like Samsung, or Infineon,

499
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,610
or NXP, or Telefonica,

500
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,189
or Deutsche Telekom.

501
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,540
But of course, you see
also some local players

502
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,449
like universities,

503
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,653
which is the suitable setup
for such a project, really.

504
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,710
Okay, so what was the goal
of what we are doing here

505
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,650
and what is going to production now?

506
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,910
So basically, the strategic goals,

507
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,810
really, were to supply some
technology for eID provisioning

508
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,070
and to enable them to
offer mobile eID services

509
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,520
at the eIDAS level substantial or high.

510
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,540
So basically, eIDAS comes
with three flavors of levels.

511
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,450
So there is a low level
which is more or less

512
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,810
just a password-based thing
or something like this.

513
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,240
And then there are substantial or high.

514
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,720
And high, really, is the
highest level that comes

515
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,150
from an official document.

516
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,420
And substantial is probably the level

517
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,060
where the game is really won.

518
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,290
And this is where secure element based

519
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,510
or any type of mobile
technology base at entity

520
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,343
is gonna play.

521
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,340
So the second goal was really
to offer service providers

522
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,280
relying on a certain security level

523
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,240
a secure, privacy-friendly
platform for mobile services.

524
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,160
So this is basically what's being set up

525
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,300
and it's gonna be in
production later this year.

526
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,383
And finally, of course,

527
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,060
goal of the project as well

528
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,629
was to offer the entry for
small-medium enterprises

529
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,840
and startups by setting
up the right framework

530
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,490
of technical and
organizational provisions.

531
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,080
So of course, SMEs always
being very much in the focus

532
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,270
both of the German government

533
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,730
but also of the commission in Brussels.

534
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,380
And interestingly enough,
of course, this technology

535
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,100
that we are deploying
here can also be twinned

536
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,780
with self-sovereign identity.

537
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,680
So it can also work in the
context of SSI schemes.

538
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,170
And basically, the graphic here
shows how the interrelation

539
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,240
of this can work.

540
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,170
So basically, there's gonna be an issuer

541
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,500
who either gives a digital identity

542
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,620
to the holder who can
then store it in a wallet

543
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,330
on this mobile phone, either
using the Optimos technology

544
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,990
or some SSI things.

545
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,410
And of course, when you wanna
use this, you can deliver

546
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,660
some proof of some
attributes or your identity

547
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,352
to verify who's gonna use
this in some use cases

548
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:55,830
that is identity related.

549
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,080
And of course, so this can work

550
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,790
either on the mobile phone
itself, or it can also work

551
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,100
with some decentralized
ledger technology things,

552
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,790
where basically due to privacy reasons

553
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,399
and not the personal data,

554
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,330
but some credentials related
to this would be stored.

555
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,710
And so this is basically
a set up of an ecosystem

556
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,070
that will come to life later this year.

557
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,620
And it's actually under close attention

558
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,469
from the government itself right now.

559
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,380
Okay, so looking at the time,
I'm already coming to the end.

560
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,413
So what are the main takeaways

561
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:32,660
that I would like to propose to you?

562
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,430
So the one thing is that of course

563
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,562
modern mobile phones are equipped

564
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:40,780
with the right hardware security gadgets

565
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,600
to make sure that this can be used

566
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,889
in a secure and trustworthy way

567
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,494
to support identification authentication

568
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:49,840
in digital applications.

569
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,870
And we've proven that
successfully in the project.

570
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,100
And of course,

571
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,770
basically, discrimination free access

572
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,110
to hardware security
modules is key to that.

573
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,760
And we really would like to encourage you

574
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,710
to move this forward where possible.

575
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,670
And finally, proving the identity

576
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,650
of a website is actually
an important gadget

577
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,520
in establishing a unified
digital trust space in Europe

578
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,730
and therefore, much more
attention should be paid

579
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,383
to this also on the
platform and browser level.

580
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,293
Okay, summing up,

581
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,370
we see that the commission
is really determined

582
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,899
to make the coming decade
the digital decade of Europe,

583
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,773
aiming at a digital serenity.

584
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,300
And of course, how are they gonna do this?

585
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,990
They are planning to regulate

586
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,320
and push the digital
and data economy forward

587
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,639
and make Europe fit for the digital age.

588
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,183
That is definitely upon us.

589
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,340
So the DMA is really intended to introduce

590
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,368
some ex-ante regulation for
these gatekeepers situations

591
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,899
that are gate keeping the digital economy,

592
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,520
while the Digital Service
Act is really providing you

593
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,300
obligations for service providers

594
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,149
who act in their role
of connecting consumers

595
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,132
with goods, services, and other content.

596
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,160
The NIS, of course, is much more looking

597
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,840
at the infrastructure point of view.

598
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,750
So it's basically gonna
strengthen security requirements

599
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,600
for companies by imposing
a risk-based approach.

600
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,649
And finally, with eIDAS in the revision,

601
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,930
the commission really wants
to establish a clear framework

602
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,280
for digital identities as
a basis for trust basis

603
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
and digital economies.

604
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,653
And of course, for all this, once more,

605
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,610
hardware security modules in
smartphones play a vital role.

606
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,350
And finally, coming back
to this point again,

607
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,659
the use of QWACs really
can strengthen trust

608
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,110
in digital transactions
and prevent misuse.

609
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,419
And for this, I'm at the
end of my presentation.

610
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,790
I would like to thank
you for your attention

611
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,320
and now feel free to
interact both in the chat

612
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,600
and in other ways, I'm open for questions.

613
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,719
Thanks very much for your attention

614
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,320
and just keep in mind better call Brussels

615
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,120
if you wanna make sure that you comply

616
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,743
with the regulations of
the European Commission.

617
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,199
So thanks very much, enjoy the
conference, and all the best.
