1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,710
- All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,570
Hello, all of you folks at RSA Conference.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,240
Welcome, it's so
different to be completely

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,160
virtual this year.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
I think for many of us,
the last large in-person

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,140
physical security conference
was RSA in San Francisco

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,640
February, 2020.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,620
Here we are May, 2021 and still going.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,230
Welcome to three awesome lightning talks.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,790
I am your moderator and host Bryson Bort,

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,560
Founder and CEO of Scythe and
Co-Founder of the ICS Village

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,669
which you can catch us all day today

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,230
and on Thursday with lots of
different events on the agenda.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,139
Our program right now

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,850
From Existential to Reality,

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,780
Three Experts on the Evolution
of Industrial Control

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,900
System Threats.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,780
Sure seems like that is,
that 2021 is the year

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,740
of ICS threats.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,713
First up.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,690
Okay, so we had the
Evolution of ICS Threats by

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,410
Staff Vice President and Group Manager of

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,779
Cyber Security Consultants, Wade.

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,870
Actually, Wade I'm not gonna try

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,489
to pronounce your last name.

26
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,959
I'll just call you Wade.

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,309
Is there a way that I
can get to see Wade here?

28
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,283
There we go.

29
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:13,930
Hey Wade, so first question.

30
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,920
FM Global cyber insurance provider,

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,460
what do you do with ICS security?

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,339
How does this play in?

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,750
- To the commercial property insurance,

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,750
we, industrial control systems
are insurable items, right?

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,990
They are the specialized
hardware and software.

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,589
And so we used to look at those

37
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,100
through traditional perils,
fire flood natural hazards

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,179
but now with people
connecting these devices

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,950
to the different networks,
the internet, cloud,

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,720
we're starting to look at it obviously

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,770
through that cyber peril.

42
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,670
And so it makes sense

43
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,580
because these are multimillion
dollar pieces of equipment

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,840
that could potentially impact
the physical environment.

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,210
So yeah, we have a significant interest

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,863
in those different systems.

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,860
And so I will start getting
into my presentation here.

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,200
So thank you Bryson.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,450
So this is a timely presentation

50
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,380
and as Bryson had mentioned,

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,600
the Colonial Pipeline attack that happened

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,980
a couple of weeks ago.

53
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,269
We also had the Florida
water treatment hack

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,620
which took place earlier in the year.

55
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,350
So, I think the lesson
learned here is that

56
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,160
what we use to consider
hypothetical is actually reality.

57
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,670
So we're starting to see these
industrial control systems

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,619
impact the physical world,

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,920
and through these different cyber events

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,459
that are taking place.

61
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,020
So pretty interesting

62
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,600
and pretty timely for this presentation.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,140
So to provide a little context,

64
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,279
I talked a little bit about it

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,890
but I work for a
commercial property insurer

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,489
and we consider ourselves
loss prevention specialists.

67
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,660
Our motto at FM Global which
is the company I work for

68
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,609
is all losses preventable.

69
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,680
And we have certainly seen that

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,450
through our few years
of looking and focusing

71
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,140
on industrial control
systems and the cyber risk.

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,220
So for the past three
years I just wanted to

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,270
provide a little background here.

74
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,280
For the past three years
we've been assessing

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,180
industrial control systems,

76
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,980
identifying and helping clients
mitigate this cyber risk.

77
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,820
Additionally, as part of my role

78
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,859
we analyze hundreds of ransomware losses

79
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,270
to identify ways for clients
to become more resilient

80
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,920
against these attacks.

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,500
And one of the first
things that we identified

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,760
and you probably already know this,

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,030
is that OT, these OT environments
have not been the target.

84
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,680
Usually IT is the initial target

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,720
for these ransomware attacks.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,820
But for some reason these OT environments

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,220
are being impacted.

88
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,740
And so we asked ourselves,
okay, why is this happening?

89
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,550
And so in order to answer that question

90
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,850
we had to really understand, okay,

91
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,019
how were these attacks taking place?

92
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,880
And they usually follow
this common pattern,

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,600
the cyber kill chain that
we see time and time again

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,690
where the threat actors
gain initial access

95
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,690
either by RDP, exposed to
the internet, maybe fishing,

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,959
they install malware,
compromise credentials,

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,960
escalate their privileges,
move around the network

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
and discover the targets
that they are gonna deploy

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,080
this ransomware towards the
backups systems and data.

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,830
And what we observed was,

101
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,960
this kill chain was very consistent

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,370
across all of these ransomware attacks.

103
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,730
There might be different
ways that they compromised

104
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,313
credentials, but they're
compromising credentials.

105
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,250
So really what we have
observed are changing

106
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,500
the evolution of this is the objectives,

107
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,120
what the bad guys are
trying to accomplish.

108
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,660
So early on, really what
they were trying to do

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,160
is just encrypt those systems and backups.

110
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,600
And that worked for awhile

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,660
but it didn't guarantee that
the organizations would pay.

112
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,630
Because organizations started to build

113
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,100
some resilience against this.

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,010
They started to expect it.

115
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,820
They build playbooks to deal with it,

116
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,440
maybe they enhance their
backup capabilities.

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,250
But really they started
to resist against this.

118
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,900
So the bad guys changed.

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,440
They modified, and they went
to this double extortion

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,430
type attack where not only
did they encrypt systems,

121
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,030
but they exfiltrated data to be used for

122
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,229
maybe releasing IP or
embarrassing the organization.

123
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,720
So, that dual pronged
attack started to work

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,613
and they started to see
more ransoms being paid.

125
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,940
So the bad guys were
accomplishing their objectives.

126
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,023
But in so doing this,

127
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,669
we started to see that like I said,

128
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,740
the attacks were beginning in IT

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,370
but they were having an impact on OT.

130
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,350
And so we believe that
through this process

131
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,600
the bad guys are seeing, okay,

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,573
if we're impacting these OT environments

133
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:04,609
this is having a devastating
effect on these organizations

134
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,490
and the organizations will
absolutely pay this ransom.

135
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,900
Even if they become resilient

136
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,679
against these traditional IT attacks.

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,980
IT organizations can generally wimp along

138
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,410
with IT being impacted.

139
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,973
But if OT is impacted
that's a different story.

140
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,740
So I guess the question
is why is OT impacted

141
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,470
if these attacks are happening within IT?

142
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,100
Well, it's because there
are systems that reside

143
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,630
in the OT side,

144
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,409
that reside in the IT side

145
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,040
that OT is completely dependent on.

146
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,320
So if you look at manufacturing,

147
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,090
they depend on these enterprise
resource planning systems,

148
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,299
ERP systems.

149
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,190
And when you look at these systems

150
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,560
consider them kind of
the logistical brains

151
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,200
of that organization.

152
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,240
This is how they ship and receive,

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,710
this is how they invoice,

154
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,479
this is how they process orders.

155
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,680
So if you take this system down

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,640
it's devastating to the OT environment.

157
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,550
If they can't process these things,

158
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,170
if they don't have that
logistical capability,

159
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,950
then those warehouses start
filling up with product

160
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,729
and they have to shut things down

161
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,300
in order to be able to handle this.

162
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,170
So this ERP system that goes offline,

163
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,710
this is devastating to these organizations

164
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,940
and the bad guys are learning that.

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,040
Also if the organization doesn't have

166
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,420
good security architecture

167
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,370
between the IT environments
and the OT environments,

168
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,440
then it's pretty easy to ransom the HMI's,

169
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,200
the human machine interfaces
that allow the operators to

170
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,510
monitor and control these devices,

171
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,039
the engineering workstations

172
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,830
and any other system that can be ransomed.

173
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,229
If they're ransomed,

174
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,930
the organizations want to
take those systems down,

175
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,020
because they are not sure
what the impacts are gonna be.

176
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,599
And they'd rather just take it down

177
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,700
and then potentially have
some resulting damage.

178
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,880
So again, the threat
actors are seeing this

179
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,770
and they are really starting
to focus their attacks

180
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,219
towards the OT environments.

181
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,200
So, one thing I wanted to share
with you are my experiences

182
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,400
with these different clients
that have this proposed breach

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,650
what are the actions that they take

184
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,239
in order to build some resilience

185
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,200
against these types of attacks?

186
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,289
And the first thing that
organizations generally do

187
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,920
is they appoint an accountable
individual for OT security.

188
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,220
So that's a non-technical solution

189
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,580
but as I talk to more clients I see

190
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,159
they don't have this
accountable individual

191
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,159
and they think, oh, things
are being handled in OT.

192
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,386
They're fine, my responsibility is IT

193
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,319
and that's where I'm gonna focus.

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,360
So if you don't have an
accountable individual,

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,690
your program isn't gonna be driven

196
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,990
towards those environments

197
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,770
and you're not gonna
have resilience for OT.

198
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,230
- Wait, I got to cut you off.

199
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,240
That that is your time.

200
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,030
Folks who wanna hear more
you'll get catch Wade here

201
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,083
at the end for questions.

202
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,480
Next up we have Ben Miller from Dragos,

203
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,780
the Vice President of
Services and Research

204
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,810
and also a personal friend.

205
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,959
How you doing?

206
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,870
- Bryson good to catch up with you.

207
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,720
Thanks for, I thank
RSA for having me today

208
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,410
and really if we could
go to the next slide.

209
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,350
I wanna focus in on my big idea.

210
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,380
What is my big idea?

211
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,493
My big idea,

212
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,170
your five year mission
is to explore strange

213
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,880
not so new technology,
seek out how it works

214
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,883
and understand the facilities.

215
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,250
Let me rewind that

216
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,323
and get you to that conclusion.

217
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,460
One of the foundational aspects at Dragos

218
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,740
from just a belief perspective is,

219
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,833
if Dragos vanishes tomorrow,

220
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,490
did we leave the world a better place

221
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,320
than it was prior to us being here?

222
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,160
And so a large part of that

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,400
is how we give back to the community.

224
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,863
And that is instilled into
one of our annual reports

225
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:09,860
that we've been producing
now for four years

226
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,420
called a year in review.

227
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,430
So that the year in
review publicly available

228
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,175
and it's free, no registration, no spam,

229
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:21,060
nothing, just completely
accessible to the community

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,680
is about 40 some pages this year.

231
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,079
And it's focused on insights into what

232
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,870
our Dragos intelligence team are seeing

233
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,350
from the threat activity groups out there.

234
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,500
Ransomware, Wade touched
on that a little bit

235
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
as well as vulnerabilities.

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,640
As well as boots on the ground feedback

237
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,870
from all of our response
engagements that we've done

238
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,390
over the course of the year,

239
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,390
as well as our assessments and
reviews of our architectures.

240
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,100
And what we identified,

241
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,193
well, I guess to summarize it,

242
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,990
activity groups and threats
they are increasing.

243
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,690
I don't think that's a surprise,

244
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,270
but we've increased to 15 activity groups

245
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,230
that Dragos actively monitors.

246
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,300
And that's not a stagnant thing.

247
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,810
So certainly an activity
group may go dormant

248
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,810
for a period of time.

249
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,989
Maybe we lose visibility
in their operations

250
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,340
or they just hawl operations.

251
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,980
But the trend that we've
seen over the last five years

252
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,630
is for every activity group
that is going dormant,

253
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,410
there are another three activity groups

254
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,350
that are taking its place.

255
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,530
So those are activity
groups are focused on

256
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,680
targeting industrial control systems,

257
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,530
critical infrastructure as
well as they've demonstrated

258
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,000
some sort of capability around that.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,260
Now that hasn't been a large

260
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,599
mover in many industries,

261
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
what has been a large
mover in many industries

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,440
is the ransomware challenge
that Wade brought up

263
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,160
just before me.

264
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,063
And so there is significant,

265
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,653
there's increasingly aspects
of opportunistic attacks

266
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,430
that are occurring on ransomware.

267
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,310
They are impacting generation facilities,

268
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,689
they are impacting manufacturing floors,

269
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,590
and they are largely opportunistic.

270
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,710
However, the ransomware groups

271
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,150
are learning from that as well.

272
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,890
In 2020, we identified
(indistinct) which is a strain

273
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,699
of ransomware that is tailored towards

274
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,450
identifying data historians.

275
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,110
So if you're looking for data

276
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,390
that's really important
from an OT perspective

277
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,750
going out after the historians
which is a log of weeks

278
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,990
to months of data of
the industrial process

279
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,230
and encrypting that, locking it out,

280
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,280
certainly a valid tactic from a ransomware

281
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,189
author's perspective.

282
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,830
And it's also identifying HMI software

283
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,360
that may be commonly deployed.

284
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,840
And so this is really the operators view

285
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,550
into the industrial process

286
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,780
and how they control that,
the human in the loop.

287
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,199
And so if you're looking
at increasing impact

288
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,220
of business operations
going after those systems

289
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,750
if you find yourself in
an industrial environment,

290
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,523
is certainly solid tactics
in order to do that.

291
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,470
Finally, a recommendation.

292
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,400
So I list three recommendations

293
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,209
in the bottom that are very programmatic.

294
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,030
Certainly we need to increase
OT network visibility

295
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,480
which is extremely challenging
when you're walking into

296
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,350
a response scenario and
the only data that you have

297
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,070
are on windows hosts of the memory dumps.

298
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,300
What you are basically presented at

299
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,310
from a forensics perspective
is what's happening now,

300
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,880
not what's happening two days ago,

301
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,060
two weeks ago, two months ago.

302
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,819
So being able to collect those logs,

303
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,810
aggregate them, have network
data also to pivot off of

304
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,390
is extremely critical
in not just protection.

305
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,660
I think we've focused as
a community on protection

306
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,089
for a number of years but
when the protection fails

307
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,170
and you need to detect and respond,

308
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,793
you need proper tools in place to do that.

309
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,610
Crown jewels is extremely,

310
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,240
what Dragos calls crown
jewels which are the

311
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,210
important assets that
influence what a really bad day

312
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,610
at that facility look like,

313
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,870
and then boosting its
response capabilities.

314
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,100
So those are all great programmatic things

315
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
that will increase operating costs.

316
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,960
You are going to need a
capital expense for that.

317
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,080
And ultimately it's not very actionable.

318
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,330
What can you do tomorrow?

319
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,810
What can you do next week
after you're back from RSA?

320
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,609
It comes down to move
out of your comfort zone,

321
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,480
get out of your cubicle or
your home office perhaps

322
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,460
and get to the facilities

323
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:44,660
and move, switch that
hacker mentality button on

324
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,870
and start asking questions.

325
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,560
It can be, I did this 15 years ago,

326
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,160
really challenging walking
into your first generation site

327
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,930
and then asking really dumb questions

328
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,400
to electrical engineers that
are operating the facility

329
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,520
on how this functions.

330
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,939
But if you move it from
understanding of the dataset

331
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,530
of not just the technology,

332
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,829
but how the technology is influencing

333
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:15,160
the physics, the process

334
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,100
and the ultimate outcome

335
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,880
from a business perspective,

336
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,330
the more insights you're going to get.

337
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,150
And the more that you are going
to appreciate the facility,

338
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,720
the more unseeing of engineering mentality

339
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,550
that you are going to grow
and build a partnership

340
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,069
with that local facility.

341
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,660
So that if there is a breach,

342
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,000
you do have the facility
understanding that they have

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,820
somebody that's being
brought into this case

344
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,040
to assist them that
understands their constraints

345
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,630
and what their worries are.

346
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,580
And you're going to be
walking in a spot where

347
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,030
you can better prepare
them on how to respond.

348
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,569
And because if you build that partnership,

349
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,610
all of those recommendations, visibility,

350
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,640
crown jewels, entry response capabilities,

351
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,720
they are going to be
much easier to ascertain

352
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,530
or build by building these partnerships.

353
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,530
So from a key lessons perspective
of how you can action it,

354
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,010
reach out to your local asset owners

355
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,050
or your facilities and
build those partnerships

356
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,849
and truly understand the technology.

357
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,520
- [Bryson] Ben perfect timing.

358
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,930
I was about to set my phaser to stun.

359
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,762
- Thank you.

360
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,600
- Next up we have Kim Zetter.

361
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Kim wrote what I would call,

362
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,439
one of the definitive books
on industrial control system

363
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,950
attacks with detailing
what happened with Stuxnet.

364
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,850
Kim, are you on?

365
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,110
- [Kim] Yes I'm here.

366
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,110
- All right, so Colonial
Pipeline just happened.

367
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,710
Should we have seen this coming?

368
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,540
- [Kim] Yeah, I mean, I
think these kind of attack

369
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,480
even though it wasn't targeted
against Colonial Pipelines

370
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,480
ICS network, you know, it's
been in the sites of attackers

371
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,770
since Stuxnet first
targeted us back in 2007

372
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,950
while publicly it became
information in 2010.

373
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,470
So we're talking a decade

374
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,500
and actually people expected
these kinds of targeted attacks

375
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,040
against industrial control
systems to come much earlier.

376
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,430
And it's really the surprise
that it's taken this long

377
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,262
to get here.

378
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:25,319
But I want to also just say, I mean,

379
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,429
'cause this was targeting the IT network

380
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,140
and not the operational network.

381
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,980
You know, we've had
warnings or wake up calls

382
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,340
as everyone likes to call them.

383
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,743
I can't remember when the slammer worm,

384
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,610
was it the slammer worm

385
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,895
or the blaster worm that
hit the nuclear power plant

386
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,550
I think it was in Ohio.

387
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,490
And that was a case where it was, you know

388
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,550
not targeted at all.

389
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,440
It's just a worm traveling
the way a worm travels

390
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,970
and it infects this nuclear
plant and they have to shut down

391
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,330
just because of regulations
require once they lose

392
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,159
visibility and monitoring capabilities,

393
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,550
they are required to shut down.

394
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,480
And so that resulted
in a loss of operations

395
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,700
but it wasn't like the kind of operation

396
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,126
we're talking about here
which is gas pipeline that is

397
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:13,139
(indistinct) feeding every day activities.

398
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,440
So, but you know, the warnings were there

399
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,680
I mean, around industrial control systems,

400
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,743
it's been in the sights
of attackers for decades.

401
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,780
- Yeah, so that was the
slammer worm in 2003

402
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,910
which got in through a
contractor's computer access

403
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,110
the corporate network.

404
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,860
And then as a worm found its way linked

405
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,793
into the reactors
processing control systems.

406
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,190
- [Kim] Yeah, thanks for those details.

407
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,830
I didn't have them in my mind ready.

408
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,540
- No problem, that's part
of my job to help you.

409
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,920
So tell us a little bit
about the attackers.

410
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,760
What do you think is going on?

411
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,840
What are their motivations?

412
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,393
What can we expect to see next?

413
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,379
- [Kim] I mean, the
motivation with ransomware

414
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,240
is primarily money

415
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
and they've said it themselves.

416
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,510
I think we should take them
at their word in that regard.

417
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,550
Maybe we shouldn't take
their word on anything else,

418
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,280
but yeah, they were going
after the IT network they said

419
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,470
that they target entities
that they know can pay

420
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,680
the kind of ransom that they are seeking.

421
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,090
That's why they don't go
after hospitals, nonprofits,

422
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,270
educational institutions

423
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,560
'cause that's not where the money is.

424
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,240
And so they went after this facility,

425
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,390
they knew everyone is
talking about sort of how

426
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,950
this was a surprise for them.

427
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,850
But they intentionally were
targeting this facility

428
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,080
they just weren't intending
that it was going to take down

429
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,783
the pipeline in doing so.

430
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
But I think that that's
something that everyone has to

431
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,823
sort of take into consideration.

432
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,910
You know, we know that,

433
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,440
stuck that was a very targeted attack

434
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,590
was designed not to
cause collateral damage

435
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,010
but we know that other malicious
actors don't really care

436
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,680
about collateral damage.

437
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,140
And so that's the, you
know, the issues here around

438
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,760
not just sort of protecting
the crown jewels directly,

439
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,983
but as I think it was
Ben was saying earlier.

440
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,580
But really about, you know,
understanding what could be

441
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,949
the cascading effects

442
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,060
from connectivity,

443
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,419
even if they're not targeting it,

444
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,680
even if they're not skilled.

445
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,923
Just their actions can result
in consequences like this.

446
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,020
- Dark side afterward who
were the ransomware developers

447
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,340
which could be different
from the operators

448
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,100
announced that they were
getting out of this game

449
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,760
after this last one.

450
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,334
Do we believe them?

451
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,275
Is this gonna change anything?

452
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,510
- [Kim] No, I think
they're having a laugh.

453
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,950
I think that, yeah.

454
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,990
I mean, I think they got
scared by all of this

455
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,630
and certainly the forums
where they were advertising

456
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,810
for the ransomware as a
service have gotten annoyed

457
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,020
by the attention drawn to them.

458
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,500
So I think, yes, I think
that there will be a period

459
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,500
of going deeper underground,
rebranding, changing names,

460
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,860
maybe even recoding, who knows

461
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,020
but this is such a lucrative activity.

462
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,020
It's hard for me to believe
that anyone would stop for good.

463
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,639
- How do you think that this
is gonna continue to evolve

464
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,770
and or how do you think government

465
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,020
and private industry
needs to evolve with it?

466
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,073
- [Kim] Is it ransomware
specifically or the IT side of it?

467
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:22,210
- I think both are in scope

468
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,140
but certainly, I mean, ransomware against

469
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,300
critical infrastructure is what
has been the biggest concern

470
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,330
at least within the scope
of this conversation.

471
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,449
- [Kim] Well, I mean, I think what Wade

472
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,810
and what Ben were talking about,

473
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,379
I think people need to sort
of rethink their networks

474
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,020
and I mean, this isn't new,
so it feels a little silly

475
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,330
to be talking about, you know,

476
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,179
thinking about the connectivity

477
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,080
between the IT and the OT networks.

478
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,960
This is something that's
been known for a long time.

479
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,880
We saw this back in 1999

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,560
with the Bellingham pipe incidents,

481
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,710
where it wasn't a malicious attack

482
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,480
but it was a cyber incident.

483
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,440
And the investigators found
that there was the connection

484
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,850
between the IT network,
the business network

485
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,362
and the operational network was a porous.

486
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,723
So this isn't anything new to anyone,

487
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,899
but I think that, you
know, what we have sort of

488
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,300
real life attacks then that
served as a wake up call

489
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,129
particularly for the
people who control budgets.

490
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,963
So that's good.

491
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,770
- I know that you had a lot
of really insightful coverage

492
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,090
and analysis as this unfolded.

493
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,350
My understanding is that Colonial Pipeline

494
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,360
took down the pipeline

495
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,530
because they could no
longer track billing.

496
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,399
It wasn't necessarily
that it was connected,

497
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,100
it was just that they couldn't
bill customers anymore.

498
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,620
- [Kim] Yeah, I mean, I
think it was two fold.

499
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,860
I think that there was things,

500
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,729
look, things were moving really fast.

501
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,120
And when you are a victim
of an attack like this

502
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,840
you really don't know what's happening

503
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,673
and it's a Friday, right?

504
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,723
So this is happening on a Friday.

505
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,480
We don't know exactly
what time the attack,

506
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,410
the systems went dark,

507
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,180
but probably in the evening
when everyone has gone home.

508
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,780
So I think that part of it
was a knee-jerk reaction

509
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,960
that we, you know, that often
happens with ransomware.

510
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
I mean, that is the advice, right?

511
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,169
Is the unplugged your systems.

512
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,770
And so I think the problem here was that

513
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,110
they didn't have a plan in place

514
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,723
so that when something happens
the panic response kicked in.

515
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,590
And so if they had a
working strategy in place

516
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,709
for this kind of, you know, scenario,

517
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,920
they'd done tabletop on this,

518
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,030
they might've had a different reaction.

519
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,139
But, so I think part of
it was the panic attack,

520
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,370
panic reaction.

521
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,523
But I think ultimately, you know,

522
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,040
the decision was made for
them once the IT network

523
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,710
or once the IT network was
locked and they couldn't build.

524
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,250
So the pipeline could
continue to distribute fuel

525
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,430
to customers, but there was
no way for Colonial Pipeline

526
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,330
to automatically track
who was getting what

527
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,030
and then automatically build them.

528
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,190
Now they could have done that manually,

529
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,540
but again, only if they
had planned in advance.

530
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,899
- All right, last question.

531
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,323
Why did Colonial Pipeline pay the ransom?

532
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,450
- [Kim] So I think that
there are a number of reasons

533
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,140
why companies will pay the ransom.

534
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,270
Colonial did have backups of its network.

535
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,910
My understanding, it's
reported that they restored

536
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,210
from backups, but backups
don't include everything.

537
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,710
Backups include primarily, you know,

538
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,983
the business critical applications,

539
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,700
systems, things like that.

540
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,080
So there may be things that are on the

541
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,903
business networks side
that didn't get backed up

542
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,700
that they need access to.

543
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,700
It may also be that, you
know, people may have backups

544
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,130
but they haven't actually tested
their restoration process.

545
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,680
And that restoration
recovering from backups

546
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,300
is a very involved, convoluted protocol.

547
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,020
That if you don't actually
do a run through of it

548
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,300
when it actually happens
and you're in panic mode,

549
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,680
having that backup doesn't
really help you that much.

550
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,070
And so it may be that they had paid

551
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,350
because they simply needed
to get those IT systems back

552
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,183
and running.

553
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,760
But ultimately they paid the ransom

554
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,900
and turns out that the decryption tool

555
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,200
didn't work very fast.

556
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,770
So it wasn't helpful anyway

557
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,200
and they had to go restore their backups.

558
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,500
In this case there also
might've been one other reason.

559
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,740
I don't think this was
Colonial Pipeline's reason

560
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,940
but for other victims
it might be a reason.

561
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,320
If they are doing two fold extortion,

562
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,909
they are not just locking up your file

563
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,850
they are also threatening to release

564
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,100
your business data that they've stolen.

565
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,159
And in this case, they stole
about a hundred gigabytes.

566
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,800
If that included sensitive, you know

567
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,127
business communications
or security documents,

568
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,950
then that might've been another reason why

569
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,453
they would have paid the ransom.
