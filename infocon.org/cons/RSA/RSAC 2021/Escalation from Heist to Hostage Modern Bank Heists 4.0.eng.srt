1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,480
- Welcome to RSA Conference 2021,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,890
My God, it's been awhile,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,820
I've attended these things
for the years over two decades

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,670
and I wish I was there in person with you,

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,120
but frankly, I'm not.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,940
So here we sit and I
have some news for you,

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,350
specifically about threats
facing the financial sector.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,010
My name is Tom Kellermann,

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,020
I'm the Head of Cybersecurity
Strategy for VMware

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,450
and I'm also on the board
of the newly created

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,330
Cyber Investigations Advisory Board

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,459
for the United States Secret Service.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,660
This is a presentation
that's based on a report

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,680
that I've written for the past four years,

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,520
entitled Modern Bank Heist,

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,130
and what's most important about
this presentation I think,

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,370
it's the perspective of 126
CISOs from around the world,

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,220
roughly 48% from North America,

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,589
about 34% from Europe and
the remainder from Asia,

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,700
and what's most important here

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,190
is that they're really
expressing their true honesty

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,559
in these interviews vis-a-vis,

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,110
not only what threats they're facing,

24
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,220
what's keeping them up at night

25
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,769
but what their priorities are
gonna be in the coming year.

26
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,700
We all think of the financial sector

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,489
as the most secure sector in
the world from cyber attack,

28
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,410
and it is,

29
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,243
but it's also dealing

30
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:08,500
with the most robust
adversaries in the world

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,890
and the most sophisticated
cyber crime cartels.

32
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,990
Now look, the FBI has
already acknowledged this,

33
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,649
there's been a 400%
increase of cyber attacks,

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,630
and many of these attacks

35
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,119
are targeting payments systems
in the financial sector

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,980
because of the nature of the stimuluses,

37
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,800
as well as the fact that many
people are working from home,

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,119
you have this robust, dark web arms bazaar

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,530
as we've seen over the past eight months

40
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,430
specific to now the development
of zero-day exploit code,

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,400
we're seeing a renaissance in zero-days,

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,490
that's been exploding
for the last eight months

43
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,600
and are being utilized against us.

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,199
We're seeing rogue nation States

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,910
actually develop cyber attack capabilities

46
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,910
and treat their cyber criminals
as patriotic national assets

47
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,670
and using them to offset
economic sanctions

48
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,440
now because of telework,

49
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,840
we're seeing a true failure

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,760
of perimeter defense and encryption

51
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,140
and the lack of visibility
on those end points.

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,450
We also have the phenomenon

53
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,200
that these adversaries know much more

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,230
about the interdependencies
in the financial sector

55
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,690
than they ever have before,

56
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,140
and thus pursue campaigns

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,270
of supply chain attacks or island hopping,

58
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,240
and then you have the nature

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,583
of the cyber crime cartels themselves.

60
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,090
So offense must inform defense,

61
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,380
and frankly, what we need to do here

62
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,730
is really create a
Knight's fork on the board

63
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,399
in order to kill their queen,

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,470
and in order to kill the queen

65
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,030
we need to understand what that queen is,

66
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,630
and from my perspective that queen

67
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,079
is that secondary C2 on a sleep cycle,

68
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,990
how do we make sure that we've eradicated

69
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,770
their footprint and their persistence

70
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,040
within our infrastructures,

71
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,269
as we attempt to defend
against an adversary

72
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,983
who's become a much more punitive?

73
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,710
So there's been a
fundamental restructuring

74
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,230
of cyber crime cartels,

75
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,869
due to the pandemic
traditional crime was hurt,

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,880
they couldn't actually move narcotics,

77
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,130
they couldn't actually
leverage human trafficking

78
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,769
and they had to migrate online,

79
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,130
which really empowered
the cyber crime syndicates

80
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,079
of Eastern Europe,

81
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,530
so not only endow capabilities
like ransomware as a service

82
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,240
but access mining services as
well to traditional criminals

83
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
whereas cyber crime cartels

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
used to be the second class citizens

85
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
to the traditional
organized crime syndicates,

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,190
they themselves are now more
powerful than those entities

87
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,690
because of the trillions of
dollars a year they steal

88
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,903
from the Western world.

89
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,830
So the top types malware
affecting the financial sector,

90
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,940
yes, emotet, yes, that
take down was impressive,

91
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,829
God blessed the Dutch and the coordination

92
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,290
between the Dutch and the
US and technology companies,

93
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,030
allowed to take down emotet

94
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,270
but let's not pretend that emotet is dead,

95
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,360
we will see a resurrection of
emotet in the coming weeks.

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,193
Then you've got valyria,
dridet, qbot, and hancitor,

97
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:38,270
I think dridex and the resurgence
of dridex is interesting.

98
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,330
This was attack code that
I long thought was dead,

99
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,550
that manipulates a misuses as macros,

100
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,100
but I think it's seeing a resurgence

101
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,750
due to the nature of SAS

102
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,400
and SAS being employed
in most corporations

103
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,503
due to the pandemic.

104
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,220
57% noted an increase
in wire transfer fraud,

105
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,170
and that's the frequency
of wire transfer fraud,

106
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,329
not necessarily the amount,

107
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,680
but that's quite significant

108
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,700
but we see the North
Koreans getting in the game,

109
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,320
the Iranians getting in the game

110
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,260
and other organized crime
syndicates beyond the Russians

111
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,829
actually targeting payments systems,

112
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,250
realizing the vulnerabilities of Swift

113
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,900
and the overreliance of
public key infrastructure

114
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,550
for security in that environment.

115
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,120
41% experienced an increase
of brokers account takeover,

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,670
I would've thought this
number will be larger

117
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,270
but it's just the way of the world

118
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,330
and many people are transacting online,

119
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,770
and many of these cyber criminals

120
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,240
are becoming much more
savvy as it relates to

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,740
affecting brokerage fraud

122
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,710
and manipulating financial fraud schemes.

123
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,180
As illustrated by this stunning fact

124
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,010
51% experienced attacks
that were targeting

125
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,460
market strategies or
non-public market information

126
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,030
where you see a persistent presence

127
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,440
on let's say a portfolio managers machine,

128
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,290
or the head of strategy
for the institution,

129
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,500
market strategy for that
institution's computer

130
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,530
has been popped,

131
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,400
and the adversary is
watching what they're doing,

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,419
probably taking major positions

133
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,010
on the international markets,

134
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,500
this type of digital front running

135
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,350
and digital insider trading
is very concerning to me

136
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,160
as the criminals of the world
and these cyber crime cartels

137
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,940
are well aware that
the most valuable asset

138
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,980
of a financial institution
is not actually the capital

139
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,543
but it's the non-public
market information itself.

140
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,430
Now, in this question here,

141
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,770
I said please exclude solar winds,

142
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,190
cause solar winds is the
prototypical island-hop,

143
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,740
I said, excluding the solar winds

144
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,260
how many of you have
seen me obviously attempt

145
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,430
to commandeer your digital infrastructure

146
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,150
and use it for island hopping?

147
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,010
38% noted that they had
seen the adversaries attempt

148
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,060
to commandeer their digital infrastructure

149
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,290
and their digital transformation

150
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,270
and use it to attack their customer sets.

151
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,150
Now this manifests in three ways,

152
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,310
you've got a network-based
on island hopping,

153
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,110
much as we saw with solar winds,

154
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,530
you've got watering hole attacks

155
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,049
that are not limited to the website's

156
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,570
being corrupted and commandeered

157
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,460
but more importantly mobile applications

158
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,440
and payment applications themselves,

159
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,930
and then you've got this
very Russian technique called

160
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,150
reverse business email compromise

161
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,810
where they take over the O365 environment

162
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,150
within that corporation
or financial institution,

163
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,359
and they push phylus malware

164
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,370
against the executives
in the organization,

165
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,330
as well as the board of directors,

166
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,020
specific to previous
conversations that were had,

167
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,380
the way they achieve that as they use

168
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,469
narrow-based machine learning
to understand the syntax

169
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,480
and the communications between those folks

170
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,230
over the past month,

171
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,180
and then they push pylus
malware typically macro-enabled

172
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,730
to target those entities,

173
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,960
so that they can move
further into those ecosystems

174
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,450
and then use those accounts

175
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,349
to target everyone who trusts them.

176
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,250
And this is really the Achilles heel

177
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,280
of the financial sector,

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,780
look, the financial sector is
based on trust and confidence

179
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,070
in the safety and
soundness of your assets,

180
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,903
and for too long,

181
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:49,190
I think there has been this
focus on safety and soundness

182
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,090
and insufficient focus
on trust and confidence

183
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,700
because it's that trust and confidence

184
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,320
that's being used against them,

185
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,280
as we see these attacks leveraging
their own infrastructures

186
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,883
to target their customers
and their employees.

187
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:06,159
Now notably 54% experienced
destructive attack

188
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
but this is 118% increase year over year,

189
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,140
this just demonstrates the punitive nature

190
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,669
and how the heist has
become a hostage situation

191
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,580
where the adversary is
willing to become destructive

192
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,659
in that environment,

193
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,000
whether that's due to geopolitical tension

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,790
or counter incident
response, unbeknownst to me,

195
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,960
but I would say that informs
of destructive attacks

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,390
you've got pure wipers,

197
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,010
you've got distributed denial of services

198
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,640
just to punish the victim,

199
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,360
you've got the repurposing of ransomware

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,990
to be used as wipers much
like NotPetya style attacks,

201
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,180
you've got specific

202
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,620
and very tactical deletion
of critical data and backups,

203
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,720
and then you've got a
hybrid attacks against OT

204
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,320
and infrastructure associated
with those facilities.

205
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,350
Counter incident response

206
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,830
is actually occurring 63% of the time,

207
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,930
they are fighting back
to maintain persistence,

208
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,640
this is no longer your Dillinger Gang,

209
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,349
this is more like the Joker,

210
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,510
they are ensuring that
they maintain persistence,

211
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,830
they are fighting back,

212
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,650
they are leveraging destructive attacks,

213
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,620
they're deleting logs, they're
manipulating timestamps,

214
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,500
and most importantly,
they understand truly

215
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,740
that time is the utmost
important asset and variable

216
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,450
in those transactions and for defense.

217
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,690
41% observed the
manipulation of timestamps,

218
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,690
this is highly problematic,

219
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,230
timestamps were being used

220
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,820
to not only affect how people
responded to incidents,

221
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,219
but in many cases it could be believed

222
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,210
that they were used to
manipulate the value of currency

223
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,270
or the value of a trade.

224
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,510
There're nine manifestations
of counter incident response,

225
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,990
you've got blocking events
from hitting the SIEM,

226
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,020
you've got disabling AMSI
or other security tools,

227
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,410
you've got clearing logs,
manipulating timestamps,

228
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,439
you've got using alternative
authentication material

229
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,830
like pass the hash,

230
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,220
you've got signed binary
proxy execution, like LOLBins,

231
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,410
using legit files to
execute untrusted code,

232
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,290
deploying ransomware, NotPetya style

233
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,640
and deploying wipers,

234
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,930
as final stages of destruction

235
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,459
of where that really
becomes a hostage situation,

236
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,270
and we really need to be very concerned

237
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,390
about those manifestations eight and nine

238
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,420
we don't want it to
escalate to that level.

239
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,780
33% stated that Russia poses
the greatest concern to them,

240
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,860
followed by China, followed
by the American underground,

241
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,280
followed by the North Koreans

242
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
and followed by the Brazilian underground,

243
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,130
and this makes sense,

244
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,600
look, the Russians have
been incredibly active,

245
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,110
the Russian cyber crime cartels

246
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,900
have a pax mafioso with the regime

247
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,360
where they can insulate themselves

248
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,940
and remain untouchable from
Western law enforcement,

249
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,180
as long as they have pay
homage to the regime,

250
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,699
you see collusion in major APT groups,

251
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,250
like 28, 29 and tulip who
actually have cyber criminals

252
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,750
who are members of those groups,

253
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,840
and you have to respect
that you have to respect

254
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,560
not only the sophistication
of the organization

255
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,329
of these Russian speaking adversaries

256
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,270
but more importantly,
the sub-culture itself

257
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,410
and then nature in which
they are studying us,

258
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,219
they're studying us like a chess master,

259
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,880
they understand how we defend,

260
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
how we react when we're being attacked,

261
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,530
and they are manipulating
ourselves in the same vein.

262
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,350
According to the 126
CISOs that were spoken to,

263
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,700
their cybersecurity investment
priorities are the following,

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,550
XDR and the true
manifestation of zero trust,

265
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,000
contextual threat intelligence

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,460
specific the threat actors,
regions and the sector,

267
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,913
workload security and container security.

268
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,660
48% of these financial institutions

269
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,370
were conducting weekly threat haunts

270
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,280
that is dramatically up from last year,

271
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,760
and I'm very happy to see that,

272
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,010
weekly threat hunts I
think are an imperative,

273
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,560
it's still less than 50%,

274
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,000
but obviously not all
institutions are equal

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,410
when they realize that
the brand confidence

276
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,040
and the long-term safety and soundness

277
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,780
and trust and confidence
in their organization

278
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,900
will be based on them eradicating a threat

279
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,533
before it manifests.

280
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,160
Now, those are true wheel of
pain here for defenders okay?

281
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,000
Particularly of a large institution

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,360
that's operating internationally,

283
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,710
you've got a detection challenge

284
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,060
when you're dealing with zero days,

285
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,650
as well as custom malware,

286
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,189
you've got an investigation challenge

287
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,630
where you're not sure how far
they got, how far they went,

288
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,670
and most importantly, how many
C2 on sleep cycle might exist

289
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,219
let's say through steganography
or something else,

290
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,860
you've got an incident response challenge

291
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,470
where basically you
don't want the adversary

292
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,060
to be aware that you're hunting them

293
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,890
or trying to eradicate
them from the systems

294
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,360
because you don't want it to escalate

295
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
to a destructive situation,

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,070
and you don't necessarily
want your infrastructure

297
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,290
targeting your customers or your partners,

298
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,439
and so you must become very
clandestine in how you respond,

299
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,800
you've got a time challenge, right?

300
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,219
You've got to decrease the amount of time

301
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,420
that they can move laterally,

302
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,040
exfiltrate sensitive data

303
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,290
and/or leverage destructive attacks,

304
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,870
and then you've got this
distributed enterprise challenge

305
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,480
where these ones very secure networks

306
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,720
are now distributed due to the pandemic

307
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,523
and due to the nature of telework.

308
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,079
Now look, given the type of
adversary that we're facing,

309
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,330
given the fact that they're
more likely to be punitive

310
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,030
and escalate the situation,

311
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,230
we really do create a new best
practice for threat hunting,

312
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,600
you know, when discussing an intrusion,

313
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,610
set up a secure communications
channel like Signal,

314
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,140
not Slack, not Teams, please,

315
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,860
they are monitoring all of those things,

316
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,930
they are a mission to all of those things,

317
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,060
use something like Signal
or Wickr to communicate

318
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,709
when discussing an intrusion.

319
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,566
Assume that they have a
secondary C2 on a sleep cycle,

320
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,050
just assume it,

321
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,627
the people that are targeting
the banks of the world

322
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:19,829
are the best of the best,

323
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,740
typically they love to deploy a C2,

324
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,710
that has a 12 to 14 day sleep cycle,

325
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,080
many times in steganography,

326
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,640
you've got to combat alert fatigue

327
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,210
cause typically all the bells and whistles

328
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,090
are gonna be going off,

329
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,100
so how are you gonna
baseline your organization

330
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,430
from when these things do manifest?

331
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,699
Do you have the capacity

332
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,260
to detect and respond across workloads?

333
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,710
And have you truly segmented

334
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,800
personal and professional
networks in the home environments

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
of your executives and
even your security teams

336
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,050
as they're attempting to
solve these things remotely?

337
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,709
Now look, I think one of the
biggest challenges we face,

338
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,890
even in the financial sector,

339
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,870
which has the most significant standards

340
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,130
of the world for cybersecurity

341
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,420
whether it's the Monetary
Authority of Singapore

342
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,110
or whether it's the FFIC,

343
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,480
these are the best of standards,

344
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,760
sorting information, security and cyber.

345
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,593
But that being said

346
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,729
they're very much based on a fortification

347
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,520
and I would attest to the fact

348
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,470
that we have to change the
way we think about this,

349
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,600
the goal of the adversary is
to conduct a hostage situation,

350
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,309
the goal of the adversary is to use

351
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,400
the infrastructure of the institution

352
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,600
to target their constituencies, period.

353
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,530
So I think we really
need to begin to develop

354
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,209
something that looks a lot
more like a supermax prison,

355
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,170
which exists here in
Colorado where I live,

356
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,610
much like that, of the supermax

357
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,150
the original supermax and
that of the perfect castle,

358
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,100
and I say that for the following reasons,

359
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,800
when you think about
the original development

360
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,890
of the supermax prison,

361
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,723
it was developed by

362
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:42,349
not only the best prison
architects in 1991 and 92

363
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,210
but also some very significant
social psychologists

364
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,830
and cognitive psychologists

365
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,440
of which they were
advising these architects

366
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
on the mentality of
the greatest sociopaths

367
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,430
of the megalomaniacs that were locked up

368
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,750
in the worst prisons of the world

369
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,840
and they were discussing
how these criminals

370
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,130
typically took over that
prison from the inside out,

371
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,470
they were running the guards,

372
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,940
they were running criminal conspiracies

373
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,380
and even hits against the outside world

374
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,590
from within the prisons,

375
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,790
and they had to inhibit
that cult of personality

376
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,069
from manifesting within that environment,

377
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,790
that's what we should be trying to achieve

378
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,449
when it relates to dealing
with the cyber criminal

379
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,580
and cyber crime cartel

380
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,010
as they target financial institutions.

381
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,439
Okay, you need to limit and inhibit them

382
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,960
from a resource perspective,

383
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,750
you need to inhibit lateral movement,

384
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,860
you need to make sure you
suppress them in real time,

385
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,280
you need to make sure
that the infrastructure

386
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,560
intrinsically defends itself against them

387
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,739
and that when you hunt them

388
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,010
or when you're responding to them

389
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,450
they are unaware that you were doing so.

390
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,140
So to achieve that, it begins with having

391
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,420
network detection and
response capabilities

392
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,339
but those have to be intertwined
with workload security,

393
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,580
and then as you move further on,

394
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,930
the endpoint protection platform

395
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,270
has to be seamlessly
integrated to both of aspects,

396
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,120
and then finally, the network
segmentation should be dynamic

397
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,230
specific to threats
from either the network

398
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,410
or the end point to that environment,

399
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,569
applying rules like, you know,
zero trust are fundamental

400
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,690
but intrinsically powering them

401
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,540
by integrating these types of capabilities

402
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,750
will be fundamental to your success.

403
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,950
In order to achieve,

404
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,980
you know intrinsic
security and zero trust,

405
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,470
you have to believe on the construct

406
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,120
of intrusion suppression,

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,750
intrusion suppression,
in its very definition

408
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,750
is the construct of can you
detect, deceive, divert, contain

409
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,760
and hunt an adversary,
unbeknownst to an adversary?

410
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,900
And I believe firmly that to achieve that

411
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,600
you need to conduct weekly threat hunts

412
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,640
which really give you a game day film,

413
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,360
you need to integrate
your NDR with your EPP,

414
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,370
you need to audit current systems date,

415
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,740
you need to segment your network,

416
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
and if you can dynamically do so

417
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,390
specific to contextual threat
intelligence, that's powerful,

418
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,110
you need to deploy application control

419
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,610
cause frankly it's really
hard to get underneath that,

420
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,940
you need to apply just
in time administration,

421
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,270
deploy workload security

422
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,520
and use deception technology
where you see attack paths

423
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
that you cannot harden,

424
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,430
so at a minimum you can alert

425
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,979
and respond to the adversary of today.

426
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,290
We just need to remember,

427
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,910
you know the greatest
trick the devil ever pulled

428
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,730
was to convince the world he didn't exist,

429
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,830
and that devil my friends

430
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,770
is somewhere in your infrastructure

431
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,510
and it's your job to it root out,

432
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,330
and all I gotta say is happy hunting,

433
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,550
and thank you for allowing
me to speak to you today,

434
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,847
My name is Tom Kellermann from VMware.
