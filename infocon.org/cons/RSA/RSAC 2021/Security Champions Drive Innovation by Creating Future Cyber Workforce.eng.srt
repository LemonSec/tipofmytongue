1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,950
- Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm Tanvi Bali.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,777
And I'm here to talk about my session,

4
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:08,420
"Security Champions: Driving Innovation

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,800
by Creating Future Cyber Workforce."

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,330
But we are not here to
talk about me today.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,160
We are here to talk about you today.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,980
So let us start with
two important questions,

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,610
before we begin with the
actual session as well.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,000
So my first question is,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,350
whoever is listening to this talk today,

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,790
and as a security professional,

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,699
my question to you is,

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,500
have you ever felt that frustration

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,080
and burnout in the very work that you do?

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,550
Have you felt that you have
too many secure design reviews,

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,720
too many secure coding reviews to handle

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,320
that you can actually handle
in realistic sense as well?

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
Are you truly burnt out?

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
Now, my second question
is for the engineering

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,083
and the DevOps community out there.

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,150
Have you truly felt with your heart

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,720
that security is indeed,

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,510
despite all the automation that we put in,

25
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,330
security team is indeed
a major blocker for you

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,780
and for the business?

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, if the answer to both
these questions have been a yes,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,603
trust me, I have been in
both of these spaces myself,

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,300
before I had a final dream and
a vision to resolve it all.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,683
Now my third question
comes, think about it,

31
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:34,740
what if we had a single silver bullet

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,539
to resolve all these questions in one shot

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,981
with a single strategy.

34
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:42,030
The security teams are not burnt out

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,530
and the DevOps teams
actually think security

36
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,030
is then enabler.

37
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,280
You can add security professionals working

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,780
in the tech teams as well,

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,530
but with the minimum cost
for the business, what if?

40
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,010
What an amazing dream that would be.

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,373
Well, I had that dream and
that vision myself as well.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,410
But it took a lot of number of years

43
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,329
to even get there at the end of the day.

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,330
So now let us start with my journey.

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,500
And my idea today with this session

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,860
is to help you with yours
at the end of the day.

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,613
So let's begin with my journey.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,040
Now I started my career in
2011 and I was a developer,

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,970
and I worked in a really
large tech corporation

50
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,930
as well as a developer.

51
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,030
And everyone who's a developer
on this call understands

52
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,030
we need to do morning deployments,

53
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,910
night deployments, code releases as well.

54
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,329
Now I was sitting in the office
one day, 10:00 pm at night,

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,340
waiting for finally for
my release to go through.

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,650
And two hours before my release,

57
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,960
when I was dreaming about my hot food

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
and my nice bed to go back and sleep,

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,917
there came up security
professional who said to me,

60
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,750
"Tanvi, you have
vulnerabilities in your code

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,510
and you cannot deploy today.

62
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,906
Please come back tomorrow."

63
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,253
That was a catastrophe,

64
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,980
something I had not imagined,

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,799
something that I didn't like,

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,810
something that I didn't
accept at that point in time.

67
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,770
And I felt all the work that I've done

68
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,760
has just gone to the bin
at the end of the day,

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,162
and I need to repeat it again and again.

70
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,920
So it's very clear at that
point in time in my career

71
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,530
when I was a software developer,

72
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,260
we had delivery pressures.

73
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,530
I had to deploy that for the business,

74
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,090
but I literally had no
training in security.

75
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,490
I never knew what good looks like.

76
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,187
And yes, that's security
professional who mentioned,

77
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,510
"Tanvi, you cannot go live today,"

78
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,283
was the biggest bottleneck of
my life at that point in time.

79
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,810
Now, for all the DevOps community,

80
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,130
if you are feeling the pain,

81
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,710
trust me, I have been there.

82
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,540
That's when I made a decision in my life,

83
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,380
okay Tanvi.

84
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,799
Let's see if the grass is
green on the other side.

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,570
So I changed my career in 2016.

86
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,750
I became a security professional

87
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,320
in the DevSecOps space in 2016 itself,

88
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,290
but I was only related
to application security

89
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,070
at that point in time.

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,010
Now I was doing secure
code reviews, not for one,

91
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,960
but for hundreds of teams.

92
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,680
And I understood at that point in time,

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,360
that yes, it is a major pain.

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,710
I thought grass was
green on the other side,

95
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,659
but it's not easy.

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,573
It is hard at the end of the day.

97
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,100
What I understood at that point in time

98
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,400
is there was not enough
Tanvi's who could help

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,849
match the pace with the teams as well.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,370
I lacked that scalability.

101
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,660
I alone had to check hundred projects

102
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,250
who were deploying ASAP right next week.

103
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,320
I was pressurized to compromise quality

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,712
and security for the sake
of deployment as well.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
And that's where I understood yes,

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,909
the risk is increasing,

107
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,440
but we cannot compromise on
security at the same time.

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,760
Developers at that point in time hated me.

109
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,840
That's when it struck
in my mind, yes Tanvi.

110
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,679
You've now formally became
that same security SME

111
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,053
who blocked you at that night that day.

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,560
That's when I decided to
understand the problem a bit better

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,340
and resolve it at the very core as well.

114
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,460
I didn't want to be on the other side.

115
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,450
I didn't want to be in security

116
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,960
or in the tech space as well.

117
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,969
I wanted something more
to resolve that problem.

118
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,320
It required something more as well.

119
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,810
The most important part
was to understand what

120
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,403
really the problem is.

121
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,810
So we have all the tools in place.

122
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,100
We have everyone in the industry

123
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,560
has all the security tools
possible in their pipelines

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,190
at this point in time.

125
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,590
But why is we still not there
yet in reducing the risk

126
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,560
or helping the business go faster as well,

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,573
because we are understanding
the problem very wrong.

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,719
So the problem is that we
have a culture of blame game.

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,930
Avery department in the organization

130
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,060
has conflicting priorities as well.

131
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,580
And yes, as security
people, we are not enough,

132
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,530
and that is the reason
why maybe are a blocker.

133
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,039
But at the end of the day,

134
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
the underlying gist of the problem

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,130
is that it is a people
problem and a process problem,

136
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,930
and not exactly a tech problem.

137
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,690
Now think from an application
security perspective,

138
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,340
despite the fact that we
can have all the tools,

139
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,070
the actual remediation needs

140
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,710
to happen by people on the ground,

141
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,483
who have limited or no training.

142
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,610
There organization security professionals

143
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,440
still need to review and
have that governance well.

144
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,850
And it's a known fact that security

145
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,570
is still involved in the triaging process,

146
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,370
in an engagement model

147
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,580
still in every large corporation as well.

148
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,780
So what should we do?

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,479
How much can we resolve as well?

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,200
That gave birth to an idea.

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,469
What if we have champions on the ground,

152
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,340
who now scale security as well?

153
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,340
And champions are passionate
people who work on the ground

154
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,330
and help security scale as well.

155
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,690
But we slow understood

156
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,303
that the security champions
program is also not enough,

157
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,700
because the traditional
security champion programs

158
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,479
target on people
interaction with security,

159
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,950
tech interaction with security.

160
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,250
We wanted something more.

161
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,830
We wanted to scale security in the team

162
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,760
so that those people have roles defined.

163
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,010
They are traditionally
called security expertise

164
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,980
working within tech.

165
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,820
And that is what gave birth to the program

166
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,670
that I'm going to talk about,

167
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,590
and that is completely a culture uplift,

168
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,599
but with people at the
heart at the core of it.

169
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,460
So let's start with the what now.

170
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,190
Before I actually get
into the silver bullet

171
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,060
or the actual strategy as well,

172
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,570
most important part is to always
align to business priority.

173
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,770
What do we want at the end of the day?

174
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,710
What is our mission?

175
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,840
Why are we even doing this?

176
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,760
So our mission was very clear.

177
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,939
We want the business to go faster,

178
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,700
but we want the business
to deliver secure value

179
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,049
back for customers as well.

180
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,599
The vision was very clear.

181
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,169
We as security professionals don't want

182
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,370
to get perceived as a blocker.

183
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,540
We want to take a governance role,

184
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,709
but we want security to
be a business enabler.

185
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,710
Putting these fundamental laws
in our mind at the very core,

186
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,920
we defined a people strategy revolving

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,793
that sits at the core of
process and tech enablement.

188
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,199
Now from a people perspective,

189
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,800
let's get into the what.

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,209
So again, the program
from a culture uplift

191
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,930
is a very much people-centric strategy.

192
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,739
We wanted champions,

193
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,470
but we didn't want the champions

194
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,980
only to interact with security.

195
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,040
We wanted them to adopt self-sufficiency

196
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,079
at the end of the day,

197
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,100
because we want the business to go faster.

198
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,170
We wanted to break the silos

199
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,790
between the security expertise
and the tech teams as well.

200
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,280
We as security people don't know enough

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,620
about the actual tech as well,

202
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,470
because we are sitting on the outside.

203
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,053
We can only see what we are
shown as well at the same time.

204
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,070
The next part was fostering
a culture of accountability.

205
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,930
Again, it's very easy to
put on a piece of paper.

206
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,209
Security is everyone's
responsibility and accountability,

207
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,410
but does that actually happen

208
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,310
in reality on the ground as well?

209
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,469
My answer is no.

210
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,500
The next one was,

211
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,490
how can we now have people

212
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,310
who are actual security expertise,

213
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,239
but working within their own teams

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,440
to bridge the cyber skill gap coming

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,970
from the application security domain.

216
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,170
And yes, we wanted gender balance.

217
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,689
When we are building a strategy,

218
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,930
we wanted complete 50/50 representation

219
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,780
from men and women at the same time.

220
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,193
And that is the six pillars
from a champion perspective.

221
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,580
Now how does that look on
a strategic level as well?

222
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,350
That was broken down into eight pillars.

223
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,920
Now these pillars are not
at all easy to implement,

224
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,050
but when they work hand in hand

225
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,319
they actually help teams get empowered,

226
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,430
and build self-sufficiency,

227
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,209
build cyber skills within the teams,

228
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,570
bridge the gender gap
and build accountability

229
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,050
at the end of the day.

230
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,270
The final goal is to help go faster

231
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,933
with secure value built-in.

232
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,230
Keeping that in mind, these
eight pillars were defined.

233
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,360
Now let us understand
what these pillars are,

234
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,220
and how do they actually
work on the ground.

235
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,640
The most important part for you

236
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,240
who are listening to this call today,

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,070
is to how you can take
the different pillars

238
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,470
out of this strategy as well,

239
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,930
and use that in your own strategies.

240
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,790
It is very much fluid.

241
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,819
Many pieces can be taken out of it

242
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,620
and leverage for the benefit

243
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,520
of your own organizations as well.

244
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,770
So let us start with the first pillar,

245
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,960
that is fostering a
culture of accountability

246
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,343
and self-sufficiency.

247
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,363
Let's deep dive.

248
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,242
Cool.

249
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:49,670
Now fostering a culture of accountability

250
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,610
and self-sufficiency,
the most important part

251
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,890
was to literally have
the champions enabled.

252
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,460
Now the champions work as,

253
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,070
yes, we have the traditional
champions program in place,

254
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,180
but then the idea was to elevate it

255
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,510
to a level two and level three

256
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,470
to have people align with
certain accountabilities.

257
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,410
Now all the champions
within the champions program

258
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,120
really have accountabilities
defined to them.

259
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,470
For example, some of the champions

260
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,390
could be a secure code peer reviewer.

261
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,180
Some of the champions could actually

262
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,979
enable secure design functions.

263
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,640
Some of the champions could work

264
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,610
with security architecture as well.

265
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,510
And some of them could take up the roles

266
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,583
of offensive security testing as well.

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,630
The tech teams are so
wider in their skillsets,

268
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,490
that every single role
within the delivery teams

269
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,700
can actually be converted into

270
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,230
an equivalent security
role at the end of the day.

271
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,480
The idea was not to have

272
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,710
that enablement for everyone on the team,

273
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,700
but to have an enablement for one person

274
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,980
within every single team, from
a scalability perspective.

275
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,040
What do they do at the end of the day?

276
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,689
Once the accountabilities are defined,

277
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,240
they help drive security maturity as well.

278
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,510
And yes, they collaborate with one another

279
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,360
so that we could have more of
them at the end of the day.

280
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,770
Now how do they break the silos?

281
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,180
The most important part,

282
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,160
because that is the structure that exists

283
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,680
in most organizations.

284
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,130
So there is tech

285
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,750
and there is security
at the end of the day.

286
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,200
How do the champions sit at
the intersection of the tool

287
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,090
and help drive security as well?

288
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,460
Again, the idea is to nominate the roles

289
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,120
that you feel would be the
most beneficial from this.

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,950
Ideal roles are your software engineers,

291
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,200
your software testers and
your product owners as well.

292
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,530
They're very easy roles to
transition into security as well.

293
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,260
Now they don't only
sit in their own teams,

294
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,610
but they act as a virtual part

295
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,420
of security teams working
within the tech teams

296
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,069
and vice versa.

297
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,520
They act as virtual part of tech teams

298
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,699
also working with the security team.

299
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,640
So that is how they
break the silos as well,

300
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,006
like a virtual talent pool.

301
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:22,062
Breaking this into wider
categories as well.

302
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:26,560
The program is broken down
into various levels as well.

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,030
So think about it.

304
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,709
Are you only training your developers

305
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,490
for the sake of training with a view

306
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,160
that tomorrow all the
vulnerabilities will be resolved?

307
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,719
But in security we have so
many challenges as well.

308
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,370
What happens to pen testing issues?

309
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,020
What happens to secure design as well?

310
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,540
And not everyone coming from tech

311
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,030
would want to really align
to one security field itself.

312
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,510
They might want to learn
something entirely new

313
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,750
within security as well.

314
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,830
So that is where the
program was broken down

315
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,880
into three various levels,

316
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,340
but every level optimizes
the DevOps life cycle

317
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,443
at the end of the day.

318
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,099
So let's look at level one for example.

319
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,440
Level one security champions are trained

320
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,040
in primary application security skillset,

321
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
but at the end of the day,

322
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,500
their task is to work with

323
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,110
the application security
expertise as well.

324
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,980
And that is what they would be learning

325
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,190
and getting transitioned into.

326
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,860
Same applies for level two

327
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,130
and for level three as well.

328
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,490
Looking from a tech perspective,

329
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,750
these are roles that are coming
from the existing assets,

330
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,800
that is people working
within the tech teams,

331
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,430
and there are no new skillsets

332
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,209
or no new people getting added

333
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,940
in those teams from a security front.

334
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,750
They are people coming
right from the tech teams

335
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,350
at the end of the day.

336
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,600
The only thing is how do these
people at the end of the day

337
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,660
break the traditional engagement models

338
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,673
and work with the security teams as well?

339
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,199
And I'll get to that in a bit,

340
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
but the most important part

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,900
is how do they even get nominated?

342
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,760
And how do we encourage
diversity of thought

343
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,300
and inclusion and
diversity at the same time?

344
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,010
So very important is when
you are nominating people

345
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,623
into the program as well,

346
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,660
they can come from any background as well.

347
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,219
And any workforce, any role
can actually be transitioned

348
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,180
at the end of the day.

349
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,449
The idea again is to have
50/50 representation as well.

350
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,430
But trust me, we have graduates.

351
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,479
We have really experienced people.

352
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,490
We have product owners.

353
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,480
We have senior execs as well

354
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,990
who have onboarded into
the program as well.

355
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,960
And everyone has a
different accountability

356
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,690
and responsibility to take care of.

357
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,900
And when you have that
diversity of thought,

358
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,340
people coming from different backgrounds,

359
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,460
skill sets as well,

360
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,240
the idea becomes even more
beautiful and wider as well,

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,050
because then you start taking the opinions

362
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,210
and the feedback from varied skills,

363
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,960
and makes it even more
beautiful at the end of the day.

364
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,510
Now again, the most important part

365
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,740
is yes, we have nominated those people.

366
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,910
So let's say we have one person coming

367
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,050
from every single scrum of the company.

368
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,589
What do we do now?

369
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,199
How do we even train them

370
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,040
into being a security professional?

371
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,030
That's where the empowerment comes from.

372
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,129
And that's the second pillar.

373
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,860
In terms of empowerment,

374
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,479
the most important part

375
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,790
is not only to do a security
certification program

376
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,923
at the end of the day,

377
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,370
for a learning to be effective.

378
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,570
It is very important that we always follow

379
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,550
a 70, 20 and a 10 structure.

380
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,100
70 means what the people do on the job,

381
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,250
and that is where the accountabilities

382
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,590
that we defined in the very start help.

383
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,080
For example, a secure code reviewer

384
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,149
has a accountability defined

385
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,113
that the person is
reviewing the code securely.

386
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,460
And that is a job that
they're doing on the ground

387
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,850
because they cannot train
everybody in everything.

388
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,870
They learn right at that point in time.

389
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,879
The second is what do you
learn from your peers,

390
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,710
from your community?

391
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,580
But what do you even learn
from the security expertise

392
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,870
that is available to you as well?

393
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,959
And like I previously spoke,

394
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,170
that all the champions
are one-on-one mapped

395
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,070
with the relevant security
teams as well, virtually.

396
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,450
That is how the learn directly

397
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,563
from the security expertise as well.

398
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,020
At the very end comes your 10.

399
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,940
And that is your actual training program.

400
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,320
Training can only help you
up till a certain point,

401
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,100
help understand concepts,
certain technologies as well,

402
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,230
certain skill sets, certain abilities,

403
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,970
with knowledge levels as well.

404
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,030
The best value that you get out of it

405
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,330
is what are you doing on the
ground at the end of the day.

406
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,129
So that's why 70-20-10 was very important.

407
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,380
Now breaking the empowerment down

408
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,380
into further pillars was
very important as well.

409
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,813
So the first one point is

410
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:25,990
when you are transitioning
roles into security,

411
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,560
the underlying framework
that works with it

412
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,870
is the NIST NICE framework.

413
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,487
Use that framework to make that transition

414
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,930
into cybersecurity as well.

415
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,820
But secondly, most important
thing is about the training.

416
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,560
So again, the trainings
can be classroom based,

417
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,909
online based, tournament based,

418
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,320
but the most important
part as I said before,

419
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,899
is your on the job learning.

420
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,130
Now on the job learning is certainly

421
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,230
from the security expertise
that is available for you,

422
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,010
but it is very important
for security teams

423
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,129
to work in this virtual
talent pool as well

424
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,663
to build guardrails.

425
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,110
So in DevSecOps world,

426
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,129
while you can automate most
of the things around CI/CD,

427
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,210
but there are always manual components

428
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,150
that cannot always be automated.

429
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,260
Think about secure requirements.

430
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,560
Think about secure design.

431
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,870
It is very important for security teams

432
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,090
to move out of engagement processes,

433
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,250
and start building those guardrails.

434
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,840
Now think about it, despite the fact

435
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,060
that we have built massive automation,

436
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,700
and there is a security
professional like Tanvi sitting

437
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,890
and reviewing hundreds of
reports at the end of the day,

438
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,610
is that helping the business go faster?

439
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,459
My answer is no.

440
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,620
But various security champions

441
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,030
sitting within the teams reviewing,

442
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,600
and ensuring that the code is secure,

443
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,250
we'll help the teams go faster.

444
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,120
And that is where guardrails
are more important

445
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,723
over security engagement processes.

446
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,429
Very important part is to
build those guidelines as well,

447
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,733
because most of the teams within tech,

448
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,120
they have brilliant ideas

449
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,530
and they're built for innovation,

450
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,250
but it is very important
being a security professional

451
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,920
to guide those teams into
what those best practices

452
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,330
actually look like as well.

453
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,669
And that is where your
guidelines come into the picture.

454
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,050
But yes, provide them access

455
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:34,040
to the security tools that you
want the teams to leverage.

456
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,620
Most of the security tools are built

457
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,229
with a viewpoint of
enabling security teams.

458
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,750
They're very rarely
built for the tech teams

459
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,220
at the end of the day, even if they are.

460
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,460
It is very difficult
for the tech teams to go

461
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,150
and remediate vulnerabilities
at the end of the day as well.

462
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,426
So again, provide them
access to the tools,

463
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:59,149
guide them on what does
effective remediation

464
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,070
actually mean like.

465
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,939
But very important is
not to just train them,

466
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,760
and leave them saying

467
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,020
that you are now a security professional.

468
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,340
It takes years to build that capability.

469
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
And it's very important

470
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,637
that in the virtual talent pool security,

471
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:17,643
and tech is working together.

472
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,760
And that is where

473
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,120
they are provided access to the
relevant security expertise.

474
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,580
The differences that
the security expertise

475
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,090
is now not engaged in an engagement model,

476
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,199
rather they are building guidelines,

477
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,400
and guardrails for the
teams and working with tech,

478
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,010
and enabling them.

479
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,113
All in all, security is
governance at the end of the day.

480
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,540
Now moving on to the other pillars,

481
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,430
and I wouldn't get deep
dive into these ones,

482
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,820
because they're very huge
strategies by itself,

483
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,710
but on a very high level,

484
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,970
it is very important when

485
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,560
you're building culture
uplifts at the end of the day

486
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,020
to have top-down buy-in.

487
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,100
It is very easily put on a piece of paper,

488
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,320
get every exec in the organization

489
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
to buy-in into your strategy.

490
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,910
It's not easy at all.

491
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,010
What is the value that we are providing

492
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,160
at the end of the day,

493
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,330
by having security expertise built-in?

494
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,560
The teams actually have
lesser operational cost

495
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,990
at the end of the day,

496
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,590
reduced incidents as
well and reduce rework.

497
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,970
Imagine the time that is spent in a sprint

498
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,020
to remediate the vulnerabilities as well.

499
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,750
How amazing that would be

500
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,700
if the teams were
spending it in innovation,

501
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,940
rather than cleaning
the older stuff as well.

502
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,850
But very important in the program

503
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,149
was to drive it bottom-up.

504
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,160
The champions who are now our counterparts

505
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,420
define the strategy as well.

506
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,940
And that is the reason why
it is so open in nature,

507
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,313
because the teams define
how they need to operate.

508
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,980
I've learned this in my security career

509
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,590
that as a security professional,

510
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,159
we cannot go in tech teams,

511
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,120
and define how the tech would operate.

512
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,209
The tech needs to define
how they would operate,

513
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,500
and security needs to be built
in at the end of the day.

514
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,820
That is what the bottom-up
approach helps as well.

515
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,560
The next importance is the feedback loops

516
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,830
and the optimization,
and improve movements

517
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,092
that it brings along with it as well.

518
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,530
Moving on to the next pillar,

519
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,950
like I was just talking about

520
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,200
is your continuous improvement.

521
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,950
Now continuous improvement happens

522
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,160
when you have a community.

523
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,510
How it's generally run

524
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,190
is using design thinking
workshops as well.

525
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,280
What worked for us?

526
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,770
What didn't work for us?

527
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,610
In a simple (indistinct)
methodology, it is retrospective.

528
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,149
What worked for us in a sprint?

529
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,110
How can we improve
better for the next time

530
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,969
and what are new cool things
that we can do in the space?

531
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,130
That is what continuous
improvement brings,

532
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,090
but it is very important to remember

533
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,919
that when you're building a
really huge culture change,

534
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,900
embrace failure, because you
will fail every single day.

535
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,190
By the time you can actually
nearly reach a point

536
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,890
where you are somewhat stable.

537
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,840
So have that failure in mind.

538
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,653
Embrace it, would be my
opinion on it as well.

539
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,210
The next one is your
rewards and recognition.

540
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,220
Now think about it.

541
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,800
You have so many people who are coming up

542
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,480
nominating themselves to
actually help scale out security,

543
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,610
and resolve business problems.

544
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,510
The question is, what
are we actually doing

545
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,460
for them at the end of the day?

546
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,570
What is there for them?

547
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,080
Why should they even nominate themselves?

548
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,300
And that is where rewards

549
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,250
and recognition strategies help a lot.

550
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,920
Think about your intrinsic and
extrinsic motivators as well.

551
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,890
The idea is never to pay money to people

552
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,270
or give them promotions
at the end of the day.

553
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,020
That doesn't build positive cultures.

554
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,740
Positive cultures are
built on recognition.

555
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,980
It could be as simple as a pat on the back

556
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,387
or a senior exec coming up and saying,

557
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,870
"You're doing an amazing job."

558
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,340
But also remember,

559
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,120
that it's very important that now

560
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,020
that we've created this
amazing talent pool

561
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,330
invested in them as well,

562
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,949
how can we open up security
roles for our internal expertise

563
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,110
rather than hiring them
from the very outside.

564
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,199
At the end of the day,

565
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,000
whoever we train internally,

566
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,110
is a workforce that we're enabling out

567
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,350
in the industry as well.

568
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,570
Keep that in mind,

569
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,419
and that is very important.

570
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,680
But the most important part is
up skilling, cross-skilling,

571
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,340
and career development
of the people as well.

572
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,389
But very important is the recognition.

573
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,250
The doubt that people
will wear out, burnout,

574
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,423
and lose interest and
motivation eventually as well.

575
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,050
Now very important part was
inclusion and diversity.

576
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,379
When we started it,

577
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,220
most of the roles that comes
from tech are generally men,

578
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,630
and there are very few women, even in IT,

579
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,340
that are available at this point in time.

580
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,300
How to bridge that in
the security workforce

581
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,159
was an even bigger challenge.

582
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,610
So what I have here is from
a strategic perspective,

583
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,010
how it actually looks like.

584
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,090
So we have women who are
coming up being nominated

585
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,990
as the future cybersecurity
workforce as well,

586
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,293
because we need that too.

587
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,420
The most important part
is having a diversity

588
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,950
and inclusion perspective into
your people centric strategy,

589
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,540
has actually got us 50% of representation,

590
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,350
nominations as only women.

591
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,750
So we have hit that
target very well as well,

592
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,630
and that would help the
industry with bridging the gap

593
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,003
with females as well in the future.

594
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Now the next one is maturity.

595
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,980
Now we have spoken about
who are the people?

596
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,970
Where are they nominated from?

597
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,110
How are they working

598
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,899
with this security expertise as well?

599
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,330
How are we empowering them?

600
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,189
How are we recognizing them?

601
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,440
All the people, culture
related stuff as well.

602
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,690
How do they know what is
good security practice

603
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,640
always comes from your maturity framework.

604
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,640
So when you're building a
people-centric DevSecOps strategy,

605
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,730
I must say, always build
a maturity framework.

606
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,730
There are so many maturity frameworks

607
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,810
that are existing (indistinct).

608
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,100
These model is an amazing one

609
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,419
that I am personally leveraging as well.

610
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,070
A very important part
is to break that down

611
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,580
and expand it based on how
your organization operates.

612
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,830
What do you want your champions
to drive in every quarter

613
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,149
at the end of the day as well?

614
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,980
That is their main task,
drive security maturity.

615
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,340
How do they do that?

616
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,840
The maturity model helps that.

617
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,070
Take for example, a simple addition

618
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,350
in the maturity model could be,

619
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,800
if you have application security tools

620
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,169
are you actually scanning
once before the release

621
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,850
or you're scanning
continuously every single day?

622
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,169
That marks the maturity of the team.

623
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,680
What are you doing about
the vulnerabilities?

624
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,920
Are you remediating your
high vulnerabilities as well?

625
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,900
Break them down on the severities.

626
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,420
That is a category in the
maturity framework as well.

627
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,640
Again, it is very important
for the teams to know

628
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,040
what does good security at the
end of the day really mean,

629
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,510
for them to do anything,

630
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,133
and drive anything back
in the teams as well.

631
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,870
Now again,

632
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,030
I've spoken and shared

633
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,350
a really really large strategy as well.

634
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,713
Now this is not at all easy.

635
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,900
How we started with it
was take simple teams,

636
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,640
simple five teams as well,

637
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,810
and drive those five teams

638
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,780
all these pillars of the strategy.

639
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,530
Eventually I thought that
maybe we could let loose

640
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,750
or one or two pillars,

641
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,240
but trust me when your work on the ground,

642
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,080
all these pillars work collectively,

643
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,550
and that's what brings
massive optimization.

644
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,669
We have achieved optimization

645
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,340
at least over 50% in all of these teams.

646
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,582
Now one pillar that I missed
in all of this was the metrics.

647
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,610
Now think about your metrics

648
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,479
that you want to drive
in your organization.

649
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,340
Do you want reduced
identified vulnerabilities?

650
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,970
Do you want increased
remediated vulnerabilities?

651
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,150
The strategy actually drives that as well.

652
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,360
It's very important to define your goals

653
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,290
and your metrics in the very start,

654
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,760
and then drive it through the people

655
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
linking that with the processes,

656
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,103
and the technology at the end of the day.

657
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,440
Now of course, this does not come easy.

658
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,660
It is very challenging
at the end of the day.

659
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,930
The biggest challenge that I feel

660
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,090
every person who's building
a security champions program

661
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,959
is executive buy-in.

662
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,130
That is very difficult
and very hard as well.

663
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,030
But again, if you're mapping that

664
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,460
to your business goals and objectives,

665
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,590
it'll become easier to drive that

666
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,699
at the end of the day as well.

667
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Now revisiting all the
strategic portions together,

668
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,340
I'm stumbling today.

669
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,139
Let's collate them together

670
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,300
and have a look at what have
we actually learned now.

671
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,360
So again, whenever you have
a DevOps transformation

672
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,820
always start with a
people-centric approach,

673
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,303
a culture-centric approach to DevSecOps.

674
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,510
Now DevOps by itself is
a culture enablement,

675
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,210
why not DevSecOps?

676
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,860
Why don't we target it with
tools at the end of the day?

677
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,310
So always have a security
champions program,

678
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,210
but the security champions
program needs to be built

679
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,030
on the pillar of empowerment.

680
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,330
It needs to have 70-20-10.

681
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,350
If you have champions on the ground,

682
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,550
and their only task is to
interact with security,

683
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,080
that will not help anyone.

684
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,100
It will only help everyone partially,

685
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,429
but that is not a complete solution.

686
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,590
What are the champions
driving on the ground?

687
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,199
And that's the important part.

688
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,469
Mention their roles.

689
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,060
Mention their accountabilities.

690
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,280
Mention their responsibilities
at the end of the day.

691
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,510
Now what is it that you have for them?

692
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,300
And what is it that you have
back for the industry as well?

693
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,590
Do we have champions
nominated to only get trained

694
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,340
at the end of the day?

695
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,280
If yes, then why not
have a bigger strategy

696
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,603
that resolves the skills gap as well?

697
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:54,270
So think that these people are
now your virtual talent pool,

698
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,420
they're working with you.

699
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,310
Set them up for success
within security as well.

700
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,830
Again, like I mentioned,

701
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,339
people are your greatest assets.

702
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:07,500
Whenever you have agile methodologies

703
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,890
instead of having thousand security people

704
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,480
who actually do not exist in the industry,

705
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,870
think about how can you use

706
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,310
your existing organizational assets,

707
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,770
and people are your biggest
assets at the end of the day.

708
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,460
Don't forget to add in your collaborations

709
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,300
and your diversity of thought.

710
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,060
Design thinking workshops help a lot.

711
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,679
And I must recommend design
thinking training for everyone

712
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,630
who's doing a culture uplift
at the end of the day as well.

713
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,700
Now inclusion and diversity
cannot be left alone.

714
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,680
That needs to be added as a
part of the strategy as well.

715
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,490
And that is what sets the
organization for success

716
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,390
at the end of the day.

717
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,870
Now again, like I
mentioned, embrace failure.

718
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,909
It will fail and the
strategy needs to be liquid,

719
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,280
and needs to change eventually
with the changing times.

720
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,410
Embrace that failure and
do not try to perfect it,

721
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,970
because no one can.

722
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,040
Now always think what
is there for the people.

723
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,770
Always thing what is
there for your champions.

724
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,570
Yes, we have remediated
the vulnerabilities

725
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,810
and yes, we have reduced the risk,

726
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,620
but variability remediation

727
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,810
and risk remediation actually
comes as a by-product.

728
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,940
Then you actually do something back

729
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,583
for the champions as well.

730
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,670
Last but not the least,
establish your communities.

731
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,830
Don't just train the developers
just for the sake of it,

732
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,290
and think that eventually after two years

733
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,500
all the security issues
will amazingly vanish.

734
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,603
That doesn't happen at all.

735
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,029
Last but the least,

736
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,630
how can you actually apply this

737
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,370
in your current strategies as well?

738
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,632
So again, what can you do?

739
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,620
So yes, for everyone who already

740
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,819
has a security champion program in place,

741
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,120
what can you do next week?

742
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,080
What can you do right away?

743
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,009
Go back, look at your
security champions program

744
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,820
that you already have existing.

745
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,555
Have a look at that.

746
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:11,770
Are you training your developers
for the sake of training?

747
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,920
Are you training your developers

748
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,700
so that they could interact
better with security

749
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,149
or are you training your
developers to actually resolve

750
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,170
or remediate the risks and
let the business go faster?

751
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,290
Look at your strategy again,

752
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,690
and all this define the roles.

753
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,080
The next important part
is what would you do

754
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,220
in the next three months?

755
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,839
For that, revisit the roles,

756
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,182
because whatever you will
create in the first go

757
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:41,399
might actually be entirely
incorrect as well.

758
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,260
Now start looking

759
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,900
at your security
engagement models as well,

760
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,910
because that is where
all your bottlenecks are.

761
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,830
Revisit how can you break those silos

762
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,380
in a organizational aspect as well,

763
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,460
and bring that change.

764
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,850
The security teams need
to build guardrails

765
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,323
and not engagement models
at the end of the day.

766
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,390
Now start moving the strategy
into new roles as well.

767
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,069
Think about your release train engineers,

768
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,610
your scrum masters, and the testers,

769
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,800
and the reliability engineers
who are very critical

770
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,870
in the entire delivery life cycle.

771
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,130
What is their task at the end
of the day within the teams?

772
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,480
Once you establishing it,

773
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,440
start revisiting it in the
next six months as well.

774
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,670
Add more teams to it,

775
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,150
but very important is align
that to people and culture.

776
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,620
Think about how are you cross-skilling

777
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,330
and making cross functional teams

778
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,020
in your organization, right?

779
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,200
So start thinking, what
about their recognitions?

780
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,560
What about their career
development pathways?

781
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,980
What do you actually have for
them at the end of the day?

782
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,020
I say that because I've
been in both the places,

783
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,530
and if you have been
in the security world,

784
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,170
felt frustrated as I have been,

785
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,440
or in the development world
felt frustrated again,

786
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,753
as I have been,

787
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,300
the answer is take the middle gap.

788
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,240
Start bridging the gap
between the security

789
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,640
and start building that
virtual talent pool

790
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,160
that actually resolves the
frustrations of the both ends.

791
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,899
And that would be all for me.

792
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,603
Thank you so much for today.
