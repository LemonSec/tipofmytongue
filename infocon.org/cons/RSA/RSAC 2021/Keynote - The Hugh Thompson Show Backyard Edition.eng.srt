00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:04,279
(gentle digital music)

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:16,393
(gentle digital music)

4
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:19,643
(gentle digital music)

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,163
- Welcome to the last
session of RSA Conference.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,170
What an incredible year it's been.

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,430
I hope we've had a great
time at the conference.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,750
I hope you learned a lot.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,460
I hope you got to see virtually

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,513
some old friends during the event.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,470
It has been an unbelievable year.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,480
You know, I couldn't have imagined,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,209
when we picked this theme of
resilience a long time ago,

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,480
pre-COVID, for this year's conference,

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,260
what it would end up actually meaning.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,760
So many of us have spent a lotta time

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,170
on these

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,920
meeting video platforms.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,420
And at first when you start doing

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,920
a lotta these video conferences,

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,950
it feels just really impersonal.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,910
You just wish you could be there

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,289
across a table or at a
Starbucks with the person

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,230
instead of in a little square.

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,550
But what I've found is, as time goes on,

26
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,550
you actually learn more about those folks.

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,610
You see, for example, a
dog walk into the shot,

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,950
and everybody relaxes.

29
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,663
Or a child comes in and
delivers a bottle of water.

30
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,103
It just brings humanity,

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,067
and you learn more,

32
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,220
and in some ways, you become closer.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,630
But sometimes things don't go that well

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,350
during these calls.

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,800
So I always use one specific room

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,690
to do video calls from.

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,850
And I had a call, it was
coming up in three minutes.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,860
I go into this room,

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,210
and we've got five young kids,

40
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,470
and I find our smallest child,

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,460
who's two years old,

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,460
just chewing on some rubber
dinosaur in that room,

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,380
and he's, like, so content, he's happy.

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm like, geez, I can't disturb the guy.

45
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,410
And so I'm going now into
unchartered territory,

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,020
looking for another
room to do a video call.

47
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,560
So I get to my son's room,

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,320
one of my older sons,

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,549
and I peek in the door,

50
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,640
and the guy has got a volcano,

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,549
probably this high off the ground,

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,450
made out of, looks like
cardboard or something,

53
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,790
maybe boxes from Amazon,

54
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,709
and he's got a giant bottle of vinegar,

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,860
and he's got a huge box of baking soda,

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,730
which is just a recipe for disaster.

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,100
But again, conference
call's about to start,

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,680
don't have time to deal with it,

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,530
I'm like, I'll deal with the aftermath.

60
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,000
And so finally I find this third room

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,710
that seems perfect.

62
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,930
It's got a bed, there's
no children in there.

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,900
So I sit down on the bed,

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,540
I open the laptop, start the conference,

65
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,290
say hi to everybody, the video's on.

66
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,049
And then, out of the corner of my eye,

67
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,000
I see a live bunny

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,340
walk across the room.

69
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,590
And so, you know, I'm just, like,

70
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,260
okay, just ignore the bunny,

71
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,149
focus on the video.

72
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,280
And then I see our two twins

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,840
emerging out of some hide

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
that they had with the bunny,

75
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
some big blanket,

76
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,010
and now they're chasing this bunny.

77
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,420
Chaos erupts in that room.

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,730
They go after the bunny.

79
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,149
The bunny jumps.

80
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,510
The bunny jumps on the laptop.

81
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,049
I'm trying to turn the
video off on the laptop,

82
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,220
and finally I get the video off,

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,090
but I didn't turn the sound off.

84
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,680
It sounds like just some
incredible scuffle that's going on.

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,399
I hear people from the
meeting saying, "Are you okay?

86
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,159
Do we need to call somebody?"

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,977
Welcome to 2021 (laughs).

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,309
This is just one of those
experiences that you get used to

89
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,813
and you adapt to it.

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,690
And I think as we emerge from this

91
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,740
and as we get to see each other
in person again next year,

92
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,060
we will appreciate it so much more.

93
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,150
And so I'm so happy today

94
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,969
to have with me a guest

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,810
that is somebody I've always admired,

96
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,890
just an incredibly, incredibly bright,

97
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,159
but also nice, human being.

98
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,150
And his defining characteristic to me

99
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,799
is he's always happy.

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,970
So ladies and gentlemen,

101
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,010
please welcome

102
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,712
Steve Wozniak.

103
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,474
- Oh my gosh!
- Hey Woz!

104
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,930
So great to see you man, how's everything?

105
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,616
- Wow, it's great to see you again.

106
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,270
- Have a seat, have a seat.
- This is a very special day

107
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,010
for me, a very special occasion.

108
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,650
This is probably the
first time for a little,

109
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,489
kind of a chat and a conversation

110
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,990
to actually put on dress shoes.

111
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,810
- Oh wow, man!
- In about five years, yeah.

112
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,840
- Every time I talk to you,

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,210
every time I see you, you're happy.

114
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,969
You always find a way to be happy.

115
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,160
- I'm lucky that I
found a formula for that

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,200
when I was very young, like 20 years old,

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,460
when your personality's forming for life.

118
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,900
And I just said, "I wanna
do a lotta happy things."

119
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,429
Jokes is the center of it.

120
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,968
Make up jokes, make up pranks.

121
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:50,801
- Oh boy.

122
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,090
- But go to things you enjoy,

123
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,320
like comedy and concerts,

124
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,962
and things that make you smile,

125
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,760
then subtract the frowns.

126
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,599
Happiness equals smiles minus frowns.

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
- Yeah, I gotta ask you,

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,967
we picked a theme for
this year's conference,

129
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,039
and we didn't know at the time

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,510
we would be in the midst of COVID

131
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,440
and everybody would be locked down,

132
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,960
but the theme was resilience.

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,659
(Steve laughs)

134
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,000
I've just heard so many
incredible stories from you

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,590
of times when you've
had to be so inventive,

136
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,859
so resilient, and I was
hoping you could share

137
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,640
your favorite, your favorite one of those.

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,755
- One of 'em was we had our computer,

139
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:33,960
the Apple II computer was gonna be

140
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,030
all the revenues of Apple

141
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,500
for the first 10 years of the company.

142
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,700
This was an important product.

143
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,623
- No pressure, no pressure.

144
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,620
- I loved games, I build
in my love into products,

145
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,350
and the Apple II computer

146
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,210
was the very first time that
arcade games were in color.

147
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,719
Atari in Los Gatos, Atari
right here in Los Gatos,

148
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,000
was starting the industry of arcade games.

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,330
They were all black-and-white,

150
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,109
and they had 100 chips
and thousands of wires.

151
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,140
An engineer like me
starts hooking up wires

152
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,630
to get plus and minus
signals going the right way

153
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,020
to make something show up on a TV set.

154
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,870
The Apple II computer was the first time

155
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,440
that arcade games were color,

156
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,307
and the first time they were software.

157
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,180
- I actually didn't realize that.

158
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,930
- You could use the
basic language I wrote,

159
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,360
a nine-year-old kid could,

160
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,020
and could type a game in

161
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,599
with colored things moving on a screen,

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,010
colored things moving on a screen,

163
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,120
and have a decent game in one day.

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,820
And yet, you took an
engineer six months to a year

165
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,590
to get a prototype done with
a thousand wires and all.

166
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,330
No, this was a huge change for gaming,

167
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,990
and that was important for the homes.

168
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,960
I had never in my life
worked with or studied

169
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,010
disks of any type, hardware or software.

170
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,843
- Okay.

171
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:37,676
- That's a starting point.

172
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,729
I went to a meeting, a staff
meeting one day at Apple,

173
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,370
and I'm quiet and shy, I
stay in the background.

174
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,670
I don't try to run the business,

175
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,740
step on people's toes.

176
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,090
I do my engineering,

177
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,049
'cause nobody could every
kick me out for that.

178
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,940
And I listened,

179
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,650
and we were gonna be allowed

180
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,731
into Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show.

181
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,020
- That's a big deal, then.

182
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,780
- You grow up as a technical guy,

183
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,539
hooking up Hi-Fis and
turntables and tape recorders

184
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,360
and mixing it all (indistinct).

185
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,630
You wanna go to Las Vegas

186
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,330
to see the new stuff at CES show,

187
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,370
and then it was announced

188
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,810
we were only sending
three marketing people:

189
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,130
Mike Markkula, our
funder who ran marketing;

190
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,440
Steve Jobs, of course,

191
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,300
and I think Gene Carter,
our sales guy were gonna go.

192
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,160
And I'm too shy to say, "Hey,
I'm a founder of the company,

193
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,993
let me go."

194
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,200
- So you weren't in the list?

195
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,087
You didn't make the first cut?

196
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:22,740
- No, I wanted to see Las Vegas.

197
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,830
I'd never been there.

198
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,050
I've heard about it in
movies and TV shows.

199
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,250
I wanted to go,

200
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,420
and for some reason I can't
even explain to this day,

201
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,907
I raised my hand and I said,

202
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,750
"If we have a floppy
disk, can we show it?"

203
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,582
- Okay.

204
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,500
- Well, Mike Markkula said yes.

205
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,809
And I figured, and the back
of my head is spinning,

206
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,039
if we show off the floppy disk,

207
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,872
they have to bring me.

208
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:43,470
I'll be the only one who understands it.

209
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,675
But how do I develop one?

210
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,270
- (laughing) This is such a crisis, right?

211
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,380
- I didn't know anything about chips

212
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,960
and formats on floppy disk.

213
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,820
So Steve Jobs got me a
new Shugart smaller drive,

214
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,510
5" floppy drive.

215
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,500
And I looked and studied their schematic

216
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,600
and reverse engineered it.

217
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,580
Wait a minute, they're taking this,

218
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,480
all these signals in that have meaning

219
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,830
and they're boiling it down

220
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,700
to putting out little
pulses onto a floppy disk

221
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,930
that go up and down,

222
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,439
basically four microsecond
intervals, four or eight.

223
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,660
Wait a minute, I have a whole computer.

224
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,750
I can make my own little
board a lot simpler,

225
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,290
and just send over the signal

226
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,569
that goes to write the floppy disk.

227
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,160
And then reading it back was even tougher,

228
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,170
and I came up with the
most incredible designs

229
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,910
for getting the data to the floppy disk

230
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,810
with no chips.

231
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,810
And coming back, I built
a little microprocessor

232
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,479
out of what's called a state machine.

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,790
I had had a state machine
class at Berkeley.

234
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,410
I had three years of college done,

235
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,350
and two little $1 chips
made a state machine

236
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,730
that was perfect for this.

237
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,690
And so now I could actually
read and write data.

238
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,050
Went down to Las Vegas, went to Las Vegas,

239
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,010
worked all night long

240
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,050
until 6:30 the morning of the show,

241
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,459
and I had it working where
I could actually type,

242
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,390
myself and a programmer Randy Wigginton,

243
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,930
that was in high school in
the Homebrew Computer Club,

244
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,880
we could type run checkbook,

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,630
we'd type r checkbook for now,

246
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,680
and it would run it.

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,512
That's really funny,

248
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,470
but I go back now,

249
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,370
I look at what I did then,

250
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,800
and I say, how did
anyone come up with that?

251
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,930
- Woz, I can't tell you

252
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,000
just what an inspiration you've been

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,200
to so many people, me included.

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,200
And just hearing the way that
you find joy in what you do

255
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,550
is incredible.
- But look at this.

256
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,717
People come to me and they say,

257
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:20,819
"Man, should I go to the university,

258
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,070
or I got this chance to be
in a startup right now?"

259
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,230
You have to know the
person, the individual.

260
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,410
Some, the university might be right,

261
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,300
but usually I wind up saying, "Oh no no,

262
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,102
go with the startup,

263
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:31,610
not because you're doing something great,

264
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,880
you're gonna work really hard,

265
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,950
It's gonna have meaning, passion,

266
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,200
you might change the world,

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,500
but because it's gonna be the
most fun time in your life."

268
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,840
If you're pursuing something
that's never been done before,

269
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,300
you're gonna have the most fun ever.

270
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,132
- I love it.

271
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,230
Oh Woz, thanks so much for being here,

272
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,000
and thanks so much for sharing that.

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,520
I mean, it's such an inspirational tale,

274
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,520
that I think everybody can relate to.

275
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,370
So it's great to see ya,

276
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,150
and remember, come by any time.

277
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,983
- How incredible.

278
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:59,020
I think of the road you're on,

279
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,490
I think one of the members of
Motley Crue still lives here.

280
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,700
- Oh really?

281
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,103
To be continued.

282
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,090
From our family to yours,

283
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,090
stay safe, stay healthy,
and we'll see ya next year.

284
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,943
Bye.
