00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,520
- Welcome to the session

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,880
Patterns for Encryption in Hybrid Cloud.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,330
My name is Mark Buckwell.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm a Cloud Security Architect

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,963
working in IBM to help
clients move to cloud.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,570
First of all, what we're gonna do is

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,940
get a bit of context

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,363
as to why encryption is
important for hybrid clouds.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,510
We have both on-premise

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,470
and we have multiple clouds
in most organizations.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,450
And so it's not just a simple

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,993
solution of creating
one solution that will,

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,040
for cloud and one solution

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,490
for each of the different data centers.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,550
So, what we need to do is
create a hybrid solution.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,820
And so we're gonna go and talk about

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,003
how we build that hybrid
solution for hybrid cloud.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,150
First of all, we're
gonna talk about context.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,129
So one day all application workloads

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,780
will be hosted in the cloud.

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,813
That's the vision that's,
organizations have.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,107
So, what we want is

23
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:06,600
all the applications to be
delivered in an agile way

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,250
to be faster than our competitors

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,783
and for that cloud to scale,

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,750
so that's, we only pay for
what we need in clouds.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,380
And ultimately we want to

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,289
all of those on-premise data centers

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,603
all that legacy
infrastructure to disappear.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,590
But today only 20% of the
workloads that are on-premise

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,800
have been moved to clouds.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,220
So we've got a long way to go.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,580
But one of the things that's stopping us

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,523
is the protection of data.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
As we bring that data into
cloud, what's happening is

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,180
we're correlating and
consolidating that data together.

37
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,710
The value of the data goes up and also

38
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:56,320
the bots, the organization
can get out of that data

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,009
in terms of the insights
is also increasing.

40
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,460
But as the value increases
to the organization

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,860
becomes more critical to the
operation of the organization.

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,810
It also means that the hackers
the threat actors out there

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,950
also are willing to spend more time

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,730
they're spending months may maybe

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,367
a year trying to get in
and go and get that data.

46
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,470
And what we've seen from the
SolarWinds breaches is that

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,940
they spent, they came
in and September, 2019

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,980
the breach was discovered
in December, 2020.

49
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,910
So they have quite a while

50
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,350
getting access to the
data in organizations.

51
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,500
And we still don't know

52
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:41,370
the full impact of that today.

53
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,023
So protecting data becomes
more and more important.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,130
So we have a lot of challenges

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,299
in trying to protect that data.

56
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
What we're finding is that

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,280
organizations are very resistant to move

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,963
very sensitive data to cloud,

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,549
because they have a concern that,

60
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,303
that data will not be
protected in the right way.

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,880
And so what do we need to do

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,109
to protect data sufficiently in cloud?

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,210
Well, we need to encrypt it.

64
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,603
Well, we all told that,

65
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:19,180
but we also need that
encryption to be effective.

66
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,860
We need it to be trusted and we need it,

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,260
that's encryption and key
management infrastructure to be

68
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,750
resilient in particular
because that infrastructure

69
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,523
is needed to make that data available.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,340
So what do we mean by

71
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,460
encryption needs to be effective,
trusted, and resilient?

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,820
Well, to be effective,

73
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,090
we need to go and think
about our normal CIA triad,

74
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,290
confidentiality, integrity
and availability.

75
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,130
And we think that the
way of doing that is just

76
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,290
will encrypt at rest.

77
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,530
And that's the simple
answer that's, in clouds.

78
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,030
But unfortunately that
doesn't solve the problem.

79
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,630
And I'll talk about, more
about the risks as we move on.

80
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,930
We also need that
infrastructure to be trusted

81
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,670
because cloud is multi-tenants,

82
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,530
it's shared between other people.

83
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,897
And if there's a
vulnerability in that data

84
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:16,262
our data may leak to other clients.

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,500
And if the key management infrastructure

86
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,459
the encryption infrastructure,

87
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,159
is not trusted maybe some other client

88
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,913
can get access to our keys
and get access to our data.

89
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,840
So it needs to be trusted.

90
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,909
And finally it needs to be resilient

91
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,800
because the keys that you store
as part of that encryption

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,370
are stored centrally.

93
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,310
And if you give somebody
access to both the primary keys

94
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,740
and you give them access
to the backups as well

95
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,270
and if you were to lose all of those keys

96
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,036
you lose all your data.

97
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,550
An organization doesn't
exist at that point

98
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,223
because an organization relies on data.

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,233
So we need it to be effective,
trusted, and resilient.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,620
So what we're going to do is talk through

101
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,279
sets of risks, five risks that

102
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,230
I think you should be thinking about.

103
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to talk about some
architectural principles

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,050
two principles that I
suggest you start with.

105
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,870
I'm sure you're gonna
come up with many others.

106
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,060
I'm gonna talk about the cloud

107
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,980
basic components of both
on-premise and cloud.

108
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,200
So that will help you

109
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,409
to understand how, what
those components are

110
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,840
and how you can use them.

111
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,489
I'll also talk about,
then build up a series

112
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,510
of encryption and key management patterns

113
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,510
that will take you from using
cloud managing on-premise

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,960
from the cloud

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,280
and then eventually removing
your on-premise data centers.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,059
So we're gonna talk through that.

117
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,760
Now throughout the session,

118
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,060
if you have any questions,

119
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,560
please put that into the chats

120
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,772
and I'll be answering through throughout.

121
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,640
And then at the end, we're
gonna talk about what's next?

122
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,483
What can you do with the
outcome of this session?

123
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,190
So talking about the first risk.

124
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,910
Well, the first risk that
people are thinking about is

125
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,510
loss of that storage the
physical or virtual storage.

126
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,289
So if the disks were pulled
out of the system in the cloud,

127
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,260
or the virtual server was
moved to another clouds,

128
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,700
just copied, could I
make use of that data?

129
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,710
Could it get access to it?

130
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,849
Or the storage was reused by another

131
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,710
person, another user of the cloud.

132
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,710
So on what we do is we
encrypt at rest the storage

133
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,580
and what we try to do is use our own keys

134
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,919
so that even the cloud provider

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,293
couldn't get access to
the data in the cloud.

136
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,603
But that doesn't fix the second risk.

137
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,630
It doesn't fix the second risk
because you're thinking about

138
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,423
disclosure or modification
of that data in the cloud.

139
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,890
So what we're going to do is,

140
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,370
what we need to do is think about,

141
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,440
well, if I'm a privileged user

142
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,310
or I'm a hacker getting onto the system

143
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,180
who's a privileged user, I
still have access to that data.

144
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,370
So what we need to do

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,710
is to be able to encrypt
the structured data

146
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,169
that's sitting in the database

147
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,120
or we need to encrypt the structured data

148
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,110
unstructured data, sitting
on the file system.

149
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,810
So, and that's all about
protecting for privileged users

150
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,490
and really the inside of risk.

151
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,710
So there is no need for
you as a privileged user

152
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,289
to get access to that data

153
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,773
and potentially to go
and disclose that data.

154
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,900
Next, we have three other risks.

155
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,750
They're all related to resilience.

156
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,750
So the infrastructure that
we've got needs to be resilient

157
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,885
because if I lose all the
keys, I lose my business.

158
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:02,440
So that's a risk three.

159
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,860
The second one is more
about, okay, so I'm resilient

160
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,800
but if I want to recover
that infrastructure

161
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,790
is it going to take five
minutes, two hours, or two days?

162
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,620
So we still need, a route to
recover that infrastructure

163
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,860
in a timely manner.

164
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,143
And if we have the infrastructure
spread, for example,

165
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,360
the HSMs that I'm gonna talk about,

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
if they're on-premise and your encryption

167
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,360
is in the cloud you've got to ensure that,

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
that's connectivity between
the two different locations

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,539
is in place.

170
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,849
And if we can remove that dependency

171
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,909
then we can remove the amount of time

172
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,910
that's needed to recover
in the event of a disaster.

173
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
So it's another thing to think about.

174
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,750
And finally, what's in certain markets,

175
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,670
particularly in financial services,

176
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,646
the regulators are
concerned that the data is,

177
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:02,580
and the services are all going towards

178
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,960
one or two clouds vendors.

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Now, if that cloud vendor fails,

180
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,579
then a significant part of the

181
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,640
financial services market fails

182
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,580
and there is a significant risk to

183
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,729
the overall economy of a country.

184
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,730
So what they're trying
to do is to make sure

185
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,500
that there is a spread of
risk around the industry.

186
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,380
And as things change over time, they want

187
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,319
the financial services organizations

188
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,210
to be able to move that data rapidly

189
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,370
without compromising our data.

190
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,030
So leaving it encrypted

191
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,510
and moving it from one cloud to another.

192
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,770
So those are the five risks

193
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,870
we're going to talk about in this session.

194
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,700
So let's think about the
two architectural principles

195
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,200
that I'd like to go and cover.

196
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,550
At the bottom of this stack

197
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,930
you'll see different levels of encryption.

198
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,810
At the bottom, you'll see
encryption of storage.

199
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,119
Normally there are hard disks there,

200
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
self-encrypting drives that are very fast

201
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:12,429
and really happen as a part
of the cloud infrastructure.

202
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,670
The one that's more interesting probably

203
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,939
to you is the volume of block storage

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,380
because that's normally has,

205
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,610
can be used the key of the client,

206
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,163
that's using that cloud infrastructure.

207
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,369
I still very fast,

208
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,143
it's two or 5% of the
overall CPU of the cloud,

209
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,440
but it allows you to use your own keys.

210
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,150
So that's, even if that's,
the VMs or the storage

211
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,640
was moved elsewhere the
cloud provider doesn't

212
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,283
and anybody else doesn't
have access to that data.

213
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,170
And it's very fast,

214
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,120
so that meets

215
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,740
mitigates risk one that
we talked about earlier,

216
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,090
it's high performance

217
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,770
and we recommend that
you encrypt low and broad

218
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,400
which means you encrypt everything,

219
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,870
because it's just easy, you
turn the keys and it works

220
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,430
because everything's encrypted.

221
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,069
It has no impact on the applications

222
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,290
because it's transparent

223
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,250
and it does have some
operational impacts in terms of

224
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,810
restoring for backups, because
you have to think about,

225
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,642
well how I

226
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,520
do the backups now, how do I restore them

227
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,220
back to the same states, if
I want an individual file,

228
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:35,740
but it really has a low
impact in terms of operations.

229
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,750
Now, if we want to do with risk two,

230
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,450
we want to encrypt the files
or the folders to prevent

231
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:45,699
the privileged users from
getting access to that data.

232
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,733
But the problem is that,

233
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:49,877
if I've got thousand files,

234
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,926
I might end up with a thousand keys

235
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,960
and that's a lot of keys to go and manage.

236
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,740
And when you build an infrastructure

237
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,260
with tens of thousands of servers

238
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,860
and millions of files and millions of,

239
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,210
perhaps databases, not
millions of database,

240
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,060
but hundreds of databases, but

241
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,780
you're building large infrastructures

242
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,870
you're gonna end up with
a large number of keys.

243
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,740
So what you tend to do is

244
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,700
do this follow the second
principle that says

245
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,470
encrypt selectively.

246
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,670
So what you will do is

247
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,300
only encrypt the data

248
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,186
existing in files and
databases that really are,

249
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,573
have an impact.

250
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,420
They have sensitive data
in terms of personal data

251
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,040
or they have a high impact
in terms of disclosure.

252
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,750
So, and that's,

253
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,053
prevents privileged users
from getting access.

254
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,449
And what you want to do is limit it

255
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,570
to the real critical data because

256
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,130
that will have an overhead
in terms of the management.

257
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,947
So you don't want to,

258
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,490
if the cost of managing encryption exceeds

259
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,000
the cost of the value
of the data, then you,

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,780
you probably shouldn't be doing it.

261
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,240
And finally, at the top
level, we've got applications.

262
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,570
So we'll find, again, financial
services we're back to that.

263
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,730
They often encrypt specific
financial services transactions.

264
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,663
So that's a high level as well.

265
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,500
So let's think about the architecture

266
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,653
for the encryption and
key management system.

267
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,933
In on-premise, we traditionally
have three components

268
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,460
we will have a hardware security module.

269
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,910
We'll have key manager and
an encryption capability

270
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,160
that does the encryption.

271
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,300
In the HSM, we have a master key,

272
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,550
that master key can never leave the HSM.

273
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,030
The only way of making
use of that master key

274
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,762
is to go and send a key
or data to that HSM.

275
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,820
And that's how we have a
trusted infrastructure.

276
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,723
So that HSM

277
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,060
is the core of the
encryption infrastructure.

278
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,270
So we can guarantee that

279
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,500
no individual can get access
to the encryption keys

280
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,050
and therefore encrypt the data.

281
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,690
We have the key management server

282
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,320
that will contain key encryption keys.

283
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,730
So the key encryption
keys that are stored there

284
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,650
are all encrypted using the master key

285
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,992
that's sitting in the HSM,

286
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,503
and we will have an encryption capability,

287
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,230
it could be a storage subsystem,

288
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,570
it could be something

289
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,080
that encrypted files
folders, databases, and so on

290
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,940
piece of software

291
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,119
and that will contain
the data encryption key

292
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,063
which we encrypted using
the key encryption key

293
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,603
that sitting in the key management server.

294
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,780
And we tend to go and use
this mechanic protocol

295
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,410
between the encryption capability

296
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,990
and the key management server,

297
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,339
and we use PKCS #11 between
the key management server

298
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,339
and the HSM.

299
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,970
So those are standard industry protocols.

300
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,870
So when we want to start things up

301
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,110
the key encryption capability says,

302
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,390
right I've got an encrypted
data encryption key,

303
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,350
I need to decrypt it,

304
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,700
so can you send me the key encryption key

305
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,710
from the key management server?

306
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,000
The key management server says

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,840
I only have an encrypted copy.

308
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,190
So I'm going to send that
encrypted copy to the HSM,

309
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,053
to decrypt it.

310
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,420
HSM will send back an
un-encrypted key encryption key,

311
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,800
that will be forwarded to
the encryption capability

312
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,260
which will decrypt the
data encryption key.

313
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,330
And now you can start decrypting data

314
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,910
and this series of
dependencies becomes a problem

315
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,300
when you want to go and
start things up, because,

316
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,199
you've got to have that
communication in place

317
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,970
that key encryption key

318
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,190
or any keys that are un-encrypted

319
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,140
are never stored on storage,
so they can never be recovered

320
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,240
that only a memory, so if you powered off,

321
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,382
you can't get access to them.

322
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:51,590
So that sequence is
the on-premise sequence

323
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,353
and is used for encrypting data.

324
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,140
Now in cloud it's a little different

325
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,020
in that the key management server

326
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,840
and HSM are combined together.

327
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,710
You end up with a rest API

328
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,890
that recovers that key encryption key

329
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,250
and that key management
server is multi-tenant.

330
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,080
So each used for multiple clients

331
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,963
and you have to trust that the event,

332
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,898
the cloud service provider,

333
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,010
that the software

334
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,920
they've created,

335
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,053
does not disclose your
keys to another client.

336
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,100
And it's not sufficient to go and say,

337
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,223
oh, hand on hearts, I'm not
gonna go and hand the keys over.

338
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:41,114
We need a way of technically
protecting the master key.

339
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,860
And so we'll go and talk a bit about

340
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,603
how we can do that in cloud.

341
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,940
So now we've got the components

342
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,940
we'll move on and talk
about the security pattern

343
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,130
or the architectural pattern.

344
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,510
So we talked about the
cloud key manager in cloud

345
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,360
it's multi-tenant

346
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,343
and it will be used to
encrypt objects, block,

347
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,390
VMs or hypervisors,

348
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,160
encrypt address data encryption at rest.

349
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,270
That meets the requirement for risk one,

350
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,520
what it doesn't do is protect the data

351
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,583
from disclosure to privileged users.

352
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,572
It also,

353
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,430
in cloud, we tend to go
and have multiple clouds.

354
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,280
So you'll have multiple clouds.

355
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,370
You might have Azure

356
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,110
for a directory service.

357
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,909
You might have IBM cloud to go and run

358
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,090
some other capabilities

359
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,290
and you're going to
integrate them together.

360
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,740
And sometimes you'll then have

361
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,130
key managers in those different clouds,

362
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,233
and they each use what they
call bring your own key.

363
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,650
And the interfaces they have really

364
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,030
allow you to load up the key as a whole.

365
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,590
What it doesn't do is allow
you to load up the key

366
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,470
parts of a key, and it
doesn't allow you to store

367
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,770
the master key in an HSM or
in a trusted infrastructure.

368
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,470
So what we tend to do is
actually use a what's called

369
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,983
a multi-cloud key manager.

370
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,880
And a multi-cloud key manager

371
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,100
will enable you to go and load up keys

372
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,330
into each of the, bring your
own key, infrastructure.

373
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,100
So there is no person involved

374
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,020
who can actually see the
keys that are being loaded.

375
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,170
Behind that multi-cloud key manager

376
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,660
is perhaps another key manager that will

377
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,490
have access to an HSM,

378
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,330
that HSM has a trustee path

379
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,780
that has been initialized and setup

380
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,230
using multiple key parts,

381
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,410
it's using tokens,

382
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,210
it's using various other
key ceremony controls

383
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:58,060
to have a trusted HSM in
an on-premise data center.

384
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,429
But really that helps us
managing multiple keys

385
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:03,800
as we move to cloud,

386
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,970
but there are two problems here.

387
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,010
One is, we've now got this
connection back to on-premise

388
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,990
which if we want to recover the cloud

389
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,993
potentially is a problem, or
we want to recover things,

390
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,170
and also we're locked
into using on-premise.

391
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,760
So we can never get off on-premise.

392
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,400
We can never get fully moved to cloud.

393
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,393
So how do we overcome that problem?

394
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,210
Well, what we'll do is

395
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,010
we'll have a single
tenant cloud key manager,

396
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,050
that cloud key manager
uses an HSM partition

397
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,050
fips 140-2 level 4 HSM

398
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,210
and you have access to that partition

399
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,150
using two sets of smartcards.

400
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,157
Set of smartcards are there to
authenticate you to the HSM.

401
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:54,670
And those smartcards mean that

402
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,030
multiple people have to be
part of that key ceremony.

403
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,854
And you'll have a set of smartcards

404
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:01,090
that whole parts of the keys.

405
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,010
So there might be three sets of key

406
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,100
cards and they each have to
go and be brought together

407
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,550
and by multiple people to go actually

408
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,983
go and initialize that HSM partition.

409
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,160
So now you have this trusty path

410
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,930
to get to an HSM in the cloud,

411
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,400
and only you can get to that HSM partition

412
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,480
and the assurance from the fips 140-2

413
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,010
goes and provide some assurance, that's

414
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,510
nobody else can get to
that because that's part of

415
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,960
the solution has been tested.

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,700
So the other part is
the cloud key manager.

417
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,640
Now that's normally multi-tenant,

418
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,230
but if we have a dedicated
one in a process that

419
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,660
you can't touch and you
can't remotely log in to it

420
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,740
nobody can get access
to it except through the

421
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,490
to reconfigure it, except
through your smartcards,

422
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,950
we now have a trusted
cloud key manager as well.

423
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,030
So now we've overcome the problem where

424
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,840
we don't need an HSM on-premise

425
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,763
because we have a trusted
part to our cloud HSM.

426
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,970
So that builds up that picture.

427
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,330
Now we still haven't dealt with

428
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,340
risk two which is how do I deal with

429
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,520
the privileged threat actors?

430
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,520
So we need a way of encrypting
files and folders databases.

431
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,419
So we need a way of doing that.

432
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,900
So the way in which we do that

433
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,370
is to add an encryption manager

434
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,613
the encryption manager,

435
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,600
can supply keys, like
a key manager as well,

436
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,990
but also has an agent
for files and folders.

437
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,640
And those files and
folders can be encrypted,

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,290
so that even if you're a privileged user

439
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,023
you have no access to
that data on the system.

440
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,440
So that's a core components

441
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,840
and you probably want multiple protocols

442
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,730
because you want KMIP that
was gonna go and deal with the

443
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,220
most of the infrastructures and
DPAPI which is the Microsoft

444
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,810
protocol that allows you
to encrypt things like

445
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,550
SQL databases and do
other things like that.

446
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,620
So that encryption manager now

447
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,449
is there with a multi-cloud key manager

448
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,730
and an HSM that has a trusty path with

449
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,710
a single-tenant cloud key manager.

450
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,740
You now have a solution

451
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,180
that enables you

452
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,163
to go and manage all the
components in the clouds.

453
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,180
So one of the challenges then is, well,

454
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,853
I've got to go and move to other clouds.

455
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,159
I've got to go and move
my data potentially

456
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,460
from one cloud to another.

457
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:45,640
And that was the exit problem.

458
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,930
So if I encrypt my data in one cloud

459
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,250
as a database, and I've got
multi terabytes of a database

460
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,336
I don't really want to decrypt it

461
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,480
because it's gonna take a
very long time to decrypt it.

462
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,793
And when I move it,

463
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,530
there's gonna be a risk that
is disclosed to somebody else.

464
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,560
So by using encryption manager

465
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,230
I can actually move the
data fully encrypted

466
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,300
and then pick it up in encryption manager

467
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,270
and then just use it as I
did before on the cloud.

468
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,590
So I could move my data from clouds

469
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,590
or from on-premise into cloud.

470
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,342
So that solves that risk two.

471
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,889
But I'm still moving my
applications to cloud.

472
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,440
And I still,

473
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,140
only 20% has moved to cloud,

474
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,370
so there's quite a lot more to do.

475
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,199
And so I've still got storage
sitting in the data center.

476
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,010
I've still got data that
I want to encrypt there

477
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,260
and then move.

478
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,360
So what I can do is I can
use that encryption manager

479
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,803
to encrypt the storage, the
storage subsystems I'm using,

480
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,490
so it could be NetApp or IBM, for example

481
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,240
it's used quite a few places

482
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
or and also the files or folders

483
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,720
that sitting on that
storage I can encrypt.

484
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,560
And now I, when I'm ready

485
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,620
even though it's a multi-terabyte database

486
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,949
I can copy that as a whole,
without decrypting it to cloud.

487
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,803
So I now have my control plane on cloud.

488
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,480
So that's the architecture as a whole

489
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,210
that meets the five risks that
we're trying to talk about

490
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,530
and gives us the journey to go and move

491
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,330
from on-premise and colo,
support multiple clouds,

492
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,750
meet the different risks in terms of

493
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,900
you've got the risk one in terms of

494
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,340
the storage and virtual image
encryption, which is fast

495
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,382
and I've got selective
encryption for risk two

496
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:41,120
have databases and storage.

497
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,959
So that's the complete architecture.

498
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,250
So how does that change the components

499
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,150
that we talked about at the beginning?

500
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,030
So what we've effectively
done is we've combined

501
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,287
the on-premise components into the cloud.

502
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,680
It's enabling us to go and
make use of the clouds,

503
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,617
single-tenant HSM.

504
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:09,610
And now we have a way of,

505
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,082
using those components
and bring them together.

506
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:16,043
Both with KMIP interfaces,
PKCS 11, if you want that,

507
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:19,090
and the rest APIs which tend to be

508
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,990
specific proprietary to each cloud.

509
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,650
So we also, and that's
why you also need to use

510
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,210
some other mechanism other than the cloud

511
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,770
mechanism to move data around

512
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,370
because of that proprietary
nature of the rest APIs.

513
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,670
But there is a benefit
in using that, as I said

514
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,133
because of speed and dependencies.

515
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,092
So let's talk about resilience.

516
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,530
So we talked about the last,

517
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,080
the third risk was about resilient.

518
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,500
If we lost that infrastructure,

519
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,450
we would

520
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,460
we still have to be able to
recover that infrastructure.

521
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,793
Even if we lost a multi
zone region, even if,

522
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,920
a single component or zone went down,

523
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,870
we still have to go

524
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:12,200
and have a resilient infrastructure.

525
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,390
So what we tend to do is
have a cloud key manager

526
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,820
that's resilient between an HSMs

527
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,669
that are resilient between the zones

528
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,220
and the key databases that
are stored within that

529
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,320
for the cloud key services,

530
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,453
I synchronized in real time.

531
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:30,660
And when we start that
cloud key manager up

532
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,520
will you be using the smartcards
to go and load the keys up?

533
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,810
So if I ever lost the whole MCR

534
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,629
I still have the key
sitting on the smart cards

535
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,463
and could load them up.

536
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:43,030
And in fact, I could preload those keys

537
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,030
into another MCR and actually
set up key managements

538
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,173
in another MCR.

539
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,939
What we also do is we
back up the keys offline

540
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,297
to object storage or somewhere else.

541
00:26:57,297 --> 00:27:00,770
And we can do that either
at a regular interval

542
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,460
or a one-off when we
want to go and back it up

543
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,810
perhaps we've done a re-key,

544
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,860
we've changed all the
keys in infrastructure

545
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,280
and we want to do a
backup directly after that

546
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,903
for risk purposes.

547
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,260
And then for the encryption manager

548
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,220
does the same capability
of synchronizing the keys

549
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,380
between the different
infrastructures so that

550
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,550
I can actually move my workloads

551
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,790
and between those different zones.

552
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,899
And again, you have to
think about scheduled

553
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:29,928
and adult backups as
part of that solution.

554
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,660
So that's how we build resilience,

555
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,410
and we build the resilience, so that's,

556
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,750
even if there is an MCR failure,
we have a way of recovering

557
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,932
the infrastructure and
decrypting the data.

558
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,343
So finally,

559
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,490
what have you learned today?

560
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,050
I hope you that was useful

561
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,050
and gives you plenty of thoughts,
continue to ask questions.

562
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,840
But what I'm looking for you
to do is to go and think about

563
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,610
your current encryption and
key management solution.

564
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,370
Do any of the things that
I've talked about resonates

565
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,362
and does that solution meet those,

566
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,719
support mitigating those
five risks I've talked about

567
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,880
particularly the second risk is,

568
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,620
it's not just encryption of data at rest

569
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,370
it's encryption of data,
files, folders, databases

570
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,449
things that, so they are
doing it in such a way

571
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,900
that the privileged users
can't get access to it.

572
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,090
So while you're thinking about that

573
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,570
perhaps update your strategy
in the next three months

574
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,860
and therefore you can have a roadmap to

575
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,159
better mitigating the
risks I've talked about,

576
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,129
evaluate the cloud solutions
the other solutions

577
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,000
that can actually implement
this sort of architecture

578
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,340
and close the gaps.

579
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
So that's important.

580
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,930
But it's not just
thinking about technology.

581
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,330
What's the impact to the organization?

582
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,149
What's the impact to the team,

583
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,950
that's going to manage the keys?

584
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,880
And what I've seen is that,

585
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,800
often people will implement the technology

586
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,610
but they don't have insufficient people

587
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,240
to run the key ceremonies

588
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
or that all the people that
run the key ceremonies resign

589
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,363
and they've got no way of
recovering the infrastructure.

590
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,300
And so thinking about the
whole management regime

591
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,720
the skills of the people

592
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,160
and if they only perform those ceremonies

593
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,130
those key ceremonies very frequently

594
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,740
they might not know how to
do it in six months time.

595
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,363
So how do you keep the skills fresh?

596
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,110
So think about those sorts of things.

597
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,460
And hopefully within six months,

598
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,120
you've thought about
right, okay, I've got,

599
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,000
I know what the solution is.

600
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,270
I've got plan

601
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,050
and I'm starting to
implement and close the gaps.

602
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,000
And this is not just thinking
about what you've got today

603
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,920
but it's understanding
the overall cloud strategy

604
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,500
that your organization has

605
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,290
and how do you support them so that,

606
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,250
security is not the
delay for going to cloud.

607
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,220
It's an enabler.

608
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,810
So having that security

609
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,120
or having that encryption
and key management

610
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,362
software in place is an enabler.

611
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,629
So thank you for your time today.

612
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,920
And if you, as I said, if
you've got any questions

613
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,960
please put them in the chat,

614
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,413
I'll be here to answer them
after the session as well.

615
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,393
Thank you.
