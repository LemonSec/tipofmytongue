00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,400
- Hi, I'm Laura Koetzle,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,087
and welcome to Adapt To
The New Unstable Normal:

3
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:09,230
How To Secure The Roaring 2020s.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,260
I'm the head of European
Research for Forrester,

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,640
but I'm also a cybersecurity
research analyst

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,884
by trade and training.

7
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:19,500
And I'm lucky enough to be a
member of the advisory board

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,720
and the program committee
for RSA Conference.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,041
So I'd welcome your feedback,
not just on this session

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,439
but on the whole track and
indeed on conference as a whole.

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,360
So to set the stage
for this session a bit,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,060
this is one of our big picture sessions

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,330
for the securing the
remote workforce track.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm going to endeavor to talk

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,190
about not just what we need to think about

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,458
for the next six months to a year

17
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:44,250
but rather for the entire decade.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,289
So hence the roaring 2020s.

19
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,990
And to that end strange as it may be,

20
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,468
the benefits of virtual are
that I can take questions

21
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,460
in the chat while the virtual
meet is actually presenting.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,300
So feel free to ask me your questions

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,180
or give me your feedback
indeed the entire time

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,563
as opposed to at the very end.

25
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,468
So with all the housekeeping done

26
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,649
let's talk about the roaring 2020s

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,870
which of course brings
to mind images like this.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,560
So I personally cannot wait to dance

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,689
in front of the US Capitol,

30
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,356
albeit I understand there's
some fencing there now

31
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,919
or in Dam Square here in Amsterdam,

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,460
a little closer to where I live.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,529
Once cases are finally down enough

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,810
and the restrictions are lifted

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,780
and we're actually allowed
to be less than one

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,621
and a half meters from
the next person over.

37
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,871
And because this has been such
a difficult 15-ish months,

38
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:37,479
I definitely expect a bunch of
1920s style decadent partying

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,505
once that's allowed.

40
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:42,437
But post 2021, sadly the roaring 2020s

41
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,127
are gonna be a little less Gatsby

42
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:47,550
and a lot more adaptation to up swellings

43
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,009
of systemic risk as it were.

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,680
And that's not just future pandemics grim

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,434
as it is to think about
those given where we are now.

46
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,880
But also geopolitical risk,

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,220
climate risk sort of risk
and domestic politics

48
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,429
wherever you are, social
unrest, et cetera.

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,900
The next decade for all of
us in information security

50
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,420
this is not a change is indeed
going to be a may you live

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,329
in interesting times kind of thing.

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,066
So if you enjoy interesting,
this is the decade for you.

53
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,156
So but on the positive side, right?

54
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,330
All of us spent the last 15 months,

55
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,650
drawing a lot of very
scary exponential graphs.

56
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,950
And this though is a positive graph

57
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,000
in which lines go up into the right.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,030
So a vaccination graph instead
of a case and death graph,

59
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,620
like the ones we spend up spent lots

60
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,183
of time looking at over the past year.

61
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:41,170
So really exciting to
see these lines going

62
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,003
up into the right.

63
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:43,456
And let's keep that in mind

64
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,512
as we think about kind of where we are,

65
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,848
and where we're going
over the next decade.

66
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:51,610
So in addition to lots of scary

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,840
and now actually hopeful graphs.

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,160
The last 15 months have brought us kind of

69
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,120
an explosioning and an expansion

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,760
to the universe of the possible.

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,744
So hence my big bang picture here

72
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,970
because in addition to the
human and economic toll

73
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,638
of the pandemic over the last 15 months,

74
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:13,900
we've also made radical
changes to all sorts of things.

75
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,180
We did things that were previously thought

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,519
of as just downright impossible

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,519
or indeed vanishingly difficult
because we had no choice.

78
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,770
And so our challenge now is
to sort through those changes

79
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,790
and figure out which will
stay, which will change

80
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,827
which we wanna keep,
which we wanna get rid of.

81
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,857
And of course, because
this is RSA Conference

82
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,242
how to secure them.

83
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,609
So to that end, I'm gonna
describe all of these

84
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,640
in terms of five pandemic connected shifts

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,661
that we at Forrester think
are going to change business

86
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:49,050
and technology forever, which
sounds like a pretty big claim

87
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,990
but hopefully I'll show you
that it's not an overblown one.

88
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,010
And again, as I said, because
this is RSA Conference,

89
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,920
I'm gonna talk about how to secure those.

90
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,760
So I will tackle those five
pandemic connected shifts

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,340
in three broad timeframes.

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,950
And you know apologies for the kind

93
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,209
of quadratic-ness of this,
but just bear with me.

94
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,073
Here are the three timeframes

95
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:10,620
we'll consider those shifts in.

96
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,280
So the short term, which
is the next 18 months,

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,392
which is the kind of big lift
on sort of vaccinating people

98
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:20,730
and getting the virus out
of our proverbial systems.

99
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,410
And then medium term, which is
18 months through five years.

100
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,597
And then the long term,
which is five years

101
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,169
and beyond through the rest of the decade.

102
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,000
So what are those five shifts?

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,140
Let's talk about.

104
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,534
So in the first place, we've
got customer expectations

105
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:38,989
that will shift on the spectrum
of safety and convenience.

106
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:42,229
Businesses that be riding
the digital engagement wave

107
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,640
that we've had with the
changes in the pandemic

108
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,229
to create hybrid experiences.

109
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,250
Firms and governments
are gonna be investing

110
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,099
in the once thought impossible

111
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:54,454
to drive the future of
work forward differently.

112
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,882
And smart companies are gonna
retire technical debt quickly

113
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,310
and then ride the tech disruption wave.

114
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,060
And finally a boom for all of us

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,146
in the general world of
information security and privacy.

116
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,940
Business resiliency is going

117
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,483
to become a competitive
advantage, not just for us

118
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:13,110
but for our companies
and our organizations

119
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,130
and indeed for the world as a whole.

120
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,710
So let's tackle that first shift first.

121
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,870
So customer expectations will be shifting

122
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,815
on the spectrum of safety and convenience.

123
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:25,590
And here's what that means
across those three timeframes.

124
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,133
In the short term, consumer risk aversion

125
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,539
and desire for convenience
are going to co-exist.

126
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,711
And what this will result in

127
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,750
is a lot of behavior the
books really contradictory.

128
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,283
So to give one example,

129
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:42,760
most US and Italian consumer say

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,320
that they're gonna try to avoid crowds

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,558
for the next 24 months,

132
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:51,770
but at the same time 48%
of online adults in Italy

133
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,120
and 40% of those in the
US wanna return to stores

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,380
and shop normally as soon as possible.

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,414
Those two things are
completely contradictory,

136
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:02,430
but it reflects not bad
survey design on our part,

137
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,457
at least I don't think so,

138
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:06,341
but genuine conflict in consumers.

139
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,650
And if you think about
how you yourself feel,

140
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,063
you'll probably see some of that conflict

141
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,563
in yourself as well.

142
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:15,840
In the medium term, empowered
consumers are gonna vote

143
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,176
for values with their wallets.

144
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,650
So what I mean by this is that

145
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,674
as kind of employment recovers,

146
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,410
economies recover post-pandemic

147
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,510
'cause we should say a post-pandemic boom.

148
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,121
If we do this right in a lot of places

149
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,924
consumers will have personal power again.

150
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:35,380
And they're gonna use that
personal power to kind of act

151
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,474
on the things they thought about a lot

152
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:39,950
while they were stuck at home
during the pandemic namely,

153
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,941
what kind of companies,

154
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,409
what kind of products do I
want to invest my money in

155
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,909
that support the causes that I believe in,

156
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,767
whether that be
environmental sustainability

157
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,690
or investment in the local community

158
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,183
or supporting various kinds of
particular causes, et cetera.

159
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,710
And so consumers are gonna
be directing their spending

160
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,912
even more than before to brands

161
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:02,760
that they trust that connect
them to those values.

162
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,108
And finally in the long
term, choice of experience

163
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,368
is gonna become the new
luxury status symbol.

164
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:12,020
So the pandemic accelerated
digital adoption unbelievable

165
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,051
because we had no choice.

166
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:16,609
And as companies use their physical spaces

167
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:20,849
to opened up stores,
stadiums, car showrooms,

168
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,350
et cetera, et cetera, in new ways

169
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,025
and limit the access to
those physical spaces

170
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,628
in kind of future pandemic
or other types of situations.

171
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,830
You will have only
consumers who can pay for

172
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,500
that sort of value of being
in that physical space

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,920
who have access to it.

174
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
And you'll also see things

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,600
like consumers who lack the rights

176
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,210
to their data statutorily.

177
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,859
So I live in the European union.

178
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,360
So I have a whole bunch
of statutory rights

179
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,570
to my personal data.

180
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,272
Plenty of you do in your
jurisdictions as well,

181
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,680
but there are plenty of
places where you don't.

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,760
And so consumers will be
using sophisticated tools

183
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,031
to make sure that they limit their data

184
00:07:57,031 --> 00:08:00,830
and the access to it to
providers that they trust.

185
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,979
So what does that mean for security?

186
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,580
So let's talk short,
medium, and long here.

187
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,050
So in the short term,

188
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,540
we'll need to secure no-touch
customer experiences.

189
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,340
So the pandemic has
brought a ton of innovation

190
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,659
in making experiences sort
of less physical contact,

191
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,990
so that they're less risky.

192
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,535
So one of my favorites is the
car company Geely in China

193
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,694
was delivering keys to new
cars to customers by drone

194
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,550
as the customer stood on their balcony.

195
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,130
So a drone fly up to them,
give them their keys.

196
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,610
And there's all kinds of
other stuff like that.

197
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,440
Like a sort of one use
disposable button pushers

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,470
and stuff like that.

199
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,010
So all of us in security needs
to secure those experiences

200
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,530
because they increase our attack surface.

201
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,510
If your keys are flying
around with drones,

202
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,380
all of a sudden that's the
thing you have to secure

203
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,969
that you probably never considered before.

204
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,743
Secondly, we have to invest

205
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,877
in non-creepy anti-fraud techniques

206
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,400
because you've got a bunch of consumers

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,233
who've gone digital.

208
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,969
So older consumers people

209
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,700
who just preferred physical channels

210
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,756
who like digital,

211
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,920
but they're just less
used to different kinds

212
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,630
of fraud detection and sort
of those kinds of things.

213
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,497
And so we have to make
those techniques more kind

214
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:10,660
of amenable to them as well.

215
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,500
And lastly, something fun
for our privacy friends

216
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,240
is that their budgets are growing.

217
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,580
Based on all of the survey
work that we've done in 2020.

218
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,395
They doubled their privacy
budgets on average.

219
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:23,010
And in 2021 only 7% of
respondents are expecting

220
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,870
to reduce that.

221
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,008
So they've got more
funding, so work together.

222
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,604
Secondly, in the medium term,

223
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,860
we're gonna need to build provenance

224
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,670
and sustainability
verification stuff that scales.

225
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,069
So consumers voting with their values,

226
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,110
means if we conform to those values,

227
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,930
we need to be able to show that we do.

228
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,266
And so that's gonna mean things

229
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,155
that are not very long questionnaires.

230
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,270
That will eventually be
blockchain chain based solutions

231
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,470
for this that work.

232
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,644
So kind of look out for
those and test them.

233
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:54,160
And we also need to rework
our application security

234
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
to handle adaptive technology.

235
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,034
So by adaptive technology, I
mean stuff for accessibility.

236
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,830
So those older and previously physical,

237
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,416
only consumers and indeed consumers

238
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,680
with various kinds of limitations

239
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
both physical, visual, et cetera.

240
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,620
We'll also be using digital more.

241
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,660
And so it turns out that a lot

242
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,742
of our applications security
tools see the scripting

243
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:19,048
of clicks that adaptive
technology for consumers

244
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,930
who have trouble using mice

245
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,530
with computers looks
exactly like bot activity

246
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,900
to application security tools
for just to use one example.

247
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,560
So all of us and our UX design friends

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,469
are gonna have to take that into account

249
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,729
as we secure these new
kinds of experiences

250
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:37,030
with new consumers.

251
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,480
And in the long term, we're
all gonna need to integrate

252
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,547
with those customer data lockers

253
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,100
that I was talking about earlier,

254
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,259
where consumers control
the release of their data

255
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,787
to you in very tangible ways.

256
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:51,204
And we also need to build
security and privacy controls

257
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:54,489
that translate seamlessly
between the physical

258
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,871
and the digital realm and back.

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,770
Because we're gonna have people moving

260
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,174
through those hybrid
experiences that we talked about

261
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:03,425
and also those kinds of
experience driven physical venues,

262
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:06,670
like that sort of complete
surround stadium experience

263
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,472
that we've seen so much about and so on.

264
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:11,665
So that's how to secure the
stuff from the first shift.

265
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,760
Now let's talk about the second shift.

266
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,439
So businesses are going to ride
the digital engagement wave

267
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,949
to create hybrid experiences.

268
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,358
So let's break that down across
those three timeframes again

269
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,720
and then we'll talk
about how to secure them.

270
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,030
So in the short-term that first 18 months,

271
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,415
an initial wave of new experiences
rolled out pretty quickly

272
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,110
are gonna compromise
customer experience quality.

273
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,569
So as businesses have
operated under a whole bunch

274
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,579
of constraints, they've rolled out a load

275
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,790
of digital experiences of
varying levels of quality.

276
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,730
And so consumers are eventually
going to stop being tolerant

277
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,563
of that.

278
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:49,449
There was a certain amount

279
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,596
of, okay, it's a pandemic, I get it.

280
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:56,370
But as consumers wish to continue
to use those experiences,

281
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,900
you're gonna have to make
sure that they actually scale

282
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,333
and work properly and indeed
deliver the emotional resonance

283
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,969
of the in-person experiences that a lot

284
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,463
of these consumers use before.

285
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:09,175
In the medium term, a new breed of hybrid

286
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:11,632
and values-based experiences
is going to emerge.

287
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,967
So you're gonna have companies

288
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,462
and sort of organizations
pursuing two strategies.

289
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:18,010
So there are gonna be lots

290
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,589
of hybrid physical digital experiences

291
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,925
like sort of touchless mobile check-in

292
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:23,936
and all that kind of stuff at hotels.

293
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,332
And we're also gonna design experiences

294
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,211
that focus on customer outcomes,

295
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,019
such as saving money or
protecting the environment

296
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,250
as discussed before when
we're talking about values.

297
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,770
And so we're gonna have to measure

298
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,151
these experiences differently.

299
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,170
And then finally, in the kind

300
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,689
of engagement in the experience realm

301
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,009
in the long term anticipatory experiences.

302
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,770
So the sort of much more
sophisticated version

303
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,810
of well usually you're looking
for this kind of product.

304
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,160
So I'm going to advance you
into a journey searching

305
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,520
for that kind of product
when you come to my app

306
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,307
or my other experience will sort of clash

307
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:00,774
with people's expectations about privacy

308
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:05,774
as in consumers have sort of
lots of contradictory impulses

309
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,155
when it comes to how much they
want you to know about them,

310
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,530
and how they're going to
react to you displaying

311
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,870
what you know about them.

312
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,458
So all of us in information
security and our friends

313
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,160
and privacy and experience
design are going to have

314
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,730
to figure out how to actually make

315
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,111
these anticipatory experiences
work in a non-creepy way,

316
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,350
if you will.

317
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,690
And so the sort of consumers don't say,

318
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,180
I am uncomfortable with
the way that this company

319
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,101
or this organization is using the things

320
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:37,360
that they knows about me.

321
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,950
Okay, so how do we secure these things

322
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,299
across those three timeframes?

323
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:45,717
So for the short term,
enjoying the temporary respite

324
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,135
for a little while longer,

325
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,500
so you'll have fewer customer complaints

326
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,850
about security controls because they know

327
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,490
that you need them when
you're doing all kinds

328
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,323
of digital things.

329
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:58,480
And indeed knowledgeable
consumers have read lots

330
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,930
of articles about the uptick

331
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,478
in different kinds of
fraud during the pandemic.

332
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,140
And so they're grateful

333
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,620
that you're actually
trying to protect them.

334
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,480
And the second place, you're
gonna have more direct

335
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,359
to consumer that makes aggregators
more attractive targets.

336
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:15,570
So for example, if your
company sells through Shopify

337
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,910
or similar, you should expect Shopify

338
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,550
and similar to be big targets

339
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,699
for different kinds of attackers,

340
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,011
and thus, you may find yourself

341
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:26,102
with a data breach or other problem

342
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:28,260
that comes through one
of those aggregators.

343
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,821
So you need to be prepared to respond

344
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:31,164
to something like that.

345
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:33,128
And for all of us here in Europe,

346
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,844
we're gonna need some more controls

347
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:37,857
to detect QR code fraud in payments

348
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:41,220
because we've had a sort of
really interesting renaissance

349
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,530
in QR codes for digitizing online payments

350
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,342
over the last little while, and
those are level to continue.

351
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,449
So those are gonna draw more scanners,

352
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,810
so we need security controls
to protect against them.

353
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,104
In the medium term,

354
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,570
we're going to need to
implement security controls

355
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,248
that cross digital physical boundaries.

356
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:01,763
And so I talked a lot about
hybrid experiences earlier.

357
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:04,926
And the security controls should transfer

358
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:08,268
across the different elements
of those experiences.

359
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,611
And so it's gonna be up
to us to design controls

360
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:15,120
where that is easy to do
and indeed consistent.

361
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,970
And secondly, we're gonna
need better controls

362
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,053
to make values-based choices
affordable to more consumers.

363
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:26,053
So we can, by implementing
sort of at scale things,

364
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,287
like provenance and kind of sustainability

365
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,850
and carbon credit verification,

366
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,676
make those sort of
attributes more affordable

367
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,420
to a mass market of consumers
that will want them.

368
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,860
And so this is one of those places

369
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,140
where things that we can
do in the world of security

370
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,285
actually make a real difference

371
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,689
to our businesses top and bottom line.

372
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,801
So that's something to really investigate

373
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:54,053
and learn how to do in a
non-question or based way

374
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,691
over the medium term.

375
00:15:55,691 --> 00:16:00,660
And the long term, we can use
software security controls

376
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,640
to match anticipatory experiences

377
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,380
to the comfort of customers.

378
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,720
So we can use security
controls to make sure

379
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,070
our developer friends build
systems that know customers,

380
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,490
but they don't cross over into the creepy.

381
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,363
So security controls can actually help

382
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:17,840
not just comply with
regulations do all the things

383
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,401
that developers usually don't care about,

384
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:23,294
but actually make the experiences
better and more accessible

385
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:26,630
to consumers, even when
they're sort of anticipatory

386
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,313
and thus have a lot of
potential to cause backlash.

387
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,570
So moving to the third shift,
companies and governments

388
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,750
are going to invest in
things that once seemed

389
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,080
the impossible to drive
the future of work forward.

390
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,870
So this one gets really speculative.

391
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,771
So bear with me here.

392
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:42,997
This is the fun part.

393
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:46,670
So in the short term,
companies that have shown a lot

394
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,500
of empathy through this pandemic period,

395
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,690
and as we come out of it.

396
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,560
In investing in their
employees are gonna gain

397
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,526
a creative edge.

398
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:57,986
So all of us, I'm lucky enough to work

399
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:00,960
for a company that I feel like handled,

400
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,160
this sort of unprecedented
challenges pretty well.

401
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,530
And some of you probably
are also their employers

402
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,264
that did that are going to
kind of reap some dividends

403
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,486
in the sense that all
of us employees who feel

404
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,209
is that their employer did that

405
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,194
are more likely to stick around
as the job market improves.

406
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,781
And all of our sort of research into this,

407
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:26,470
tells us that those employees
bring more creative ideas

408
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,303
to the table.

409
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:30,087
They invest more in the kind of future,

410
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,690
in the future progress of their employer.

411
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,855
So that creative edge
is really gonna matter

412
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,359
as talent that has lots

413
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,899
of movement possibility sticks around

414
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,011
over the short-term period,

415
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:43,570
and it'll pay dividends kind
of on through the whole decade.

416
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,830
So in the medium term, this
is where our policy friends

417
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,250
in the public sector come in.

418
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,688
So they're already working to
seize on the new possibilities

419
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,572
of this new world of work.

420
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,747
And so as employment levels recover

421
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:00,174
at varying rates of speed
depending on the place.

422
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:03,150
You're gonna have a lot
of remote working boosting

423
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,984
the excerpts of big economic hubs.

424
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,032
Like you've probably
all seen articles about

425
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:11,087
this sort of how sales in the suburbs

426
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,424
of major cities outpacing the growth

427
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,928
in house prices in the centers
of the cities themselves,

428
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,200
and so that sort of will
continue for awhile.

429
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,710
You're gonna have firms shedding

430
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,460
a bunch of their high cost
city center office space

431
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,250
and turning it into kind
of hot desk working.

432
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,651
And you'll also see supply
chain diversification

433
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,730
giving a boost to lower costs regions

434
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,560
of rich countries with
good transport links.

435
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,685
So places like Extremadura
in Spain and so on

436
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,629
because there'll be a bunch
of government incentives

437
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,290
to attract some reassured manufacturing.

438
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,290
And in the long term, work is
gonna get redistributed rather

439
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,615
which will slow hyper urbanization.

440
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:57,510
So this is the big speculative
one, which is we've got lots

441
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,310
of people who have transitioned to kind

442
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,321
of what we plan to be
two days in the office,

443
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:06,060
three days out of the
office kinds of remote work

444
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,388
and all kinds of permutations thereof.

445
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:12,290
So you're also gonna
have people particularly

446
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,440
with in-demand skills.

447
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,540
So I'm looking at you,
information security people

448
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,889
who are here and privacy people

449
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,384
and pretty much everyone
who attends RSA Conference.

450
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:23,100
We have the opportunity to
live in very different places

451
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,476
as do other folks with sort
of rare on the ground skills

452
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:30,405
and that distributes economic
activity more evenly.

453
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,940
And so provided, they're adequate kind

454
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,090
of broad band knowledge and
infrastructure investments,

455
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,800
you including in kind of regions

456
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,610
of developing countries with
the Philippines and Vietnam.

457
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,476
You will see a lot more even distribution

458
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,356
of the kind of people pulling
down the big salaries,

459
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,440
which will create more

460
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,406
evenly distributed
economic activity overall.

461
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:57,036
And you will get more
affordable kind of mega cities

462
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:01,250
as a lot of that office
space gets repurposed

463
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,185
as living space.

464
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:04,040
So this is all,

465
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,760
you know it sounds like a
lot of rampant speculation,

466
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,158
but there are a lot of reasons to believe

467
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,370
that if policymakers do things right,

468
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,723
and if things go sort of
as we're expecting them to

469
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:14,556
that these shifts

470
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:18,700
even these speculative long
term ones will actually happen.

471
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,950
So what does that mean
for all of us in security?

472
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,684
So for this shift, we are
going to in the short-term

473
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,076
see that we've got some
blocking and tackling to do.

474
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,589
So let's talk about that first.

475
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:32,669
So we need to ensure
that you return to work,

476
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,440
return to office plans

477
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,470
that our companies are putting into place

478
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,925
and our organizations
are putting into place

479
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:40,592
actually match employee
privacy expectations

480
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:43,360
and the actual applicable box.

481
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,074
So we need to balance the health
and safety of the workforce

482
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,325
with individual's rights

483
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,433
and freedoms, privacy, confidentiality,

484
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:52,492
this is not an easy thing,
and we need to comply

485
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:56,190
with the regulatory
requirements that are changing.

486
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,268
So we've gotta make sure
the things we're doing

487
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:01,116
are lawful and ethical
and that they also align

488
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,160
with the expectations of our employee base

489
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,760
so that we can keep those
employees we talked about before.

490
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
So that's a tough challenge.

491
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,696
And all of you who are
listening to me talk right now

492
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,202
are the best people to do it.

493
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,680
So that's something
really important to focus

494
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,692
on over the next 18 months,

495
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,864
and indeed in the very immediate term.

496
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:22,864
Second thing we need to do is
replace the sort of duct tape

497
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,420
and a string quick and dirty,
secure remote work stuff

498
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,590
we put in place because we
needed to do it really fast

499
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,466
with permanent solutions that
will allow us to fall back

500
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:35,554
to 100% remote work when we need to.

501
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,744
Because that may not be the
design point for our company,

502
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:43,744
but in the event of a natural
disaster and another pandemic

503
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,659
you name it, we're gonna need it.

504
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,160
So we want this functionality
available to us.

505
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,217
And indeed, if you attend a
lot of the rest of this track,

506
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,145
there are a lot of helpful sessions

507
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,623
on kind of a lot of detail
of exactly how to do this.

508
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:00,280
And thirdly, this is one that
seems obvious once you hear

509
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,240
about it, but you
wouldn't necessarily think

510
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,152
of it right out of the gate,

511
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:06,550
is you should plan for your
insider threat detection models

512
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,560
to break again 'cause they
broke with you all when remote,

513
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,325
and they're all gonna break
again when you go back

514
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:14,130
to your return to work hybrid scheme.

515
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,850
Because your old scheme

516
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,929
where like most people we're in office,

517
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,321
and you're nearly 100% remote scheme,

518
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:22,703
neither one of those apply anymore

519
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,230
as the workforce goes
back in a hybrid fashion.

520
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,250
So plan to kind of rebuild your model,

521
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,310
and if you forget to endure

522
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,270
a lot of detection firms very quickly.

523
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,629
So I definitely take the time to do this

524
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,754
as you go back into a hybrid model

525
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:41,490
so that you have a workable
insider threat detection model,

526
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,810
and you don't drive yourself nuts

527
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,023
with a lot of false alarms.

528
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:47,669
In the medium term, if
you haven't already,

529
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,654
and you have call centers,

530
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:51,950
tool up to secure
permanently virtual ones.

531
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,565
If you hadn't already run
kind of mostly virtual,

532
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:57,270
kind of call center
work before the pandemic

533
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,828
has shown it absolutely can be done.

534
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:01,801
And there are a lot of advantages
for retaining employees

535
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:05,550
and for kind of having less
turnover and all the rest of it.

536
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,293
So expect your company to wanna do that,

537
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:09,881
make sure you have the tools
to do it and to secure it.

538
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:14,740
And certainly design for
the continued conversions

539
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,420
of employees and consumer
privacy expectations

540
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,889
in the sense that all of us are consumers

541
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:21,149
when we go home at night

542
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,340
or well when we sort of
leave our home offices

543
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,840
at night at the moment.

544
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,113
And so we bring our consumer
privacy expectations

545
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,570
with us to the workplace.

546
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,540
And so your employees
are going to continue

547
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,393
to feel that way.

548
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:34,983
And so it's going to be up to all of us

549
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:37,989
to make sure that
whatever our companies do

550
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:41,253
is more conforming if
employee expectations

551
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,044
and is not Orwellian and
conforming to the horror stories

552
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,585
that many of us have heard so many of

553
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:50,150
over the course of this pandemic.

554
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,960
And then thirdly, in the long term,

555
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
we'll need to be ready to
deploy entire secure edge

556
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,482
in a container type modules

557
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,620
to small sites in developing countries.

558
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,350
This is sort of part of a
long-term speculation, right?

559
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,740
So as work redistributes
to different places outside

560
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,980
kind of the major city, first
of all country locations

561
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,230
that a lot of you are most familiar with.

562
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,261
We're gonna have small sites in countries

563
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:19,370
that don't always have
all of the infrastructure

564
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,500
that one might expect.

565
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,445
And so we're gonna need
kind of secure edges

566
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,379
for those people to work with

567
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,340
because we can't just expect them to,

568
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,370
you know use the cloud to
use the services deployed

569
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,350
out of the cloud in some far away place

570
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,309
because there's just
not enough connectivity.

571
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,940
And secondly, we're gonna
need to bolster employee trust

572
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,756
in management to drive faster innovation.

573
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:41,782
So the most valuable resource
most of our companies have

574
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,039
is all of us who go to sleep every night

575
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,709
after we finish up working.

576
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,171
And so if we trust our employers,

577
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:52,490
we feel they invest in us and
then we will invest in them.

578
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,863
And sort of we will kind
of put our best thinking

579
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:58,150
into what we do for our companies.

580
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,459
And we will have those ideas

581
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,472
that spawn whole new product lines

582
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:05,170
and develop whole new sort of
modes of engaging customers

583
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,620
and indeed open all new
markets for our companies.

584
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,552
So we wanna make sure that
we in security and privacy

585
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:16,150
and all the associated
different disciplines

586
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:19,020
actually contribute to that.

587
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,370
And because we're the ones
who implement the controls.

588
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,389
We have an opportunity to make sure

589
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,490
that actually happens.

590
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,400
So fourth shift smart firms are gonna

591
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,150
be retiring technical debt fast

592
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,240
and then riding the tech disruption wave.

593
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,899
In the short term, firms
are gonna keep accelerating

594
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:41,199
their digital initiatives and
reinforcing their foundations.

595
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,410
So we did a lot of overnight
migration to digital.

596
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,880
It caused a lot of disruption

597
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,277
and leased a lot of productivity.

598
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:51,190
And so firms that are lucky enough

599
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,067
to sort of either be able to say,

600
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,900
"Okay, we're gonna have
stinky returns for awhile,

601
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,970
so let's not waste a good crisis."

602
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,530
Or that have grown a tremendous amount

603
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,190
if it overall to the pandemics
the sector they're in,

604
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,980
or because they grabbed some opportunities

605
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,172
sooner than everybody else.

606
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:09,370
So those companies are gonna

607
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,093
either catch up with the digital leaders

608
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:14,180
in their field if they were
behind, or just leapfrog ahead

609
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,461
if they were already close to the front.

610
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:19,091
So there'll be re-platforming
sort of all kinds of,

611
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:22,889
sort of all kinds of things
to kind of either catch up

612
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,160
with the leaders or to go faster.

613
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,970
In the medium term,
overhauling business models

614
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,072
is gonna transform kind
of whole ecosystems

615
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:33,370
in whole industries.

616
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,247
So assuming that you kind of paid off

617
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:39,170
a bunch of technical debt
and leapfrogged the head

618
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,971
or caught up in that short term,

619
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:44,828
you are going to be able
to innovate and grow

620
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:46,402
as the economies recover,

621
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:49,380
and as things start to really grow again.

622
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,146
So you whereas the companies
that didn't do that did

623
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,930
either like pocketed the gains

624
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,383
or sort of turtled up during this

625
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,480
sort of difficult period are gonna

626
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,777
be playing technology catch
up again in five years.

627
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:02,890
So there's all kinds of sort of stuff,

628
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,060
like you'll see industry
specific collaboration

629
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,929
to develop transparent and
flexible supply chains.

630
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,070
'Cause that's obviously a
sort of big thing we need

631
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,128
to shore up because all of the disruptions

632
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:13,300
over the past year

633
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,639
and then things like ships
getting stuck in the Suez canal

634
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,010
for days have brought home
to us that sort of super lead

635
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,902
and just in time sometimes
causes big problems.

636
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,090
So there's a lot to do into kind

637
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,596
of build platforms,
marketplaces, and build Slack

638
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,420
into those systems.

639
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,470
And in the longer term,
there's gonna be a new sort

640
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,210
of technology disruption cycle

641
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,160
that will emerge after
all this modernization

642
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,754
so five years and beyond.

643
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:42,813
And in this disruption cycle,

644
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,590
you're gonna start to see kind

645
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,889
of the general purpose
technology investments

646
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,908
by the public sector in
the university sector,

647
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:53,020
and so on start to pay dividends.

648
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,770
So by this point, you not
want, not to be clinging

649
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,660
to the sort of winning
strategies of the 2010.

650
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,516
So front-end apps and public cloud

651
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,457
because the S-curves on
those will start to flatten.

652
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:08,181
And so things will get
advances in electrification

653
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:12,278
and further automation
and robotics and changes

654
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,870
in materials and all of
those kinds of things

655
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,308
that's where the post five-year
innovation is going to be.

656
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,045
So all of us need to be mindful
of that and sort of think

657
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:24,853
about how that's gonna change
things when we get there.

658
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,658
And so as to how to secure this,

659
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,863
retiring technical debt
which means there's

660
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:31,710
a bunch of security stuff to be done.

661
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,670
And in the first place,

662
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,846
we should replace a bunch
of old security stuff too.

663
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:40,650
So all of us have overlapping
bits of security tech

664
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,899
and process that we don't need.

665
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:45,396
And so now's the time to
get rid of a bunch of it.

666
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:48,659
Sort of in the very tactical
expect lots more Azure

667
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,551
because the pandemic has massively
accelerated its adoption.

668
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:54,755
You had lots of CEOs who went to Azure

669
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:56,680
because of the pandemic and then said,

670
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,416
yeah, okay, I'll take all
the security stuff too.

671
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,656
So where you've got a lot

672
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,092
of pretty good enough security
stuff in those bundles.

673
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,620
You're gonna wanna use them,

674
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,669
and it'll sort of cost you
less and so on and so forth.

675
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,192
So think about this as
you watch your company

676
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:13,500
or your organizations
as your adoption curve

677
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,084
and just make sure to
take advantage of it.

678
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:17,900
In general, also the
corollary is to invest

679
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,630
in cloud security, probably super obvious

680
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,576
but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.

681
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:26,677
And lastly, we've had some
interesting enthusiasm

682
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,659
from an unexpected quarter.

683
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,218
So lots of IT people in regulated industry

684
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:35,579
have gotten really enthusiastic about BYO

685
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,610
and getting rid of all corporate devices

686
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,370
as a result of the pandemic

687
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,429
'cause they saw what was possible.

688
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,574
And so it's going to be up to all of us

689
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,350
to burst their bubble somewhat

690
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,678
and just make sure we all
kind of comply with the rules.

691
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:50,434
Because there's a lot of stuff
we're still not allowed to do

692
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:51,790
in regulated industry.

693
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,643
So let's make sure that the
enthusiasm doesn't carry us way.

694
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,843
In the medium term, we have
a lot of investing to do

695
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:01,210
in operational technology security

696
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,253
for all of those connected
automated production lines

697
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,495
that we have been building

698
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:07,340
and we'll continue to be building.

699
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,612
And indeed, this is a place

700
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:14,240
where a lot of us don't
know what we don't know.

701
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,000
So make sure to spend time if you come

702
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,070
from the kind of information
technology side of security

703
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,909
like a lot of us do, me included.

704
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,540
So make sure to spend time with people

705
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,060
who actually know operational
technology environments

706
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,550
and who can help you think
about them the right way.

707
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,055
So this is where those exchange programs

708
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:32,320
between OT and IT really start to pay off

709
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,820
both in general and in security.

710
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,730
In the long term, I talked a little bit

711
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,190
about blockchain and third-party
risk management earlier.

712
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,145
Yes, I know applying the blockchain result

713
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,933
to everything is the new block.

714
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,615
But in the long term here,

715
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:48,142
blockchains are actually
gonna be mature enough

716
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:53,142
for doing real useful third-party
risk management at scale.

717
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,700
And that's a way of getting rid

718
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,490
of those horrible questionnaires forever,

719
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,107
which I think we're all a big fan of.

720
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,913
And secondly, we in the
sort of information security

721
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:06,060
and privacy and associated
disciplines need

722
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,331
to assume responsibility

723
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:10,019
for securing those disruptive use cases

724
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,120
with new technology that I
was talking about before.

725
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,929
So do not assume that the people

726
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,065
who are developing those new materials,

727
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:21,890
new battery technology, new automation,

728
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,360
et cetera, et cetera, have thought at all

729
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,654
about how to secure them
because it's not what they do.

730
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:30,400
And so this gives us a
tremendous opportunity

731
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,207
to be part of that big change
and to really help it happen.

732
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,846
So I suggest everybody
bone up on all those kind

733
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,810
of fundamental technology advances

734
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,754
as they start to come along

735
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:44,730
and think about what we can
do to secure those things

736
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,880
as they make their way
into the real world.

737
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,989
So in the fifth shift,
business resiliency is going

738
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,690
to become a competitive advantage.

739
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,430
So let's break that down across
the three timeframes again.

740
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,510
So in the short term firms are gonna focus

741
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,090
on essential risk management

742
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,030
and business continuity maturity.

743
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,149
So this is something that's
been seriously under invested in

744
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,790
over the last two decades, at least.

745
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,964
And so to give you one kind
of fun data point here,

746
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,649
pandemics should have been
considered to be inevitable.

747
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,790
I remember hearing President Obama talk

748
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,060
about the thing he was
really worried about

749
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,000
during this sort of tail
end of his presidency

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,670
was a global pandemic with
a respiratory illness,

751
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,053
which seems unusually
prescient looking back.

752
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,910
But when some colleagues
of mine took a look

753
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,049
at the Fortune 50's 10-K reports,

754
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,968
we saw that there were only
50% mentioned the pandemic

755
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:41,810
in the risk profiles for investors.

756
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,738
They classified it as like an act of God.

757
00:32:43,738 --> 00:32:46,424
Only Apple of all of those companies

758
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,657
had done anything to
ensure their downside.

759
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:51,120
So there's a lot of work to be done

760
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,570
in improving our risk management

761
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,960
and our business continuity,

762
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,097
and that needs to go
on as soon as possible.

763
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:59,330
In the medium term, supply
chains are gonna aim

764
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,020
for redundancy, flexibility,
and sustainability.

765
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,321
So I talked a little bit
about the sort of limitations

766
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:06,684
that became very obvious
during the pandemic.

767
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,922
And indeed when ships get
stuck in the Suez canal

768
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,069
in just-in-time delivery models.

769
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:15,090
And so there's going to
be a lot of investment

770
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,129
in diversification in
moving away from individual

771
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,830
and regional sole suppliers

772
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,203
which means we need more
visibility into supply chains

773
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,983
and the ability to anticipate

774
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:28,946
and respond to kind of nascent
problems before they happen.

775
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:31,499
And in the long term, this is a place

776
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,237
where artificial
intelligence will help us.

777
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:36,254
So artificial intelligence enabled

778
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:39,179
sort of enterprise risk
management is going to help us

779
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,720
handle uncertainty and systemic risk.

780
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,759
So uncertainty is going to
be a fact of life this decade

781
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,350
if there are any constant,

782
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,283
I think we should just
expect continuous change.

783
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:52,480
And so enterprise risk
management has historically

784
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,570
not been much of a kind of digital leader,

785
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,179
if anything, it's been a ladder.

786
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,640
And so over the long-term
here, you're gonna see it go

787
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,066
to really embracing advanced technology

788
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:06,130
so that risk management can be done

789
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,885
in a much more sophisticated way.

790
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,449
There are plenty of companies

791
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,060
with sophisticated risk management people.

792
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:14,440
Now they can take kind of
the next technological leap

793
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,580
and progress.

794
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,092
So let's talk about how
to secure this then.

795
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:20,060
So this one's a security bot.

796
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,487
It's easy to see how
business resiliency being

797
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,639
a competitive advantage is a good thing

798
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,779
in the security world,
but there's some things

799
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,469
we need to do to respond
to these investments,

800
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,464
and I'll talk about those.

801
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:33,420
So we haven't historically
done a whole lot

802
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,598
of aggregating security risk data with IT

803
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,072
and operational risk data.

804
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:39,096
That's something we need to start doing.

805
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:41,313
We need to expand the
definition of resiliency

806
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,181
to include people matters.

807
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,420
In the medium term, we need to look

808
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,018
for unintended consequences
of risk management decisions.

809
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,618
We need to automate
third-party risk management

810
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,806
as companies diversify in those sort

811
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,210
of supply chain aspects
that I talked about.

812
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,810
In the long term,

813
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,750
we need to make explicit
trade-offs of efficiency

814
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,613
versus flexibility or reliability.

815
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:03,558
Because reliability and flexibility

816
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:07,120
actually give you material returns

817
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,160
in situations where
disruptions happen often.

818
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,839
So they're worth kind of
quantifying explicitly

819
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,933
and indeed investing.

820
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,156
So how should we apply all of this?

821
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:21,240
I've given you lots of
recommendations for how

822
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,870
to secure this things
in the short, medium,

823
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,892
and the long-term.

824
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:28,460
So this is the tell him
what you already told him

825
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,150
section of my presentation.

826
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,724
So that you have a few
short-term things to walk away

827
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:35,630
and do right after the conference

828
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,160
or indeed right after this presentation

829
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,950
if you're feeling really
enthusiastic about them, have that.

830
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,884
So secure those no-touch experiences

831
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:44,050
if you've got drones flying
around with car keys,

832
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,601
and you haven't thought
about the security of that,

833
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,240
please do and intervene as necessary.

834
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,017
Here in Europe, the QR code security

835
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,410
is a really important thing to do quickly

836
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,029
because of all of the
digitization of online payments

837
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,705
that continues and scammers
have already gotten wise to it.

838
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,100
Ensure that those return to work plans

839
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,969
actually matched privacy expectations,

840
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:07,260
and the applicable regulations,

841
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,113
as you start to move back into offices

842
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:11,886
that should be happening
within a matter of months.

843
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:14,180
That's something to focus on right now

844
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,812
as those plans are getting
formulated and disseminated.

845
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:20,340
And upgrade those quick-and-dirty-secure
remote work tools.

846
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,640
Because you never know
when you're gonna have

847
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,299
to fail back over to
working remotely 100%,

848
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,660
and it's going to happen fast,
just like it did this time.

849
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,890
So this way you'll be ready.

850
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,210
And never waste a good crisis
is a really good spirit

851
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,600
to approach this way.

852
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,350
Get rid of your old security
tech while your company

853
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,394
is re-platforming your future you.

854
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:42,990
You know 18 months from now,

855
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,330
we'll thank past you for doing this.

856
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,310
And finally, invest in cloud security now,

857
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,500
if you haven't already

858
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,396
because you're gonna
have a heck of a lot more

859
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:56,000
moving into the cloud, a lot
more Azure, as I said earlier.

860
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,975
So investing in those security tools

861
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,587
and competencies is really
gonna pay dividends.

862
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:05,588
And that is all of these scheduled
programming, as they say.

863
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,490
So thank you so much for
hanging in there with me

864
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,747
during this and for asking me questions

865
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,401
as the presentation was rolling.

866
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,750
In the slides, you will
find links to the sort

867
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,352
of key pieces of research that's underpin

868
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:23,120
a lot of the thinking
in this presentation.

869
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,322
So please do check them
out after RSA Conference

870
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:28,015
and have a look at them

871
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:30,620
and let them guide you as you go forward.

872
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,113
Thanks so much and have a
great rest of the conference.
