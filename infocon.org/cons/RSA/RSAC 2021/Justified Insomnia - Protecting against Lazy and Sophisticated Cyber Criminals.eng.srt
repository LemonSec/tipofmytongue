1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,710
- If you've not been sleeping
due to cyber concerns,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,400
and are attending this talk,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,200
I will do my best to keep you awake.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,239
Welcome to RSA.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,840
I would like to thank you
for attending the session.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,470
I'm gonna be speaking about
the way cyber criminals

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,200
can attack through simple
uncomplicated means

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,160
ranging to complex intricate schemes

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,038
but I'm also gonna be talking

10
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:24,838
about how you can ultimately
protect yourself from both.

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,180
RSA 2020 was the last physical
event that I attended.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,030
Ironically, while in
San Francisco for this,

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,950
I received notification that I just hit

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,360
the 1 million mile mark with Air Canada.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,350
Like most of you, I've not flown since.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,750
And I do not see this
changing in the near term.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,620
Simply put COVID has led

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,320
to a massive shift to remote everything,

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,800
working, buying and selling, banking,

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,053
just to mention a few.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,120
This wide dispersion of cyber interactions

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,140
has resulted in an exponential
growth of attacks surfaces.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,490
Given the rapid transition,

24
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,319
as with other similar disruptive changes,

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,922
this has also led to less
strategized security responses.

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,090
Our journey will start with an overview

27
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,833
of threats as analyzed and
compiled by Blackberry.

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,400
Next, I will introduce
an emerging cyber threat

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,780
landscape that is coming
at us like a tsunami

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,290
something you may not
have given a thought to,

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,030
even though like Google
will affect all of us.

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,040
And it will affect all of
us in the very near future.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,970
This is an area where you, as
part of the cyber community,

34
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,010
have the power to
personally affect the shape

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,333
of this brave new world.

36
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,259
I'll review details of this later,

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,043
but if you're worried you
might never sleep again, don't.

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,370
As a reward for your patience,

39
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,160
I will be giving away cyber
security secrets and advice,

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,210
that will protect you and
your business or company,

41
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,500
from the vast majority of threats,

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,860
all of this in the next 28 minutes.

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,963
So let's get started.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,480
In a world with increasing connectivity,

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,910
and rapidly evolving mobility solutions,

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,600
anyone focused on building
or deploying secure

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,930
and trusted products or services,

48
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,033
could suffer from a
justified lack of sleep.

49
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,399
Despite the threats we face
from simple to sophisticated,

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
Blackberry has a long track record

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,649
of building and securing
our connected lives.

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,290
There are patterns that make
cyber threats more predictable

53
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,093
and a methodology that allows
us to predict ourselves.

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,443
In this diagram,

55
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,973
you will see a vault that
contains a few walls.

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,679
This is often the reality
on a cyber data landscape.

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,490
Many corporations put
in preventative measures

58
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,600
while missing the comprehensive
and holistic solutions

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,450
that would provide the missing walls.

60
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,380
Even with a fully built vault,

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,840
or protected system without
the proper simple precautions,

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
you're essentially leaving the combination

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,859
on a post-it note on
the door of the fault,

64
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,853
which is not good.

65
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,123
It only takes one breach to
get access to an entire system.

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,853
So who am I and why am I
speaking to you about this?

67
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,463
This is one topic that
keeps me awake at night.

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,700
My thread management
skills were honed as a kid

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,149
growing up with five brothers
and a pretty tough sister

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,640
on a family farm.

71
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,609
We had to be agile and find solutions

72
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,730
quickly on many fronts.

73
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,810
I drove machinery, was an electrician,

74
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,270
a plumber, and a veterinarian.

75
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,020
Of course, many of the
threats were physical

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,200
cane came from my older brothers.

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,160
Early in my career I wrote software

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,690
that controlled the banking machine

79
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,190
and I spent some early
days breaking into systems.

80
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,460
Security was always top of mind,

81
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,410
even if sometimes it was getting around it

82
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,560
just for the challenge.

83
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,740
Early in my career, I wrote a white paper

84
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,603
on 20 ways to become a super
user in less than a minute.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
I had the privilege of evolving my skills

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,480
through work with IBM,
Bell Northern Research,

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,030
Cisco, Juniper, Dyson
Engineering and now Blackberry.

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,680
I've witnessed technology
disruption across computers,

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,460
internet, mobile, cloud.

90
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,690
And I've always been interested

91
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,453
in how we secure this technology.

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,290
It's really one of the
most pressing issues

93
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,673
of our quickly evolving
Uber connected world.

94
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,289
Today, I'm Chief Technology
Officer at Blackberry.

95
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,610
As part of this role,
I run an innovation lab

96
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,390
with over 100 people, looking
for advancements in security

97
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,873
across enterprise, automotive,
and government spaces.

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,030
A key part of what
Blackberry has always done

99
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,960
is providing privacy by securing data.

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,530
Over the last last decade,

101
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,979
we have evolved into a
security software company.

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,080
Our most recent acquisition of silence

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,690
in the early 2019 gives
us a next generation

104
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,253
Antivirus ML technology.

105
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,963
ML is essential for fighting
cyber challenges of the future.

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
What does this mean really?

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
For antivirus we look
across billions of files

108
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,980
and classify what is safe and what is not.

109
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,380
And it allows us to detect malware

110
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,963
like WannaCry years before it even exists.

111
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,919
So, to start off with,
on the threat report

112
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,984
Blackberry publishes are
our threat researchers

113
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,950
publish a threat report every year.

114
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,670
And in February of this year,

115
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,580
we launched the 2021 threat reports

116
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,359
that basically looks at
fact-based projections

117
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,683
on the cyber threats of the previous year.

118
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
I'm gonna highlight some content today

119
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,530
but for deeper insights,

120
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,960
I really recommend you download
and read this full report.

121
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,830
The webpage is up on the screen.

122
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,370
You can Google Blackberry
2021 Threat Report.

123
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,160
And again, beyond what
I will talk about here

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,513
are there many, many more to
be found in the actual report.

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
So, a threat activity in 2020
COVID-19 as a vulnerability.

126
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,540
This is an unprecedented year

127
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,010
and COVID-19 introduced many challenges

128
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,120
making us feel helpless.

129
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,020
One thing I felt very personally

130
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
and my team were pleased to do,

131
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,020
we helped Canada work on
the COVID alert strategy.

132
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,400
We were involved in doing security audits

133
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,450
and architecture audits of
providing a more secure solution

134
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,243
for this critical service
when it was being deployed.

135
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:32,320
COVID-19 triggered mass move
from enterprise infrastructure

136
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,950
and security to home wifi,
virtual private networks,

137
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,640
bring your own device, configurations,

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,840
this could have been a
very precarious move.

139
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,600
Were VPN concentrators
going to support the fact

140
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,800
that everything was now upside down?

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,633
It's like planning

142
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,030
for what happens when
Niagara falls goes backwards.

143
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,380
It's just unprecedented.

144
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,719
And so many people work
together to try to figure out

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,133
how to make it work for us.

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,877
There's also much more
securely sensitive content

147
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,043
being stored in people's homes.

148
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,369
So, these aggressive dynamics accelerated

149
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,500
what was already in progress

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,133
in terms of mobile work trends,

151
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,020
but this acceleration it rapidly
extended the threat service

152
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,760
as organization around the world

153
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,022
were focused in immediate
pivot to this new work reality.

154
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,130
Remote workers were cited
as a cause of breaches

155
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,800
for 20% of organizations since
the start of the pandemic.

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,220
And there's an onslaught
of COVID-19 cyber attacks.

157
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,930
Attackers attempt to trick users

158
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,820
into installing a COVID-19
tracker application,

159
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,770
it's actually a ransomware, and
then they have to pay money.

160
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,010
There's misinformation sites,

161
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,719
there's a high number of rogue websites,

162
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,960
but as a security community,
we need to continue

163
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,469
to effectively address
the security implications

164
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,680
of introduced by this large
scale remote work reality.

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,910
We've been forced into this

166
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,630
and we need to continue to make it better.

167
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,880
We need to work together.

168
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:05,180
APT Mercenaries, we've
noted continued rise

169
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,190
in the outsourcing of everything,
including cyber espionage,

170
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,840
to mercenary APT groups.

171
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,289
You know, these are hackers for hire.

172
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,290
This can make threat actor
identification quite challenging

173
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,363
at a high level.

174
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:20,960
The tactics, techniques, and procedures

175
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,640
of these mercenaries often resemble

176
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,373
highly sophisticated
state sponsored campaigns.

177
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,010
However, the profiles and geographies

178
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,500
of their victims are far
too diverse to be aligned

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,453
with a single bad actors interest.

180
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,159
Threat actor identification
can be extremely challenging

181
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,283
for threat researchers with
this use of APT mercenaries.

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,093
Okay, the next area to
discuss is cryptojacking.

183
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,420
Bitcoin and therefore crypto mining

184
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,683
has been around since 2009.

185
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,070
Crypto miners receive Bitcoin
by verifying transactions

186
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,620
and solving numerical hashing problems.

187
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,190
The rate at which Bitcoin is mined

188
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,250
has halved every four years.

189
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,470
This having adversely affects
the difficulty of mining,

190
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,810
and therefore the computing power

191
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,660
required to effectively mine Bitcoin.

192
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,910
Cryptojacking the unauthorized use

193
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,240
of computer to mine cryptocurrency,

194
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,870
offers an illicit means to work

195
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,993
around the rising cost of crypto mining.

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,290
The infamous Slick Willie
was asked why he robbed banks

197
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,370
and he answered, "Because
that's where the money is."

198
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,780
So, cryptojackers, often
target high powered servers

199
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,079
in an enterprise environment

200
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
in order to maximize
their mining activities.

201
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,130
Why do they do that?

202
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,210
Because that's where
the CPU horsepower is.

203
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,930
So these server clusters
are targeted attack vectors

204
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,093
of this crypto mining.

205
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,680
As Bitcoin goes up so does
the reward for mining it.

206
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,180
So, as we're talking about vaults

207
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,859
the gold in the vault is
getting shinier over time

208
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,563
as the value of Bitcoin goes up.

209
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,533
Deepfake threat activity.

210
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,900
I'm sure everyone has seen
an interesting online video

211
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,850
of people posing as
celebrities with a convincing

212
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,740
overlay of the celebrities
appearance or voice,

213
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,870
while entertaining and scary,
this poses serious risks.

214
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,930
And we are now seeing its weaponization

215
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,270
which was accelerated as a world quickly

216
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,872
pivoted to working remotely.

217
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,670
Deepfakes posing as
important political figures

218
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,729
or celebrities have been used
to spread misinformation.

219
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,280
Symantec reports three cases of seemingly

220
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,959
deepfaked audio of
different chief executives.

221
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,820
The story goes, something like this,

222
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,340
a senior official was tricked
into transferring money

223
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,920
after he received an urgent
call from a fraudster

224
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,400
who impersonated the CEO voice
using defect technologies.

225
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,170
And now we're seeing several deepfake

226
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,473
as a service offerings.

227
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,580
As normalcy returns around the world

228
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,440
threat actors may look towards
increasing the weaponization

229
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,233
of deepfake technologies in the workplace.

230
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,099
Securing the electoral process.

231
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,160
This has been quite a year
in retrospect for elections.

232
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,847
Headline from the Guardian
stated, "US security advisor

233
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,137
"claims China has taken most active role

234
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:16,489
"in election meddling."

235
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,670
If you wanna hack an election,

236
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,660
the most obvious and least imaginative way

237
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,280
is to attack the ballot box.

238
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,370
But there's lots of other methods.

239
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,920
Policymakers and their
teams are vulnerable targets

240
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,569
for having their social media accounts

241
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,210
mined for exploitable information.

242
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,470
Election misinformation through
social media or news sites,

243
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,370
can be used to see doubt in
the integrity of the election.

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,990
2021 highlighted the fact
that minimizing interference

245
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,400
is a critical aspect of
maintaining free and fair elections

246
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,949
but it's also becoming
increasingly more difficult.

247
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,890
BAHAMUT is an active threat
group investigated extensively

248
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,939
by Blackberry threat researchers in 2020.

249
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,060
This is a well-funded technically adept

250
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,673
highly secretive and
effective threat group.

251
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,410
BAHAMUT may obscure its activity,

252
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,439
by imitating the same tactics, techniques,

253
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,593
and procedures popularized
by other threat groups.

254
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,610
I don't know if you've read it

255
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,010
but this sounds like a
subplot of cryptonomicon.

256
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,610
Backdoors and exploit shell
code written by BAHAMUT

257
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,420
often includes anti-analysis features.

258
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,300
When it's activities are detected

259
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,880
the threat group quickly changes tactics

260
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,513
and corrects any missteps
leading to its exposure.

261
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,689
Attackers keep evolving their
products to evade detection

262
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,490
so they can keep doing what they do.

263
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,233
Mobile overlay attack.

264
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,040
Social engineering continues
to be a highly effective means

265
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,620
for stealing payment and
accessing information

266
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,340
presented within the context
of an installed application

267
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,620
a prompt for a credit card

268
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,220
or password using well-designed form,

269
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,470
often yield success for attackers.

270
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,070
This trick works especially well,

271
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,973
when time coincide with
an application launch.

272
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,892
We're all busy,

273
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,070
were doing many things
were clicking through.

274
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,850
We don't notice that something

275
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,823
extra is going on in our device.

276
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Quite often if a malicious application

277
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,150
requires additional permissions,

278
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,340
it will grant itself permissions.

279
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,990
It can submit a request to the OS

280
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,840
and then automatically click okay

281
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,253
without any user involvement.

282
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,020
This attack is quite
often used around banking

283
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,283
and information stealing malware.

284
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,540
So this is scary, right?

285
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,810
This mobile overlay attack,
does it feel like a tsunami?

286
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,380
Well, it's not the tsunami
I'm gonna talk about.

287
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,780
Let's just call this one a big wave.

288
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,863
My tsunami is coming very shortly.

289
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Attack on critical verticals,
when you want to be disruptive

290
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,109
critical verticals are a popular target.

291
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,290
It's no surprise that in
times of global pandemic

292
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,120
stuff that people care
about like healthcare

293
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,110
and medical research

294
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,953
are primary interest to cyber criminals.

295
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,890
During 2020 Blackberry
observed increased incidents

296
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,780
of ransomware, attacks against hospitals

297
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,103
and healthcare providers.

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
Numerous phishing campaigns

299
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,470
aimed at stealing login credentials,

300
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,763
targeted critical sectors.

301
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,640
These attacks on critical
verticals are a great examples

302
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,480
of an opportunistic events that occur

303
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,263
as a result of major disruption.

304
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,930
So this concludes the
high level teaser content

305
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
from the threat report.

306
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,240
Please do download it and read it though.

307
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,190
There's some really
great content in there.

308
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,433
So this concludes my threat report teaser.

309
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,597
On my next screen I'm gonna show you

310
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:48,960
there's gonna be a video
of a woman on a computer.

311
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,193
I am sure nothing bad will
happen to this situation.

312
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,333
Oh my, would you pay?

313
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,770
Many people do, some
people say everybody pays.

314
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,040
But we are familiar with the
impact of being compromised

315
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,033
on equipment that we use
every day such as a laptop.

316
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,980
The effect can vary wildly

317
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,320
from the minor inconvenience
of having to pay ransomware

318
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,850
to a major inconvenience
such as identity theft.

319
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,673
This is life-changing catastrophic events.

320
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,359
I talk to people at security conferences

321
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,520
or I talked to people at
security conferences in the past

322
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,370
and you could just see in
their face the impact of...

323
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,680
I've had one gentleman in London, England,

324
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,390
talking about a room full of computers

325
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,660
that had to be re-imaged
and their entire inventory

326
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,219
across a global supply
chain had been wiped out

327
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,610
and they had to run
manually for two weeks.

328
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,580
I could just feel the emotion in his voice

329
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,930
as he told these stories.

330
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,069
And there's so many of them.

331
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,203
So, just as I pause here,
how well are you protected?

332
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,319
Do you have 2FA and secure passwords,

333
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,880
unique secure passwords on everything?

334
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,833
Do you have a zero trust architecture?

335
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,293
Do you follow the principles
of these privileges?

336
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,680
I wonder, were you impacted

337
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,563
by the solar wind security incident?

338
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,663
How are you protected
now and into the future?

339
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,270
Just imagine, this cyber attack,

340
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,203
imagine the impact of a
similar type of cyber attack,

341
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,329
a security attack but
in a two ton computer

342
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,200
moving at 56 kilometers per hour.

343
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,870
Now the impact has gone from inconvenient

344
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,770
to impacting the safety of
yourself and others around you.

345
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,700
Cyber-physical security is a new risk

346
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,573
in this emerging kinetic IOT space.

347
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,010
This was the tsunami I was
talking about at the beginning.

348
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,470
And by the way, it's also
covered in the threat report

349
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,380
as a special topic.

350
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,400
Connected vehicles which can
contain over 100 independent

351
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,560
developed software components
are difficult to secure

352
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,310
due to the multiple vendors
involved in their assembly.

353
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,910
This year, a number of
international entities

354
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,079
participating in the
automotive supply chain

355
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,620
make enforcing common cyber

356
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,912
security criteria extremely challenging.

357
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,669
Vehicles are increasingly
connected to the internet,

358
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,030
and this will be ramping
aggressively in the near future

359
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,830
especially with the emergence of 5G.

360
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,570
So, connected cars, let's
just lay a baseline.

361
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,312
Things used to be simpler.

362
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,890
With vehicles were in the
midst of a rapid transformation

363
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,240
led by the commodification of hardware

364
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,980
and the rise of complexity
and sheer amount of software

365
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,300
on each vehicle.

366
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,133
The trends are clear.

367
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,140
Cars are increasing their CPU capabilities

368
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,880
and converging on larger,
more capable compute clusters.

369
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,590
The number of connected cars
is increasing dramatically.

370
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,110
The bandwidth to the car
is increasing dramatically

371
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,379
electrification and autonomous development

372
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,880
are all driving increased
software in the vehicle.

373
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,389
This is a major, major
evolution that we're witnessing.

374
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,120
You are literally driving
around in a server right now

375
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,320
when you're in your car.

376
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,160
There's an adage as we,

377
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,810
and we learn this time and time again,

378
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,110
as we add CPU and bandwidth,

379
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,822
features will certainly follow.

380
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,410
But look at this, there's
growing complexity

381
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,280
already today in the car.

382
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,440
This diagram shows an increasingly

383
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,283
more feature rich automobile.

384
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,660
Increased connectivity, local
and cloud compute capabilities

385
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,570
and the introduction of many
new vehicle capabilities.

386
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,780
It leads to a much broader feature list

387
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,893
and emergence of software
as a key differentiator.

388
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm not gonna go through
it all, but night vision,

389
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,460
lane correction, heads up display,

390
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,290
you get the trend, adaptive
this, automatic that,

391
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,920
we experience a rapid development

392
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,080
of driver assist functionality

393
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,060
leading to more and more autonomous,

394
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,330
or leading towards more
autonomous features.

395
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,060
Perhaps you have some autonomous features

396
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,520
on your current vehicle like lane assist,

397
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,050
automatic braking, or automatic parking,

398
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,270
it's predicted by 2030 electronics,

399
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,663
plus software will be about
50%, the cost of the car.

400
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,580
But where from a cybersecurity perspective

401
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,653
does this leave us?

402
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,993
This diagram shows a
broader vehicle cockpit,

403
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,929
a vehicle cockpit in
cloud with some threats

404
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,543
for illustrative purposes.

405
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,409
A closer view on the details,

406
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,970
stealing passwords,
open-source vulnerabilities,

407
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,760
man in the middle attacks,

408
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,230
shows us that many of the threats

409
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,680
that we already have been dealing with

410
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,363
are also applicable in the car.

411
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,080
Key threat vectors,
internet based attacks,

412
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,080
4G, 5G, sensor attacks, GPS
radar, hardware attacks,

413
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,180
OBD two ports, USB near-field, wireless,

414
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,783
Bluetooth, key fobs, the list goes on.

415
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,440
Additional threat surface
with this new functionality

416
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,433
means increased need for
resilience in cyber security.

417
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,208
Service-oriented business
models are also taking shape,

418
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,930
which means not only safety concerns,

419
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,840
but privacy and financial implications.

420
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,300
Since we're looking at the introduction

421
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,493
of integrated payment systems.

422
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,880
Complexity of the cloud
adds additional challenges

423
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,983
and many current vehicle
attacks are cloud focused today.

424
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,000
There is hope and work, of course,

425
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,070
there's new cybersecurity regulation

426
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,460
adopted by UNECE WP.29.

427
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,520
It's being introduced
that requires automakers

428
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,030
to adhere to cybersecurity requirements,

429
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,730
and automakers have the flexibility

430
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,280
in tailoring the requirements
into their processes.

431
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,880
The cybersecurity UN
regulation is supported

432
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,950
by international standard ISO/SAE21434.

433
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,100
So, you'll hear that if you're not already

434
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,713
familiar with this WP.29 21434.

435
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
But this is an area where
cyber security experts

436
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,290
can help take their knowledge
that they possess today

437
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,889
and the solutions that they use today

438
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,610
take this knowledge to this
new platform to make it safer,

439
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,330
faster, until effective
cyber security protocols

440
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,110
and procedures are incorporated

441
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,500
into the design and manufacture vehicles.

442
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,120
Modern automobiles could
effectively be considered

443
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,303
in secure networks.

444
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,990
Okay, so that concludes my deeper dive

445
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,150
on connected automobiles

446
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,830
and my tsunami that I had
teased about at the beginning.

447
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,669
But we're now on to the hopeful
chapter of my presentation,

448
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,390
Cybersecurity Best Practices Top 10 List.

449
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,380
Some of you know...

450
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,450
I imagine this community
knows who David Letterman is.

451
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,150
So it's inspired by him.

452
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,430
Whether we're building new products

453
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,050
from embedded systems to
vehicles, to enterprise software,

454
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,240
we're looking to improve
security in our systems

455
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,030
that we already have been deployed.

456
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,560
We see common tactics that
are used by our adversaries

457
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,020
to exploit vulnerabilities

458
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
but there's also common principles

459
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,350
that we can employ to
protect from such attacks

460
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,149
whether it's simple or sophisticated

461
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,020
we can get much closer
to a much safer system.

462
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,940
Some of these will apply to
you directly and others may not

463
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,240
but it's important that you
study your cyber readiness

464
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,563
from a broad perspective.

465
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,100
Okay, number 10, cybersecurity
best practices top 10 list.

466
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,639
Number 10, trusted foundation.

467
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,390
Building analogy, the value
on the top will not be stable

468
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,863
without a trusted foundation.

469
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,270
Look at your people, your
process, your technology,

470
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,300
your hardware, your
software, your dev practice,

471
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,629
ensure you have a root of trust.

472
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,480
You need a deterministic architecture

473
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,363
that behaves well under stress,
under load, or under attack.

474
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,270
I like to say security
cannot be retrofitted

475
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,150
ask yourself and other experts.

476
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,583
Can I really trust this foundation?

477
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,073
Number nine, use secure components.

478
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:51,393
Analogy, one week wall
in a vault makes it very,

479
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,390
it makes it less a vault like I would say.

480
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,390
So, it's one wall, what
makes a vault useless.

481
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,740
Proper authentication of software

482
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,810
and hardware components is important.

483
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,950
On a car, you could isolate your safety

484
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,543
and non-safety components
perhaps through a hypervisor.

485
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,160
Laptops and smartphones use
a trusted computing base

486
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,583
for critical items.

487
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,493
You may have heard of the
trusted execution environment.

488
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,050
Use proven components with
defense in depth deployment.

489
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,470
So if we look at system on ships,

490
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,650
they must be secure in architecture

491
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,800
and access ports protected.

492
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,988
Did you shut down debug
ports or default accounts?

493
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:39,840
Is your memory secure?

494
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,760
These SOC should store a secret key

495
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,095
and act as the root of trust

496
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:47,163
for secure boot verifying
software before it's loaded.

497
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,440
The operating system must have
multi-level security features

498
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,040
such as access control policies,
encrypted file systems,

499
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,170
ruthless execution, path,
space control, thread level,

500
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,460
anomaly detection, and
applications in a vehicle.

501
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,240
All applications that are
downloaded should be certified

502
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,600
and signed with proper
authorities before they're run.

503
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,179
Assign manifest file
will set the permissions

504
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,600
of these resources.

505
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,070
These application must
always run in a sandbox.

506
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,683
These are the kinds of things
we should be looking at.

507
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,060
Number eight, protect the supply chain.

508
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,610
And you notice that we
added one wall to the vault.

509
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,040
Code scanning or composition analysis

510
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,440
use sophisticated binary code scanning

511
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,580
during software development or delivery

512
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,260
to provide an assessment, which
includes file composition,

513
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,363
what kind of CVEs are
contained in the file if any,

514
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,080
what kind of vulnerabilities
and indicators and metrics

515
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,612
to enable a secure
agile software solution?

516
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,409
This data can be used
to improve the software

517
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,540
to reduce its security risk
prior to production builds.

518
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,520
The other thing you need to look at

519
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,430
is continuous physical
security vendor sites.

520
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,910
Ensure that all vendors and
vendor sites are certified

521
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,330
via vulnerability assessment

522
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,210
and are required to maintain a certificate

523
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,570
of approved for delivery.

524
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,370
And this evaluation needs to be performed

525
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,852
on a continuous basis.

526
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,820
The solar winds incident
reported in December of 2020

527
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,830
reminded the world, that
effective threat detection

528
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,810
is a critical component
of a secure environment.

529
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,720
It also showed a scary attack factor

530
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,370
one that infects the dev pipeline.

531
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,270
I wonder if you were impacted by that.

532
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,130
Number seven secure communications
channels in your product.

533
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,993
Do not leave any clear text
or easily readable data,

534
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,832
do not move data on or off
your device unprotected.

535
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,020
Government secure phones
had something called DDAR

536
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,160
dual data at rest with different certs

537
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,100
applied to each layer of the encryption.

538
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,899
Very, very hard to decode that.

539
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,370
All device communication was
also encrypted data in flight.

540
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,090
This was looked at through a few lenses.

541
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,639
So how strong is your
encryption, but also who is it

542
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,820
that's doing this operation on your system

543
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,240
and what are they allowed to do?

544
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,300
So, encryption, authentication,
and authorization,

545
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,149
all need to be looked at.

546
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,220
And this applies within the end point,

547
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,350
end point to cloud, cloud to cloud.

548
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,570
So, specifically on a vehicle,

549
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,330
this means ensuring all
communication between the automobile

550
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,263
and the external world
is authentic and trusted.

551
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,000
Number six, develop
using secure methodology.

552
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,470
A developer can be paid
a lot to inject malware.

553
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,080
How do you catch this?

554
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,330
Could you catch it today?

555
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,100
You should agree on project
specific security requirements

556
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,909
including the extent of
assessment activities

557
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,010
at the beginning of a project,

558
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,890
tracking and reporting
metrics related to training

559
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,410
product and security teams

560
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,600
should be able to view the
metrics and trends at any times,

561
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,370
maintaining and using common
security guidance catalog

562
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,800
that contains specific
requirements, recommendations,

563
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,010
and procedures for avoiding
security vulnerabilities

564
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,503
and complying with different
customer requirements.

565
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,190
This is really important for traceability

566
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,583
for standards or safety.

567
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,930
Number five, monitor for anomalies.

568
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,340
Ensure that all software
has integrated analytics

569
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,800
and diagnostics that can
capture events and logs

570
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,100
and report the same to a cloud.

571
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,730
Basically is the device running normally

572
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,950
or is there something abnormal
happening in the device?

573
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,230
This will vary by device, but it could be

574
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,930
is there a root user on the device?

575
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,160
How many files are open?

576
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,080
How busy is the CPU, how
much memory is being used?

577
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,800
Is the communication going
off the correct ports?

578
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,138
You need to really monitor to make sure

579
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,740
that the device has not been compromised

580
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,003
and is acting strange due to
some kind of crypto event.

581
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,550
This is incidentally a very
important area of focus

582
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,330
for the use of machine
learning in security solutions

583
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,439
with the volume of data in today's systems

584
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,720
and the speed at which breaches occur,

585
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,080
this is an essential tool

586
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,520
for helping you protect your company.

587
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,720
I like to think of this
monitor for anomalies

588
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,150
as putting a camera inside the vault

589
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,800
to monitor what's going on.

590
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,893
Just in case someone happens
to breach the exterior.

591
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,139
Plan for getting compromised

592
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,500
basically a perfectly secure
system is not possible.

593
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,040
You need to know what you're going to do

594
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,899
in the event that you are compromised

595
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,990
layout details for steps you would take.

596
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,150
If in fact, your system is compromised,

597
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,930
reduce the blast radius, have
a response communication plan,

598
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,890
have remediation recovery plan.

599
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,820
So many times when a
critical event happens,

600
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,909
people are not prepared,
prepare for it and act on it.

601
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,530
This is important
business continuity step.

602
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,990
Do you have critical communications
infrastructure today,

603
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,030
that will continue to work

604
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,879
when your systems have been breached?

605
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Number three, deliver updates
and address vulnerabilities.

606
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,433
We're getting closer.

607
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:08,010
Let's add one more wall to the vault.

608
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,440
A device that is not updated
as a ticking time bomb.

609
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,800
For being compromised as hackers

610
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,374
essentially have all the time in the world

611
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:17,870
and all the known CVEs at their disposal.

612
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,669
Future-proof your system

613
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,490
but make sure you have a secure
OTA while you're doing it.

614
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,710
Remember detecting the
threat is only one step.

615
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,860
Actually closing the gap
with a software update

616
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,283
is an important one.

617
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,990
It's quite common for old threats

618
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,330
to go unaddressed for
surprisingly long periods.

619
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,439
We are still seeing reports

620
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
of the continued threat
of WannaCry ransomware

621
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,760
even though the attack
occurred four years ago,

622
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,493
millions of people are
still running windows XP.

623
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,929
I doubt they come to RSA.

624
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,980
That's my assertion but I could be wrong.

625
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,010
Number two, drive holistic protection.

626
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,950
We talk about prepare,
prevent, detect, and respond.

627
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,220
Think about all four of those phases

628
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,910
in your cyber security posture.

629
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,030
I know it's a top 10 list
and I snuck four onto one,

630
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,050
but it bears repeating.

631
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,560
Think about these four,

632
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,947
prepare, prevent, detect, and respond.

633
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:15,699
It only takes one entry
point to lose control.

634
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,700
And number one, cybersecurity
best practices top 10 list.

635
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,030
Number one is prioritize
a security culture.

636
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,000
Security as a community approach,

637
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,840
learn from and leverage
the best that is available.

638
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,429
Defense in depth.

639
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,763
There is a lot of historical
knowledge that can be applied.

640
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,600
If you do not architect a
plan to protect yourself,

641
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,899
you are left with hoping
you are not impacted.

642
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,043
And my friends hope is
not a good strategy.

643
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,140
Watch how others are attacked.

644
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,900
Try to hack yourself, have a bug bounty,

645
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,273
pay people to hack you.

646
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,600
And then we see the wall
of the safe going on,

647
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,449
security is not about
one person or one team.

648
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,320
Everyone can help.

649
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,669
Security education can help
your coworkers, your employees,

650
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,163
your family members,
friends, all be safer.

651
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,220
So, here's the top 10 list at a glance,

652
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,480
adopting these principles in our view

653
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,920
is very similar to making sure

654
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,090
that all sides of your safe are intact

655
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,750
and that you haven't
forgotten to lock the safe

656
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,100
with a good strong password

657
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:28,025
and make a two factor for good measure.

658
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,340
Adopt these principles will also allow you

659
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,000
to rest assured that no matter
what threat materializes

660
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,480
you will be more prepared.

661
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,030
It may not apply to all your needs,

662
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,053
but there's general wisdom in this list.

663
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,880
So, looking at this list

664
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,863
how did you do for alignment
with these best practices?

665
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,683
So, we talked about the threat report.

666
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,189
We drilled in on connected
vehicles, current and future.

667
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,833
And remember you can help us
make that environment safer.

668
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,787
And then we walked through a top 10 list

669
00:33:03,787 --> 00:33:06,910
to help make us more prepared.

670
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,900
Your data is your data and your
information can be protected

671
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,900
from both lazy and the
sophisticated cyber criminals.

672
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,280
With security technology
and best practices,

673
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,100
please be vigilant.

674
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,000
Well and stay from viruses of all kinds.

675
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,363
Thank you very much for
attending this session.

676
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,490
And if you're still with
me now and not sleeping

677
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,067
like our CSO in this picture,
I can still take questions.
