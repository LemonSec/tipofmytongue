1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,290
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,590
Welcome to RSA Conference 2021.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,189
My name is Erin Sindelar

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,240
and I am a researcher at Trend Micro.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,650
While I'm presenting today,

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,910
please feel free to ask
questions at any points

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,050
because I will be watching myself with you

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,930
which is gonna be really weird

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,140
but I'm really excited
today to talk to you

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,680
about an easier approach
to cloud security.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,310
Right, so easier, not easy.

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,759
Don't get your hopes up too much there

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,300
because it will take some effort still

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,833
but it does help avoid some
of the common pitfalls we see.

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,730
The cloud is a fascinating place

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,750
to build solutions for customers.

17
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,160
It provides easy access
to levels of technology

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,422
that simply weren't
available 10 years ago.

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,710
It allows you to watch the equivalent

20
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,490
of an entire data center

21
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,870
with a single command

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,449
which is kinda mind blowing

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,600
when you think how far
technology has come.

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,330
But there are challenges
that come with this power

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,110
and they kinda fall into two categories.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,620
And we'll talk a little bit about both.

27
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,426
One is with the technology
itself and securing it.

28
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,830
And the other is with people.

29
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,773
And I don't want to imply
that people are problem.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,830
I just want to acknowledge that sometimes

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,179
teams have a hard time
working together well.

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,240
And not as a historic
problem that I'm sure

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,100
you've all experienced yourselves.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,899
And it might be the more uncomfortable one

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,383
to talk about or (chuckles)

36
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:29,429
give you a little bit more discomfort

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,460
while you're listening.

38
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,309
So we're actually gonna start there

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,760
because we're friends now.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,910
So we might as well
start with harder part.

41
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,070
There have been differing opinions

42
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,570
between the seemingly
contrasting goals of developers

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,770
and security teams forever.

44
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,770
And that has only gotten
harder with cloud acceleration.

45
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,390
We recently wrote an article
called the four-box problem.

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,490
And it started with these two boxes of

47
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,243
developers and security.

48
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,940
The goals seem to be in contrast,

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,310
but we'll talk more later

50
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,760
about the fact that they're really not

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,283
but it does cause a lot of a problem now.

52
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,010
Over time with the growth of DevOps,

53
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,929
the development and operations processes

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,550
have been separated differently.

55
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,140
And technically, security
is an operational effort

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,220
for cloud environments.

57
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,140
However, that doesn't mean
that ops teams took on

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,063
all of the security efforts
for anything in your cloud.

59
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,280
In fact, most of the time,
security is just as separated

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,873
as it does before when
we just had two boxes.

61
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,760
Most recently we see more
and more large enterprises

62
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,380
introducing CloudOps teams.

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,460
These are really interesting.

64
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,800
They bring all of the cloud
people into a single team

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,460
and that includes security.

66
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,630
It's the closest that security
comes to cloud development

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,829
and actually being embedded

68
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,573
in the cloud development process.

69
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,890
It kind of from a security perspective

70
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,313
creates a mini sock for the
cloud, which is pretty cool.

71
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,830
But regardless of where you
fall in this four-box problem,

72
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,910
over time in the evolution of this issue,

73
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,620
security has kinda just pushed around,

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,670
or more accurately,

75
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,673
the person responsible
on the development side

76
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:22,553
for working with the security
team is moved around.

77
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,250
And the core differences in those goals

78
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,790
persists regardless of how it works.

79
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,230
So we'll talk more about
how the goals really

80
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,899
aren't that different in a little bit.

81
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,540
But first let's talk about the technology.

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,459
With the growth of the cloud,

83
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,950
it would make sense to
assume that we would see

84
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,743
more of the same problems that we see

85
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:44,700
with on-premise environments.

86
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,530
We should be seeing more
zero days exploit chains

87
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,893
ransomware, day-to-day security stuff.

88
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,700
But it turns out that's
not the same problems.

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,350
In fact, it's not
anywhere close to the top

90
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,850
of the concern list because

91
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,579
misconfigurations are actually
the biggest security concern

92
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,413
in the cloud.

93
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,780
Research from Trend Micro
and many other organizations

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,400
has shown that between 65 and 70%

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
of all security issues in the cloud

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,446
start with a misconfiguration.

97
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:21,233
And there are other threats
to cloud environments.

98
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,229
Absolutely.

99
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,750
In the past year, we've
seen a definite uptake

100
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,150
in Linux-based malware and crypto miners

101
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,200
that are targeting cloud
platforms in the wild.

102
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,960
But they have a long way
to go before they overtake

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,263
misconfigurations at the top spot.

104
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,180
I say they have a long way to go,

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,530
because if you look at all
public records of cloud attacks

106
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,489
and filter out things
that weren't actually

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,660
due to a cloud issue,

108
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,183
over 2 billion sensitive
records have been leaked.

109
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,260
And in all but one case,

110
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,150
that was due to a single misconfiguration.

111
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,210
One wrong setting,

112
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,710
one error or mistake,

113
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,340
led to all of that data being exposed

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,640
and all of those breaches.

115
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,340
The one exception being
more complicated event

116
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,099
was the Capital One breach in 2019.

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,540
You likely remember the incident

118
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,510
because it made a lot of news at the time.

119
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,140
And this more complex event was due to

120
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,253
two misconfigurations and a bug.

121
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,690
After the facts and
in-depth analysis was done

122
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,370
that actually found the
bug was inconsequential

123
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,750
to the end results.

124
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,723
And that impact was a hundred
million user records leaked.

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,110
And it essentially came down
to two misconfigurations.

126
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,990
And the team at Capital
One, our amazing cloud pros,

127
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,930
they're an AWS reference customer.

128
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,710
They've been a huge advocate
in the community for cloud.

129
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,130
They know what they're doing,

130
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,350
but everyone makes mistakes.

131
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,110
And the rate of change

132
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,163
of the cloud makes it
kinda understandable.

133
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,383
At the end of the day,

134
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:01,680
misconfigurations really
are just mistakes.

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,930
Sometimes those mistakes are
due to a lack of awareness.

136
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,330
Other times it's a missed opportunity

137
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,159
or something that was just an oversight.

138
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,930
But regardless, the mistakes still happen.

139
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,110
Now, this might seem a little far-fetched.

140
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,350
It might seem hard to
believe that this much damage

141
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,863
and this many breaches could
be caused by simple mistakes.

142
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,340
You might wonder how that's possible.

143
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,299
And I will answer that question.

144
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,530
But first there's a common misconception

145
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,030
about cloud security that I
feel like we need to address

146
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,253
before we move further.

147
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
It's often assumed

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,190
that the cloud service
providers themselves,

149
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,613
are a major security risk.

150
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,910
That might even be why
you would have held back

151
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,460
or gone a little slower
in digital transformation

152
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,893
in your organization.

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,300
However, this concern
hasn't been found true.

154
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,320
In fact, there have only been two breaches

155
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,130
across all four of the biggest
cloud service providers

156
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,522
in the past five years.

157
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,060
Now they have had to deal
with vulnerabilities.

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,670
There's always vulnerabilities in code.

159
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,100
But those are mostly due to the fact

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,150
that a large number of
cloud services are simply

161
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,140
managed service operations

162
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,039
of popular commercial
and open source projects.

163
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
And if those projects
have a vulnerability,

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,123
then the platform has
to deal with it as well.

165
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,210
So regardless, despite
all of the vulnerabilities

166
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,510
that have been dealt with,

167
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,310
there are still only been two breaches.

168
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,460
So lay that concern aside.

169
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,727
It's not a problem. And you
don't need to worry about

170
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,229
the cloud service providers themselves

171
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,293
as part of your security risk assessment.

172
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,680
So back to misconfigurations.

173
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,530
Part of the challenge
is the rate of change

174
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,643
of these four big platforms.

175
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,850
In 2020, the big four released
a total of 5,000 new features

176
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,150
over the course of the year.

177
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,719
That's a lot.

178
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,270
And when you do a little
bit of math around it,

179
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,010
it works out to a minimum
of two new updates

180
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,772
or features per day
for single cloud users.

181
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,870
I imagine that many of
you are multi-cloud users

182
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,930
and therefore the number of features a day

183
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,780
being introduced potentially
into your environment,

184
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,683
just exponentially increases.

185
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,750
That's a very high rate of change.

186
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,750
And the vast scale and speed
of the cloud service providers

187
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,173
makes it hard to manage.

188
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,260
Some approaches that we adhere

189
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,210
to organizations moving into the cloud

190
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,860
is that they want to take it slow,

191
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,130
because if they go slow,

192
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,580
they can minimize their risk.

193
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,459
There's logic there, yes.

194
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,390
But even if your team is moving slow,

195
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,560
the cloud service providers are not.

196
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,949
So you're only really minimizing

197
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,963
half of the risk in that type of concern.

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,530
Overall managing complex
cloud environments is

199
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,283
maybe a little daunting or overwhelming.

200
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,790
And we know that these simple
mistakes and configurations

201
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,026
can lead to just enough
of a foot in the door

202
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:16,473
for an attacker needs to wreak
havoc in your environment.

203
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,130
So,

204
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,040
fortunately, to address
some of this daunting task,

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
we have a shared
responsibility model for cloud.

206
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,609
This dictates how any
operational work is managed,

207
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,800
whether it's the responsibility
of you as the organization,

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,979
or the cloud service provider.

209
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,330
Now, remember I said that

210
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,320
security is part of
operational work for cloud.

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,690
That means that if
you're running instances

212
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,730
or virtual machines,

213
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,220
you're responsible for
the operating system,

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,077
the applications running on that OS,

215
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,050
and any data within,

216
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,109
including their security.

217
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,360
All the way over to the right

218
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,900
where you're in a fully managed service,

219
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,780
and you're only responsible
for the data being processed

220
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,563
and stored with that service.

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,630
But no matter what,

222
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,370
you can see along the bottom

223
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,450
that service configurations
are your responsibility

224
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,490
regardless of what type
of service you're running.

225
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,550
When you think about it, it makes sense,

226
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,240
no matter what type of
technology you're plugging in,

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,550
once you turn it on,

228
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,050
you have to set it up to
work in your environment.

229
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,839
The default configurations
are just the recommendation

230
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,483
but that might not be
what works best for you.

231
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,000
So what's the fix?

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,530
What do we do to address this problem

233
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,270
and keep these mistakes from happening?

234
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,480
Well, we're human.

235
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,520
Mistakes are going to happen.

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,439
But fortunately we can
put technology in place

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,890
that can minimize the risk

238
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,492
that these mistakes lead
to a security event.

239
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,920
And that's where security
controls come into place.

240
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,960
You're likely very familiar
with security controls.

241
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,050
We are in the security industry.

242
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,010
So you might be wondering,

243
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,890
well, these security controls
exist for cloud environments.

244
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,023
So why do misconfigurations
keep bringing the breaches?

245
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,213
To answer that question,

246
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,569
you have to start thinking
like the cloud builder.

247
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,770
And now I'm gonna ask you to remember,

248
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,500
a few minutes ago, when we
talked about the four boxes

249
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,980
and the seemingly disparate goals

250
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,830
between people in the
development and the building side

251
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,780
versus the people in the security side.

252
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,920
The goal of security is
actually really straightforward.

253
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
We are always working to ensure that

254
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,742
what is built works as
intended and only as intended.

255
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,130
The difference with builders is that

256
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,250
their focus is on just the first part.

257
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,300
They want to make sure that
what is built works as intended.

258
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,959
And in the cloud, they
want to make sure that

259
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,913
this is happening really quickly.

260
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,601
Why build in the cloud if
you're not able to build fast

261
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,730
and with a lot of agility.

262
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,863
And that's really a lot of the benefit.

263
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's kind of where the
initial disconnect lies.

264
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,720
The heart of our problem
that developers want to go

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240
but security says no.

266
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,420
And it's not necessarily
that we want to say no.

267
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,500
But sometimes you don't have a choice.

268
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,950
To ensure that something
works only as intended,

269
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,780
you have to make sure and
have a little bit of time.

270
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,230
So you might need to
say no or not so fast,

271
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,040
or you do something because
the builders have made sure

272
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,630
that it works as intended,

273
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,260
but you have to make sure
that it only works as intended

274
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,033
and can't be abused or misused.

275
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,703
In a traditional environment on premise,

276
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,900
a strong approach to security
involves a good perimeter

277
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,050
and deep visibility
across the environment.

278
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,890
Unfortunately, that doesn't
translate exactly in the cloud.

279
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,740
The perimeter doesn't
exist in the same way

280
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,310
because things are being
spun up and down constantly.

281
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,800
That teams are smaller and
building more and more faster.

282
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,870
And depending on how the teams are set up,

283
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,250
you might not have easy
access to the builders.

284
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,390
You might not actually be
able to put security controls

285
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,210
in place in the cloud environment,

286
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,223
which can make it difficult to secure.

287
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,430
Fortunately, there're two questions

288
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,530
that can help us think
more like cloud builders,

289
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,270
and start addressing security in a way

290
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,270
that will be meaningful from
the cloud builders perspective.

291
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,540
Those are, what else can this do?

292
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,392
And are you sure?

293
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,250
They're really simple questions.

294
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,010
I know, but as we go
through some examples,

295
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,490
I think it'll make sense
that these are critical

296
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,003
for making security controls
matter to cloud builders.

297
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,680
For example, the container
that runs the code

298
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,040
that pulls the financial reports.

299
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,073
What else can it do?

300
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,280
Can I access any other data?

301
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,579
Are you sure it's always
the right container

302
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,073
that is being accessed?

303
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,329
This is where security
controls really provided value

304
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,163
for builders.

305
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,140
As security teams,

306
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,870
when we talk about security controls,

307
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,020
we talk about all the
ways that they stop things

308
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,079
from happening because we
want to stop the attacker.

309
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,430
It makes sense for us to say that

310
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,609
using an intrusion prevention system

311
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,713
stops worms and other network attacks.

312
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,327
Anti-malware, it stops
ransomware and crypto miners

313
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,050
and any other malicious behavior.

314
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,099
And those are great for us
as the security experts.

315
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,770
But remember, builders
want to build and fast.

316
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,540
If you come in saying,

317
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,280
here's these great security controls,

318
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,890
they stop all the things.

319
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,220
That's not going to be
very interesting to someone

320
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,280
who needs to continue going constantly.

321
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,300
Those roadblocks are a major hazard

322
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,313
in the cloud development process.

323
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,930
But fortunately it doesn't
have to be that way

324
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,300
because security controls
can do more than just

325
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,120
stop bad things from happening.

326
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,360
They can actually enable us
to build better in the cloud.

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,220
We just have to frame them
in a different perspective

328
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,253
so that they have more
meaning to the cloud builders.

329
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,420
Let's go through some examples.

330
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,140
We're gonna start with posture management

331
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,819
because it's really the
cornerstone to addressing

332
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,760
our misconfiguration challenge.

333
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,160
We know that that's the biggest
security risk in the cloud.

334
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,910
So the thing to do to ensure
that that's not a problem,

335
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,203
is to have a posture management tool.

336
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,270
If you don't take anything
else away from today,

337
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,110
I have to tell you my secret that

338
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,213
this is the thing that I
hope resonates the most.

339
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,560
Trend Micros' cloud security
posture management tool

340
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,209
identifies more than 840
million misconfigurations a day.

341
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,000
So that's a lot of opportunities
for attackers to get in

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,610
if they're not addressed.

343
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,660
So with that type of scale

344
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,439
and all of the reasons
misconfigurations are a problem

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
that we've already talked about,

346
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,290
this is really a critical security tool

347
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,193
for you as the security person.

348
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,920
From the builder's perspective,
it also has a lot of value.

349
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,030
For one,

350
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,640
they're not going to have
to check that every setting

351
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,483
stays set every time.

352
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,450
These teams may be deploying
hundreds of times a day

353
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,900
and no builder (chuckles) can sit

354
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,520
and make sure that every
setting is right every time,

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,100
there are all the compliance boxes checked

356
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,890
and everything's in order.

357
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,160
That would be more than
a single person's job.

358
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,380
And it would be miserable
to make sure of that.

359
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,513
Fortunately these tools do that.

360
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,250
They also help with cost management.

361
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,950
It will tell you if something
is running unnecessarily

362
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,440
or in a way that could be optimized

363
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,653
so that you can spend
less or spend more wisely.

364
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,989
If you're in an industry
with any type of compliance

365
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,280
or regulatory measures,

366
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,350
this will also help you
if you're ever audited

367
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,560
because you can prove that
your environment is running

368
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,653
in compliance with whatever
measures it needs to be.

369
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,460
So, big takeaway.

370
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,210
Cloud security posture management tools

371
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,623
are hugely important.

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,119
Beyond that though,

373
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,179
despite all of the
value that they provide,

374
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,150
there's a lot more to
the cloud environment

375
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,033
and the rest of it
should be protected too.

376
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,349
Network controls assure
teams that only valid traffic

377
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,449
is hitting their code.

378
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,440
From the security standpoint,

379
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,800
only valid traffic means
that nothing potentially

380
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,610
unwanted or malicious is getting in.

381
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,719
But from the builder's perspective,

382
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,770
it means that nothing unexpected
is gonna hit your code

383
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,920
that will stop it from
working as intended.

384
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,649
So again, it hits both
points of our singular goal.

385
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,090
We're all trying to work to
make sure that things work

386
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,193
as intended and only as intended.

387
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,360
Application controls add
more of the same benefits

388
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,590
that building applications in
the cloud offer in general.

389
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,423
They help with the speed,

390
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,483
reliability and innovation
of cloud app development.

391
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,820
Including security as part of
the automated testing process

392
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,340
in your CI/CD pipeline upfront,

393
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,020
means that any type of
bug can be addressed

394
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,670
from the beginning.

395
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,710
Whether that's a bug in
something working as intended,

396
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,523
or only as intended.

397
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,389
That way something can be deployed.

398
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,220
A new app or feature

399
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,080
that can get out to your customers
faster and more reliably.

400
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,460
It means that there are no longer times

401
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,040
or instances where a new app is released

402
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,530
and security finds an issue a week later

403
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,060
and it has to be rolled back

404
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,693
or another update has to
be pushed out to fix it.

405
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,080
That's really unnecessary.

406
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,629
And that's the part of security says no,

407
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,430
that builders really get frustrated with

408
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,150
because their work is already
complete at that point.

409
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,203
It's out the door.

410
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,090
But there's nothing the
security team can do about it

411
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,820
if we're not built in to the
automated testing process

412
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,770
from the beginning.

413
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,300
Container admissions controls

414
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,409
ensure that the right
container is deployed

415
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,423
at the right time every time.

416
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,480
And container image scanning helps ensure

417
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,403
that only what is expected
is in that container image.

418
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,930
Snyk has a really great
report that's linked here

419
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,030
called the state of open-source security

420
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,910
and it's something that they run annually

421
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,560
and it consistently finds that

422
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,233
official container images
include a lot of vulnerabilities.

423
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,060
These aren't just any container images.

424
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,830
They're the most popular and widely used.

425
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,270
It's quite possible
that they're being used

426
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,773
in your container-based
environment currently.

427
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,560
But you might not ever be aware,

428
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,310
nor the builder,

429
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,649
if there aren't security controls in place

430
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,050
and unless a security incident happens.

431
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,100
That's definitely not the
time that you want to find out

432
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,780
that there was a vulnerability
in that container image.

433
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,260
So these controls can
make sure none of that

434
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,280
is gonna happen upfront,

435
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,123
before the container
image is pushed through.

436
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,650
In the same vein,

437
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,930
any open source software
can have vulnerabilities.

438
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,530
And you're likely aware of that.

439
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,790
Open source code is readily available

440
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,680
and heavily relied upon for good reason.

441
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,970
We use it in security
all the time as well.

442
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,560
But from the security standpoint
of protecting your company

443
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,590
and your environment,

444
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,312
it could be a big blind spot.

445
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,810
You might think about it as
having hundreds of developers

446
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,510
who don't work for your company

447
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,373
but their work is part of
your production code base.

448
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,710
That might be a little scary

449
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,350
because you don't have any visibility

450
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,800
and so what is there?

451
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,450
If vulnerability is found
or an update is pushed out,

452
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,223
you don't know about it.

453
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,139
If the builder knew about
the vulnerabilities,

454
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,520
they would likely fix it

455
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,990
but they don't have any
better visibility than you do

456
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,820
once it's out.

457
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,669
It's a dependency in their
code that will be built upon.

458
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,090
And unless something is
known to be a problem,

459
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,439
they're not gonna go back and
mess with it because it works.

460
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,290
Why mess with it?

461
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,600
So to address this blind spot
from a security standpoint,

462
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,050
it's pretty obvious why knowing about

463
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,120
open source vulnerabilities
would be a good thing.

464
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,239
From the builder side.

465
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,900
there's the added benefit
that these types of tools

466
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,890
can let you know if there
are any specific licenses

467
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,190
that need to be in place

468
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,460
in order to legally use that software.

469
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,860
That could be something else
that whoever the developer was

470
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,993
at the time, just wasn't aware of.

471
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,560
So it can cover a lot of bases

472
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,929
and make sure that nothing
is going to come in.

473
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,470
No attacker is going to
exploit this vulnerability

474
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,263
and hurt either teams' goals.

475
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,830
Security controls can do so
much more than just stop things

476
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,663
from happening.

477
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,199
They can help us answer critical questions

478
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
that builders are starting to ask,

479
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,543
like, what else can this do.

480
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,980
Very little,

481
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,913
because of these security controls.

482
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,062
But are you sure?

483
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,890
Yes.

484
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,563
These security controls told me.

485
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,750
Security can really be an
accelerator for cloud innovation.

486
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,400
It can help teams build
better in the cloud

487
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
when it's done well.

488
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,480
But for cloud builders
to really know that,

489
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,310
and embrace it in the midst
of their constant change,

490
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,810
among their teams,

491
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,810
among the cloud service
providers themselves,

492
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,300
they have to see that making security

493
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,480
part of the build process
is going to be beneficial.

494
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,390
We're not just the team that says no.

495
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,323
We can help build better.

496
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,919
To do that though,

497
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,863
we have to stop talking
about what security stops.

498
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,693
I know that's a little complicated to say.

499
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,050
That's fine amongst ourselves,

500
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,669
because as the security experts,

501
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,130
we want to stop bad things from happening.

502
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,940
But when talking about
it with other teams,

503
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,210
we need to say what security enables.

504
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,030
And show how security can
truly be an accelerator

505
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,183
for cloud innovation.

506
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,810
So how do you do that
in your organization?

507
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,163
Start by identifying what
all cloud services are there.

508
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,100
You likely have an idea in mind

509
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,639
and it might seem like a
silly thing to think about.

510
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,540
But I doubt how that all of you can say

511
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,520
with a hundred percent certainty

512
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,210
that you know all the
things that are making up

513
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,260
your cloud footprint.

514
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,200
Once you know what's there,

515
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,070
identify what security
controls are available.

516
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,530
The cloud service providers
are really helpful for this.

517
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,050
They can, they will absolutely point out

518
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,200
where security controls can be applied.

519
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,690
This is also a good point

520
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,840
to have a really strong
cloud security partner,

521
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,179
because if there are
security services in place

522
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,513
that are built for the
cloud and in the cloud,

523
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,459
then they're built or they should be built

524
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,490
to enable the cloud process.

525
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,790
No security tool in the cloud
needs to slow anything down.

526
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,023
So you want a partner who
isn't going to slow you down.

527
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,393
Once you understand what's there,

528
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,540
translate that value into something

529
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,663
that matters for the builders.

530
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,310
Ask, what else can this do?

531
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,193
And are you sure.

532
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,570
Think about how the security
controls can be an enabler

533
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,960
to the build process,

534
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,050
rather than a roadblock or
a hassle after the fact.

535
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,590
And then communicate that
value to the cloud teams.

536
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,663
I guarantee.

537
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,580
I highly believe (chuckles) that

538
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,810
if you have this conversation
about what security can do

539
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,639
for a builder, instead
of what it can stop,

540
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,900
it's going to be a much more
productive conversation.

541
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,450
And I bet they'll be on
board with security controls

542
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,663
when they're presented
in a different manner.

543
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,070
And then turn it on (chuckles).

544
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,020
See what security controls are available.

545
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,420
How many misconfigurations

546
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,370
does your posture management tool find?

547
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,409
Ongoing, not just upfront because
it should be automatically

548
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,910
running all the time to flag anything new

549
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,603
based on the new features from
your cloud service providers.

550
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,920
Once everything is turned on,

551
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,350
sit back and enjoy.

552
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,000
Work together ongoing with your builders,

553
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,950
and however your cloud team is set up

554
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,830
because I'd be really curious

555
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,510
what the return on investment is.

556
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,313
If you can calculate whether,

557
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,330
anything is X amount more secure

558
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,240
because of this new approach,

559
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,860
or if in general, it's just
easier to go about security

560
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,600
in the cloud because
you're working together

561
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,193
and it's actually part
of the build process.

562
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,800
Thank you so much for your time today.

563
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,230
I hope you learned something

564
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,090
and I really hope you are
enjoying the rest of RSA 2021.

565
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,280
I look forward to chatting
more and answering,

566
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,070
answering any more of your
questions in the chat.

567
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,903
Thank you.
