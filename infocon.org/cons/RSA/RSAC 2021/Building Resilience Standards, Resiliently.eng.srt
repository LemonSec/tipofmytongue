1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,790
- There's never a good place to start

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,640
a cyber security story.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,109
Technologies grow almost
like organisms do,

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,969
early, small decisions
have reverberating impact

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,800
as the technology matures,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,720
just like small changes in
DNA impact organic evolution.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,200
And this is particularly
true of cyber resilience,

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,820
the ability to protect, detect
and recover from attacks.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,210
Necessity is the ability
to look into the future

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,730
at what new threats you
will have to address,

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,160
and address them today

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,049
using the technology you bought yesterday.

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,870
Cyber resilience then requires
us to be able to adapt

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,400
our cybersecurity measures,

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,140
the way our early ancestors had to adapt

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,570
to changing environments rapidly

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,870
and without always being sure

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,250
how the decisions we're making today

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,130
will impact our capabilities tomorrow.

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,640
Here's an example of what I mean.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,473
We'll start in the middle of the story

22
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:50,702
of cybersecurity in 2011.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,059
Earlier industry efforts
to protect the BIOS

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,220
have been successful,

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,330
culminate in the publication

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,183
of NIST BIOS protection
standards, SP 800-147.

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,530
NIST developed the bios protection
standard collaboratively

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,180
with platform manufacturers,

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,730
chip manufacturers and now asverndis.

30
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,210
But experts agree there were
still gaps worth addressing

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,029
like protecting firmware
outside of the BIOS

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,380
and creating the ability
to recover automatically

33
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,803
preventing DoS attacks.

34
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,780
So, NIST convened industry
experts to create a framework

35
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,670
for protecting firmware on
a wide variety of platforms.

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,110
And this group drew on
existing industry practice

37
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,880
for securing firmware updates

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,679
and facilitating recovery
for a corrupted firmware

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,070
to create a framework for
designing systems resilient

40
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,970
to attacks.

41
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,179
On low level code, that would
leave the system inoperable.

42
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,020
This resulted in NIST
publishing NIST SP 800-183,

43
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,979
the platform resilience standard.

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,750
But what's most interesting is

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,090
that the platform resilience
standard is itself resilient.

46
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,370
And what I mean by that is,

47
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,520
folks have taken it and built on it,

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,060
evolved it to address new use cases.

49
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,260
It's been implemented in
servers and network equipment.

50
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,750
Others are applying it to
internet of things devices

51
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,670
and now there's new work

52
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,700
to extend firmware
resilience to 5G systems.

53
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,963
So, in this platform resilience standards

54
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:08,600
is a great example of
a resilience standard

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,340
that was developed in a resilient manner.

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,590
It was able to adapt
and change the use cases

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,240
it was addressing.

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,170
Its development was moved along

59
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,809
by shifting mix of participants,

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,570
each addressing their
own unique requirements,

61
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,859
had early implementation by vendors,

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,400
governments encourage use of
standards based approaches

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,490
that address the agreed upon requirements

64
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,560
and spawn smaller agile efforts

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,730
to drive specific implementation details

66
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,130
and communities of interest.

67
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm Jessica Fitzgerald-McKay,

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm the Kobe for NSA Center
for Cybersecurity Standards.

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm here today with my
colleague Mike Boyle.

70
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,070
And in this talk,

71
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,510
we'll study how the manner in
which a standard is developed

72
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,570
adds to its implementability,

73
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,370
its ability to evolve
to meet new use cases

74
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,480
and its ability to meet
past and current sets.

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,890
In other words, we'll discuss

76
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,083
what makes standards
development processes resilient.

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,570
But before we do that, what is resilience?

78
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,859
There's lots of kinds of resilience.

79
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,120
There's psychological resilience,

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,750
a person's ability to respond to hardship,

81
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,880
there's organizational resilience,

82
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,850
an organization's ability
to grow and to change.

83
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,989
And this usually relies on
the diversity of thought

84
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,823
and experience

85
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,710
and interest of the groups
in the organization.

86
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,870
Now, the organization helps
their people to develop

87
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,263
and to explore and to grow.

88
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,220
And there's cybersecurity resilience,

89
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,053
this is resilience

90
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,460
from a technological
security point of view.

91
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,630
A system is under attack
from an adversary.

92
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,490
How can we protect against that attack?

93
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,720
Detect the attack and
recover from the attack.

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,370
All of these aspects of resilience matter

95
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,310
especially in a pandemic,

96
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,210
but we're going to be
focusing on the last one.

97
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,790
Within the context of how
organizational resilience

98
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,910
impacts (indistinct) standards.

99
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,980
It's important to pay attention

100
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,230
to the psychological aspect though.

101
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,959
It's always lurking in the details.

102
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,863
So, we'll explore a little bit
of each of these in our talk.

103
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,450
We've got these swarms of
resilience to the hierarchy,

104
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,829
the people that make up an organization

105
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,100
have to have a certain amount
of psychological resilience

106
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,769
to perform well at their jobs,

107
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,470
and cyber resilience
relies on organizations,

108
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,670
especially vendors in the
cybersecurity industry

109
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,589
to create the products
that provide protection,

110
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,533
detection and response capabilities.

111
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,840
Because different
solutions might be needed

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
for protection, detection and response,

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,620
these products have to inter-operate.

114
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,150
And to do that, we'll need
resilience focus standards,

115
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,150
thus standards development organizations

116
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,479
and their organizational
resilience becomes important

117
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,423
to cyber resilience efforts.

118
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,450
This talk is focused on the
role that standards play

119
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,380
in creating resilient
products and systems.

120
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,360
So, in approaches to
developing those standards

121
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,530
lead to more usable
and resilient outcomes.

122
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,510
In the end, a good mix of
customers, not just a few,

123
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,550
but ones with a diversity of needs

124
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,010
and implementers is critical
to solving the problem.

125
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,039
The structure or process

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,860
within a standards
development organization

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,180
especially pertaining to
the cost of participation,

128
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,840
how the group makes decisions

129
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,390
and who members in the group represent

130
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,640
all contribute to the
diversity of the group.

131
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,650
The benefits of standards are many.

132
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,780
This set listed here all
add to the resilience

133
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,080
of a solution.

134
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,260
And each is important to the resilience

135
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,969
of national security systems,

136
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,980
which is the reason NSA
is engaged in standards.

137
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,813
Mike and I are the leads

138
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:17,837
for NSA Center for
Cybersecurity Standards.

139
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,570
And we established the center last year

140
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,830
to make NSA's cybersecurity directorate

141
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,200
a more effective participant
in standards development.

142
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,340
As a customer of standards,

143
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,169
we have a keen interest
in developing standards

144
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,210
that meet our requirements

145
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,479
to protect national security systems,

146
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,370
as well as a mandate to see implementation

147
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,930
and adoption across
national security systems.

148
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,540
And we get to draw on a large pool

149
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,240
of amazing technical
experts from across NSA.

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,313
So, just critical security
problems through those standards.

151
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:46,268
In this work,

152
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:47,750
we get to participate in a
wide variety of standards

153
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,310
development organizations.

154
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,840
Each has its own culture,

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,659
its own mode of operation
and business rules.

156
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,500
We've isolated four structural
or cultural variables

157
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,240
that influence the effectiveness
of the standards produced

158
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,690
by a standards development organization.

159
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,730
You have to note here,

160
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,780
different combinations of these variables

161
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,500
can be more or less effective
depending on the task at hand.

162
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,390
For example,

163
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,200
is a group trying to develop
a quick technical solution

164
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,700
or they're trying to standardize
the best current practice.

165
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,880
They try and create a
solution that be used broadly

166
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,770
and touch many people directly.

167
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,299
Each of these might
require a different mix

168
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,840
of these four structural
variables to get the job done.

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,260
The first factor to consider is openness.

170
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,409
Are there barriers to participation?

171
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,760
Do you have to pay to join?

172
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,120
How high is the fee to
attend the meetings?

173
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,750
How much work takes place
face-to-face versus virtually?

174
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,330
This is especially important these days,

175
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,430
but meeting attendance
is a continual blocker

176
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,410
even in non-pandemic times

177
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,823
for a lot of organizations
and individuals.

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,820
The second factor is types of membership,

179
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,130
who has a voice in the standards
development organization?

180
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,400
Do the participants
represent their country,

181
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,193
their organization, or
themselves as an individual?

182
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,700
The third factor is
how decisions are made.

183
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,300
Does everyone have to agree?

184
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,010
Are there votes? Who gets to vote?

185
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,870
Are there different answers
depending on the topic

186
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,700
or the stage of standards development?

187
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,670
And your instinct here
might be that full agreement

188
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,900
by all members is preferable

189
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,940
but there are pros and cons here.

190
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,620
If you need everyone to agree,

191
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,920
one holdout can keep
something from happening.

192
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,700
And the final factor we
consider is mix of voices.

193
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,300
Do the customers have a voice?

194
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,230
Do the implementers have to say as well?

195
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,630
Does the SPO encourage

196
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,620
or sometimes even insist on
interoperable implementations

197
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,000
before a standard is complete?

198
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,590
We, even as the customer,
isn't an end user

199
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,190
or procurement office, an auditor?

200
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,460
Can even be another vendor
building a more complex system.

201
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,530
The range here develops
applicability of the standard.

202
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,109
Customers can deal with a lot of great

203
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,190
but not very implementable features,

204
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,710
and implementers don't often
have a full understanding

205
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,010
of how a feature will be
used in the real world

206
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,960
or how can work with other
systems in a customer's network.

207
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,859
With those factors in mind,

208
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,580
let's consider some examples
of standards development

209
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,099
and how the outcomes were influenced

210
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,230
by the standards development
organizations culture.

211
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,930
I'll hand off to my colleague, Mike,

212
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,220
so he can apply these factors

213
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,033
to some case studies of
resilience standards development.

214
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,560
- Thanks, Jess,

215
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm gonna talk about three examples

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
of standards development efforts

217
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,610
that support resilient network operations.

218
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,820
We chose these examples

219
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,040
because of our engagement
in the standards efforts.

220
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
We got to see the standard being developed

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,920
as well as the end product.

222
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,420
Each of these standards is important

223
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,630
to our standard center strategy

224
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,033
for securing national security systems.

225
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,270
So, our first example involves
the Trusted Computing Group.

226
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,270
The TCG is a vendor consortium

227
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,670
with a small list of initial goals,

228
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,990
primarily focused on protecting
or measuring the bios

229
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,970
on commercial devices.

230
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,830
One of their cornerstone technologies

231
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,113
is the Trusted Platform Module or TPM.

232
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,290
As the diagram shows,

233
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,020
the TPM uses several
cryptographic functions

234
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,148
and protected storage locations

235
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:05,330
to take measurements on the platform

236
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,500
and report on the state
of bios and firmware.

237
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,460
This allows the TPM to serve
as a safe place to stand

238
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,403
and support a platform resilience.

239
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,180
There was little customer input initially.

240
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,449
Mostly the participants were vendors

241
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,160
who would provide parts of the solution.

242
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,020
This benefit of the work in
the SDO in the short term

243
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,770
as it was a way for the small
number of TPM manufacturers,

244
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,460
the small number of
operating system owners

245
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,560
and the small number of
major platform vendors

246
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,532
to collaborate quickly and efficiently.

247
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,483
But the downside was, there
was slow initial uptake.

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,790
There was a lack of applications.

249
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,310
There was a cycle of a major
operating system release

250
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,910
that was missed and there was
slow adoption because of that.

251
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,742
For a while,

252
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,280
the TPM was widely available
on commercial platforms

253
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,199
but very little used.

254
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,940
BitLocker was an early
and popular application,

255
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,670
but there were not a lot of other features

256
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,522
that an end user could leverage.

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,630
So, we felt that it
would help drive adoption

258
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,570
to share the TPM measurements

259
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,390
with other network applications.

260
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,223
Toward that end,

261
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:18,250
we participated in
developing the architecture

262
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,450
for reporting,

263
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,670
which is designed to
collect posture information

264
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,069
from endpoints,

265
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,500
either when they joined the network

266
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,400
or periodically while they're connected.

267
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,340
Assess that information and
determine whether it is aligned

268
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,113
with the policy of the network
in order to make decisions

269
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:36,850
on whether the endpoint
may remain connected.

270
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,810
Information that's
collected for the assessment

271
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,930
can be leveraged to
mitigate vulnerabilities

272
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,739
and target patching of software

273
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,033
that may be vulnerable.

274
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,550
When these health reports
were rooted in a TPM,

275
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,770
this was known as attestation.

276
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,980
There was always interest
within TCG in hardware support

277
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,620
for attestation to increase trust,

278
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,530
but not a lot of adoption.

279
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,459
The architecture had very little uptake

280
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,710
and eventually most of the
work group members left

281
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,210
the effort.

282
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,043
Ultimately,

283
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,270
it turned out that attestation
was very hard to implement

284
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,510
in a way that made
customers' lives easier.

285
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,890
Because it was difficult,
there was little demand

286
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,303
and therefore no real
profit in implementing it.

287
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,417
So, when we look at the
mix of voices and the TCG,

288
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,843
the work is very vendor-driven.

289
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,150
Member companies can
join at various levels

290
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,760
with varying financial commitments,

291
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,370
and they're able to vote
in work group meetings.

292
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,950
The board of directors is drawn
from these member companies.

293
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,680
They are very open to liaison members

294
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,739
such as the U.S. the government.

295
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,380
The liaison members don't
vote or sit on the board,

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,410
but we have never experienced
issues participating actively

297
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,403
and contributing to TCG work.

298
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,070
Possibly due to that vendor focus,

299
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,020
TCG as an organization is not focused

300
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,439
on the implementation of their standards.

301
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,900
That work is left to the member companies.

302
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,090
Standardization is
focused on the interaction

303
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,063
between TCG components and
the rest of the system.

304
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,520
Now, let's assess the culture of TCG

305
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,040
with respect to the four
factors that Jess identified.

306
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,689
There is a membership fee,

307
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,820
but governments and academic organizations

308
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,743
can join for free as
liaison non-voting members.

309
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,323
Membership is per company
or similar organization.

310
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,863
Votes are held and majority rules.

311
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,163
There are many more
vendors than customers.

312
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,609
To sum all that up,

313
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,060
TCG standards development can be agile.

314
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
They don't require a consensus,

315
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,579
vendors are mostly focused
on developing standards

316
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,890
that will create an
ecosystem they can sell into.

317
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,310
Lack of customer input
is partially responsible

318
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,593
for slow adoption.

319
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,780
The current state of TCG

320
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,630
is that they've realized the difficulty

321
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,280
in implementing TPM based solutions.

322
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,339
And they've worked hard to
make them easier to use.

323
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,160
Today, TPMS are widely available

324
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,530
and are starting to be used more

325
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,670
within emerging applications.

326
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,713
And we'll explore some of
these new applications next.

327
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,979
So, while the Trusted Computer
Group was developing the TPM,

328
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,360
other groups like the Fido Alliance

329
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,800
or Android developers
had developed mechanisms

330
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,579
for testing the state of a platform.

331
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,090
The internet engineering task force

332
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,280
remote attestation procedures,
and they call it RATS.

333
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,380
You'll have to work with
us to see that acronym

334
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,431
and those words,

335
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,870
(chuckles)

336
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,110
was formed to standardize
claims on evidence

337
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,730
about the system in a
technologically agnostic way.

338
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,190
This work is critical to spring
a marketplace of solutions

339
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,390
that leverage attestation.

340
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,199
Because it's technology-agnostic,

341
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,860
it requires a venue with
a broader set of vendors

342
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,420
not all trying to use the same technology.

343
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,810
It also benefits from
customer participation,

344
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,569
recognizing the data formats
must support information

345
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,130
that solves real-world problems.

346
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,810
The ability to attest to the
state of diverse platforms

347
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,713
is crucial to achieving
resilience at a network level.

348
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,030
IETF has a strong requirement

349
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,833
for interoperable
implementations or running code.

350
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,130
Within RATS, this has
resulted in a broad view

351
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,470
of what can be attested.

352
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,030
And participants have worked together

353
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,890
to abstract the attestation architecture

354
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,000
in a way that allows
for maximum flexibility.

355
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,360
The components of the
architecture can be implemented

356
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,213
in a number of configurations.

357
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:41,060
This diagram is just an
example of one of those,

358
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,619
and the functions can reside
on any type of device,

359
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
either physical or virtual.

360
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,060
This maximizes the ability
of the architecture

361
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,680
to be applied to new
and emerging use cases

362
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,853
as we see shortly and use case three.

363
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,410
So, how does IETF measure up
to our four cultural factors?

364
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,100
Well, IETF is open.

365
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,230
There's no cost to participate.

366
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,940
Attendance at meetings cost money,

367
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,890
but all business is done on mailing lists

368
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,913
that anyone can freely join.

369
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,833
Membership is per individual.

370
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,699
Famously, IETF operates by rough
consensus and running code.

371
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,620
This means that no one voice
can push a standard through

372
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,070
and no one voice can hold a standard.

373
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,480
The group must come to
a reasonable agreement

374
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,610
and need to demonstrate
that the agreement works

375
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,310
with the code they've written,
that work can progress.

376
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,220
There's a good mix of participation

377
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,810
leaning toward vendors someone.

378
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,810
Because of their focus on consensus

379
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,800
and the diversity of voices
participating in their work,

380
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,293
IETF has a good track record for adoption.

381
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,890
So, one of the emerging use
cases for the RATS architecture

382
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,673
is in 5G networks.

383
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,710
3GPP is the SDO of standards
have been developed

384
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,180
for 3G, 4G and now 5G.

385
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,750
The standard center is working within 3GPP

386
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,070
to leverage the rat's architecture
for remote attestation

387
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,923
within 5G networks.

388
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,610
There's a lot in the slide.

389
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,470
We're using it to drive our
attestation work in 3GPP.

390
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,920
And there is some complexity.

391
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,000
The slide shows IoT devices
attesting their health

392
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,910
to the network data analytics function.

393
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,689
This will allow the analytics function

394
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,070
to make connectivity decisions

395
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,780
based on the devices that
tested health status,

396
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,970
which could include device
ownership, update status,

397
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,950
configuration status and other things.

398
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,170
The analytics function
can share this information

399
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,170
with data repositories
used for network reporting

400
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,780
as well as orchestration
and management services

401
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,839
that make decisions about
network bandwidth slicing, etc.

402
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,180
Most interestingly though,

403
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,469
this data can be shared with
other analytics functions.

404
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,100
These functions drive machine learning

405
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,293
and artificial intelligence
on the network.

406
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,500
AI/AML functions required good
well-formed trustworthy data

407
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,569
to build models that accurately reflect

408
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,710
the state of the network

409
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,313
in order to automate
protection of that network.

410
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,300
Attestation can be used

411
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,889
to ensure that machine learning
processes are not poisoned

412
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,993
or biased by malicious devices.

413
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,300
Notice how these case studies
have built upon each other

414
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,180
and how resilience has moved up the stack

415
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,483
from platforms to network operations.

416
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,780
Now, to assess the culture of 3GPP,

417
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,940
3GPP has membership fees

418
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,300
and it's structured by
organizational membership.

419
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,490
It drives toward consensus
for technical studies

420
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,350
but majority voting is used
to choose work group leaders.

421
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,503
So, there's a mix there
in decision-making.

422
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,720
Membership is biased toward vendors,

423
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,690
but with significant input and
participation from customers,

424
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,580
this is perfect for a
new technology like 5G.

425
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,350
Vendor voice isn't necessary
for implementability,

426
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,453
but customer voices are
necessary for adoption and use.

427
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,980
What we've seen from these examples

428
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,135
is that the culture of an SDO
matters in the development

429
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,280
and of the standard.

430
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,810
Smaller groups can create
a standard quickly,

431
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,980
but it usually takes a group

432
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,780
with a greater diversity of perspectives

433
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,820
to create a useful standard that is fit

434
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,200
for a wide variety of use cases

435
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,030
and to evolve existing standards

436
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,373
to meet new cybersecurity challenges.

437
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,650
Now, I'll hand back to Jess

438
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,040
so she can talk about how
we apply the lessons learned

439
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,670
from these examples to
future standards work.

440
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,939
- Mike demonstrated how important it is

441
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,180
to consider the openness,
types of membership,

442
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,050
decision-making processes
and the mix of voices

443
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,690
in a standards development organization

444
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,010
when developing a resilience standard.

445
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,030
Having the right mix helps
to support complex use cases

446
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,410
that require participants to
be able to cooperate widely.

447
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,340
We can't lose sight though,

448
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,840
of all the other ways, we can
build diversity of thought

449
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,970
into the standards development process.

450
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,800
We need to be sure that the
greatest number of voices

451
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,820
are heard in the standards
development process,

452
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,320
that the process isn't dominated

453
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,330
by the most powerful contributors

454
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,679
and that customers of the
standards are considered integral

455
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
to the process.

456
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,250
This customer is often bringing

457
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,520
a diverse set of requirements

458
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,379
based on the environments
they're trying to operate in.

459
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,560
For instance, rural developing
areas may have needs

460
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,120
that are quite different from cities

461
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,850
within existing IT infrastructure,

462
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,740
particularly with telecom standards.

463
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,440
And those kinds of requirements
need to be considered.

464
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,430
2020 was a year where we all leaned hard

465
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,720
on new technologies to get our work done.

466
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,980
Virtual meetings became a way of life.

467
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,030
Our children adapted
to learning from home,

468
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,649
and our ability to
access data from anywhere

469
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,750
became absolutely critical.

470
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,920
And by and large, those
technologies met the challenge,

471
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,850
the occasional frozen
coworker on a virtual meeting

472
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,120
non-withstanding,

473
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,810
but they surely work to be done

474
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,899
to make this technologies even more secure

475
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
and even more resilient.

476
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,639
And standards will play an important role.

477
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,473
Over time,

478
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,570
customers would require greater
protection of their data

479
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,730
that's stored and shared in the cloud,

480
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,010
and new life critical applications

481
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,230
like those in the health
sector (indistinct).

482
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,670
The demand systems that
are highly responsive

483
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,793
and guaranteed many nines of uptime.

484
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,689
Looking even further forward,

485
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,140
decisions are being made today
that are setting the course

486
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,680
for future wireless networks.

487
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,466
And these decisions will
determine which applications

488
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:29,129
like telemedicine, autonomous vehicles

489
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,610
enhance virtual reality are
optimized for 6G networks.

490
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,530
The important question to ask is,

491
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,580
which stakeholders, be
it countries, vendors,

492
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,082
end users are being
represented in the process?

493
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,169
Using the model we described here today

494
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,460
can help us get ready to engage

495
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,450
in setting these requirements.

496
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,120
Today, the International
Telecommunication Union

497
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Standards Work group, the
ITU-T is the driving value

498
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,060
for 6G requirements.

499
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,500
Participation in the ITU-T
is through a country,

500
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,160
yours or the one you do business in,

501
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,600
there are fees involved.

502
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,830
Decisions are made by voting.

503
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,273
One country gets one vote.

504
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,000
And participation is
decidedly skewed to customers.

505
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,190
The lack of vendor participation

506
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,910
could really impact their solutions.

507
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,390
As you've seen here today,

508
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,520
for implementability and adoptability,

509
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,720
a standards development organization

510
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,044
needs an appropriate mix
of vendors and customers.

511
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,720
To get the right mix of
voices from customers,

512
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,220
cost and consensus are preferred.

513
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,690
Work in the ITU-T will
likely not provide that next.

514
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,340
And this could slow
down work on 6G systems

515
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,169
causing them to not meet customer needs,

516
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,210
not be able to be implemented
by vendors easily.

517
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,010
Based on our evaluation of
resilience status development,

518
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,780
we recommend the groups like 3GPP and IETF

519
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,913
take a larger role in setting
6G network requirements.

520
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,780
But this side is really how we,

521
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,920
Mike and I are applying what we learned

522
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,080
as a result of our analysis of resilience,

523
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,020
standards development organizations.

524
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,670
What would we recommend you
do with this information?

525
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,153
Starting next week,

526
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,170
we hope maybe you'll be able
to begin to thinking locally.

527
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,740
How can you increase
the diversity of thought

528
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,630
in your organization?

529
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,463
More importantly,

530
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,500
how can we ensure that
that diversity of opinions

531
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,353
are considered?

532
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,260
And think about cyber
resilience in your organization?

533
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,170
What are your critical cannot-fail systems

534
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,770
and how are you protecting them?

535
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,040
How are you detecting threats against them

536
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,822
and responding to those threats?

537
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,240
Over the next few months,

538
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,120
we'd like you to start regarding
cyber resilience standards

539
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,610
we've been discussing,

540
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,830
we'd love to hear your feedback,

541
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,639
particularly in terms of the applicability

542
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,860
to your organization's problems.

543
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,209
It's kind of like a natural
life cycle to standards.

544
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,160
And there's a really great chance

545
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,540
that each of these technologies
will someday be reopened

546
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,379
in some form for improvement.

547
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,550
Think now about what's missing,

548
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,300
more generally, what are the problems

549
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,649
you and your organization faces

550
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,310
which are not being addressed resiliently

551
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,513
by these standards?

552
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,040
Within six months, we hope
you'll get involved in these

553
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,810
and similar organizations,
standards efforts.

554
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,370
Expanding the range of ideas

555
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,810
considered in developing standards

556
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,860
such as these benefits as well.

557
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,179
Think about your 6G
requirements for your network.

558
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,260
What would you like to see supported?

559
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,410
And work within relevant standards

560
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,577
by which to contribute those requirements

561
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:13,870
and make your voice heard.

562
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,260
And of course, we'd love to hear from you.

563
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,930
To get feedback on the standards
we talked about here today,

564
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,140
please reach out to Mike and I.

565
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,140
You can reach us at
cs_standards@cyber.nsa.gov.

566
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,430
We look forward to hearing from you.
