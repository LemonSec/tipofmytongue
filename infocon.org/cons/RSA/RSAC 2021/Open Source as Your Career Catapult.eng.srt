1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,680
- Hello and welcome to our panel.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,130
My name is Greg Bell.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm a co-founder of an open
source security company

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,900
called Corelight.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,050
And I will be your moderator today.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,440
It's not a secret

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,059
that we're recording this event this year.

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,850
So please put your questions in chat.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,167
We'll be here to answer them

10
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,260
and to engage with those
questions in real time

11
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,370
and potentially after the panel as well.

12
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,440
But if you have questions

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,350
and they occur to you while we're talking,

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,880
please ask them we'll
be happy to engage them.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,669
Now, the idea for this panel came

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,590
from a tweet that I
happened to see last year.

17
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,320
It was from a Purdue university,

18
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,940
celebrating the
accomplishments of a student,

19
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,809
a young woman who worked on
their cybersecurity team.

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,780
While she was there

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,880
she added an open source
intrusion detection system

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,800
to the university's research network based

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,239
on open-source Zeek.

24
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,757
And here's what the
university's tweet said.

25
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,269
"This experience helped
Lauren land a career

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,170
as a technical program
manager at Facebook."

27
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,390
And I thought when I saw the tweet

28
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,070
that's a fantastic story.

29
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,990
And it actually made me wonder

30
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,670
if there might be some
really interesting angles

31
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,910
on open source that are not
getting enough attention.

32
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,649
There is a lot of
discussion, ample discussion

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,580
on open source tooling,
open source technology

34
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,440
open source business models,
a little bit less attention

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,021
I think to the impact of
open source communities

36
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:21,057
on the careers of the people

37
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:23,657
and the lives of the people
who get involved in them.

38
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:25,149
And that's an important story

39
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,470
and those impacts can be transformative.

40
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,860
So we thought we'd explore
that in this panel.

41
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,060
What we're gonna do
today is focus attention

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,000
on a powerful

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,480
but little disgust benefit
of open source communities.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,350
And that is to serve as a
force for social mobility

45
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,619
and career transformation.

46
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,330
It's my honor here to be joined by four

47
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,660
very compelling, accomplished
friends and colleagues.

48
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,500
Who've agreed to reflect
on this topic together.

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,150
You can read about their bio's

50
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,593
on the RSA website, their most impressive.

51
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,250
I won't repeat that here.

52
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,230
I will ask them to
introduce themselves briefly

53
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,710
when they first speak

54
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,869
but let's just jump
right into the discussion

55
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,380
because we have 30 minutes
or just a little bit over.

56
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,970
So I think to get us started,
I would like to ask a couple

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,810
of panelists to explain the
impact of open source software

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,970
in their own careers, just for
three or four minutes each.

59
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,320
And I think I'll start
with Bernard Brantley.

60
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,470
So over to you Bernard.

61
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,150
- Good afternoon.

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,983
Thanks Greg.

63
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:23,816
Great introduction.

64
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:28,770
So the impact of open source on my career,

65
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,470
I'm happy to say that without open source,

66
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,250
I would not be here today.

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,343
I don't think I'd be in security at all.

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,700
I'd come to a point in my life

69
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,560
where I needed something different

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,500
and all the things that I had been doing

71
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,370
before weren't working.

72
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,530
However, I can't abide
by the thought process

73
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,410
that what's always worked will work.

74
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,593
And because we've always done
it this way, you should too.

75
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,060
I got into open source

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,970
by finding a project online called Snort,

77
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,330
which sent me down the path of discovery

78
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,920
to understand exactly

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
what impact security would have

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,753
on the networks that we
have come to operate in.

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,410
I found that the great thing

82
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,000
about open source technology

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,680
was that I could take
what I wanted from that

84
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,823
and learn and grow as I needed.

85
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,280
I was talking to myself as a dreamer

86
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,590
which means I spend a lot of site,

87
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,640
a lot of time exploring different thoughts

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,799
exploring different opportunities.

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,650
And what open source allowed
me to do is to follow that

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,420
while applying my own
uniqueness and my own experience

91
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,589
to the outcomes that would come out of

92
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,260
my application of that open source project

93
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,000
to the things that I
wanted to learn and do.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,530
What it afforded me was the
opportunity to just go pick

95
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,130
something up that I was interested in

96
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,640
and read about it until I learned enough

97
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,209
to actually go and start executing.

98
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,850
And so, as I've moved through my career

99
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,710
I've looked for opportunities
to do exactly that

100
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,053
in the businesses that
I've been a part of.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,550
I've looked to build something.

102
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,870
It gives people the
opportunity to take experiences

103
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,899
of others have had, apply them,

104
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,250
learn enough to become effective,

105
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,490
but leave enough ram for them to grow

106
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,200
and to continue on to build
something that was unexpected.

107
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,240
I like to think that through open source

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,630
I've been able to leave the businesses

109
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,070
that I've been a part of

110
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,900
and the projects that I've worked in

111
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,799
in a better place than when I started.

112
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
- Thanks, Bernard.

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,300
That was inspiring

114
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,580
and I know I said it
wouldn't go deeply into bio

115
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,010
but maybe you could mention a
couple of the small companies

116
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,854
you've worked for

117
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:47,687
because I think there'll be of interest

118
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,393
to the people listening to the panel.

119
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,380
- Well, you know, I've been
in some interesting places.

120
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,909
I was able to instrument in networks

121
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,910
both Microsoft and Amazon,
and I'm now working as a CSO.

122
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,080
So this is great space.

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,000
- Thanks so much.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,430
Okay, let's turn now to Doug Burks.

125
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,160
And I think many of you will be familiar

126
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,660
with Doug's name and his
impact on the open source world

127
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
but I thought it'd be great to ask him

128
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,800
for his own reflection

129
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,393
on how open source has changed
his professional career.

130
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,303
- Thanks Greg.

131
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:24,860
I'm Doug Burks, I'm the founder

132
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,490
and CEO of Security Onion Solutions.

133
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,750
And I was introduced to free

134
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,950
and open source software in 1997.

135
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,950
And it absolutely changed the
entire trajectory of my career

136
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,543
and perhaps my life.

137
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,670
You know, I grew up on computers

138
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,670
and I kind of was had this
mindset of commercial software.

139
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,330
And when I found

140
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,560
that there was this entire sort
of parallel universe of free

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,350
and open source software,
it absolutely a revelation.

142
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,570
And so I got deeply entrenched

143
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,590
in the world of free and
open source software.

144
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,289
And first kind of starting off

145
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,390
with every single Linux
distribution under the sun

146
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,039
and getting my feet wet with
Linux and then getting involved

147
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,583
in individual projects along the way.

148
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,200
And, you know, over the years
I got more and more focused

149
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,840
on intrusion detection and
networks security monitoring.

150
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,609
And as Bernard was talking about

151
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,930
Snort as a great example
of a kind of a gateway drug

152
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,950
to, you know, a world of open source

153
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,113
intrusion detection products.

154
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:41,469
And so after getting involved

155
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,690
with that project and several others

156
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,030
including Suricata and
Bro, which is now Zeek

157
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,380
I really came to the point
where I said, well, you know

158
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,820
attackers, Red Teamers, they
have what was previously

159
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,613
called BackTrack Linux
now called Kali Linux.

160
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,870
But at the time back in
1998, excuse me, 2008

161
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,310
there really was no blue team

162
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,220
or defender equivalent of
BackTrack Linux or Kali Linux.

163
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,030
And so I kind of set out to build that.

164
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,000
So let's build a defender platform.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,640
So I called it security Onion.

166
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,099
And over the years, it kind
of grew and grew and grew

167
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,520
into this worldwide community.

168
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,020
And that helped me to transition my career

169
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,510
from some of the organizations
that I'd worked in

170
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,240
that were were great places to work

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,130
but ultimately I got an opportunity to go

172
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,373
and work at Mandiant a really
great cybersecurity company.

173
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,680
And it was through open
source that really kind of led

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,250
to that connection that really kind of led

175
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,410
to that kind of opportunity.

176
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,510
And then ultimately after a few more years

177
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,890
kind of as the worldwide
community of security Onion users

178
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,393
grew continued to grow and the
demand continued to increase.

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,460
It just became time to
really take a leap of faith

180
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,450
and turn that into a company.

181
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,610
And so in 2014, I did exactly that.

182
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,900
I started Security Onion Solutions

183
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,659
and we've grown every year since then.

184
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,970
And very happy to say that, you know,

185
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,940
based on free and open source software,

186
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,148
we're now able to support many families

187
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:28,270
in my hometown of Augusta, Georgia

188
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,310
and in many other States
throughout the country.

189
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,419
So it's been absolutely
amazing to be on this journey

190
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,650
of free and open source software,

191
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,230
really kind of taking me to places

192
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,853
that I never thought I could go.

193
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,410
- Yeah, thanks so much, Doug

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,100
that leap of faith that you described

195
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,900
as familiar to me too, it's exhilarating.

196
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,430
It's a little scary for
those who don't know

197
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,410
in the audience about the
impact of security Onion.

198
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,750
I think I read a statistic

199
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,250
that when a new release comes out

200
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,430
there's an enormous number
of downloads of the ISO.

201
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,469
Do you have, do you have a rough sense

202
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,220
of how many folks download security Onion

203
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,670
when a new release comes out?

204
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
- So I don't know the
individual download counts

205
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,900
for each release at the top of my head

206
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,110
but I can tell you that our
total number of downloads

207
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,730
to date is over 2 million.

208
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,380
- Wow, that's impact.

209
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,560
Thank you so much.

210
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,949
All right, so it was very interesting,

211
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,920
I think to hear about the
impact of open source free

212
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,683
and open source software on
those two separate careers.

213
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,930
And after hearing about those stories

214
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,319
I think our audience may be
wondering how can I get started?

215
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,230
I mean, those careers
sound kind of magnificent

216
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,600
from a distance, right?

217
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,580
It's always more difficult in real time

218
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,530
as you work through them, as
you take the leap of faith

219
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,980
as you make the risky
decision to start a company

220
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,630
or to embed open source

221
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,290
in a project that you're
grappling with at work.

222
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,160
So I thought I would ask
a few of our panelists.

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,730
How to get started with open source?

224
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,220
Fatema could you begin
by introducing yourself

225
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,350
and also giving a little bit of advice

226
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,600
about how to get started.

227
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,420
- Thanks, Greg, yeah.

228
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,252
Hi everyone.

229
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:15,420
I'm Fatema and I'm a
security engineer at ESL.

230
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,160
So I started my open source journey

231
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,520
with my first job and it
wasn't job requiring for me.

232
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,449
And at that time I was
pretty new to the business

233
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,220
and I was like, I don't
know anything about it.

234
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,300
And the requirement was

235
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,300
I was asked to write Zeek scripts
at that time we were using

236
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,890
we still use Zeek NSM in our environment.

237
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,189
So I was asked specifically to focus

238
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,690
on writing some Zeek scripts
to enhance the detection

239
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,780
of the project.

240
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,480
And I started doing that.

241
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,560
I started exploring, okay, what is Zeek?

242
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,079
And how can I get started?

243
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,210
And what all is available out there?

244
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,664
And how can I read through it?

245
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:54,990
And then sooner or later
I joined the meeting list

246
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,030
of the group.

247
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,300
And I started asking lots
and lots of questions.

248
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,829
I mean, all the dumb sort of questions

249
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,040
that one can think of.

250
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,030
I have asked it on the meeting list.

251
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,050
So that's how I got started.

252
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,870
And I was just like my background

253
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,160
even though it's software
development background

254
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,900
but my role was security engineer

255
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,260
and I was not looking for
building something up.

256
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,410
I was looking for using something

257
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,790
that can actually have my work

258
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,900
and grow me in my current job.

259
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,459
So there's this misconception

260
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,500
that if you are a developer

261
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,940
then only you can actually
start contributing

262
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,990
to an open source
project, which is not true

263
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,150
because you can contribute
in many different ways.

264
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,560
And there are different kinds of levels

265
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,989
of which you can actually
go ahead and contribute to

266
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,370
depending on your interest
and the time you have.

267
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,540
So you can be tester.

268
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,540
If you do not want to know
anything in the background

269
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,730
that what is happening behind
the curtains of a project

270
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,150
you can actually run the project

271
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,610
on your environment and see
if you can find some bugs

272
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,740
and you can file a really good bug report

273
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,260
which will be super
powerful to the project team

274
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,500
because they are desperately in need

275
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,480
of some projects that is putting need

276
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,630
of somebody who can
test their code, right?

277
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,439
So you can be a tester.

278
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,780
You can write if you want to use it.

279
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,120
And if you become a
pro user of the product

280
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,540
then you can involve more people

281
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,900
in using it and getting them started

282
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,199
with how you started with the project.

283
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,290
So this is another kind of
contribution you can make.

284
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,110
You can start doing the user
community for the project.

285
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,780
And then there is another
important aspect of it.

286
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,560
Like if you really are into writing stuff

287
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,449
like you are great and like writing

288
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,580
you can share your knowledge.

289
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,587
You can write blog posts that,

290
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,960
"Oh this is the cool thing
I found about this product.

291
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,950
And I was using this project
to detect this and find this."

292
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,570
And people find those kinds of stories

293
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,350
very impressive and interesting.

294
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,110
Because there are a lot of
people who kind of like jumped

295
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,900
into open source in the
mentality of using it rather

296
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,747
than developing it because
it's already developed

297
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,719
and they have extra pro developers.

298
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,950
So those kinds of projects
are always in need of people

299
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,320
who can build their user community

300
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
and who can test the product.

301
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,810
And you can contribute
in any way, shape or form

302
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,119
like you can contribute
in the documentation part.

303
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,480
So all of these small, small
things that people might think

304
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,130
that they are not contributions
can actually result

305
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,540
to a very important
contribution in a project.

306
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,620
And that's how you kind
of like get started.

307
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,320
And once you are started,
you will find people

308
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,600
who would help you to grow
more in that community space.

309
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,580
It's pretty impressive that
how are there different

310
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,500
kinds of levels and ways
one can get started.

311
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,820
And I have tried all of them.

312
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,835
So I'm like-
(Gregory laughing)

313
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:32,668
so yeah, that definitely works.

314
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:35,590
So this is how in my experience

315
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,300
anyone can get started with
the open source project

316
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,413
that they are interested in exploring.

317
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,252
- Thank you so much.

318
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,310
I think that's such an important message

319
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,910
that open-source projects
are communities of people

320
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,920
with different interests
and different capabilities.

321
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,870
And sometimes something
that might seem very modest

322
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,220
to a person like just reporting a bug

323
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,350
reporting that something doesn't work

324
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,690
or the documentation isn't clear.

325
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,760
It does an enormous
service to the community.

326
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,630
And it's one of many,
many ways to get involved.

327
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,410
So thanks for explaining that
Fatema in your own journey

328
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,030
into that community.

329
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,400
Roberto, I'd like to turn
to our fourth panelists

330
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,490
Roberto Rodriguez, and
I'd like to know Roberta

331
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,600
what's your take on how to get started?

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,260
How would you recommend

333
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,270
that someone who hasn't gotten involved

334
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,850
in an open-source community do that?

335
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,340
- Sure, hello everybody.

336
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,900
My name is Roberto Rodriguez.

337
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,363
I go by Cyber Wardog in Twitter,

338
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,750
and I'm also the creator of
a lot of open source projects

339
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,390
out there in the community.

340
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,550
Founder of the open Threads Research

341
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,630
also community as well
with the combination

342
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,610
of a lot of different
topics to do research on

343
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,550
and also contribute to the community.

344
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,209
Also worked for the Microsoft
threat intelligence team

345
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,290
as well part of the R and D branch.

346
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,069
So that is the mystic R and D team.

347
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,830
And yes, so how to start.

348
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,980
So there are, you know

349
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,810
like a number of ways to,
you know, to get started

350
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,750
at the open source, but to me,
like it depends on your time.

351
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,420
Depends also your personality

352
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,660
how you like to learn as well, right?

353
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
'Cause not everybody
learns the same way, right.

354
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,110
But I'm going to discuss
a few that in my opinion

355
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,500
have a low, you know, barrier to entry.

356
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,200
So for example, like, you know,

357
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,670
first I give you let's say are in school

358
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,130
or you're already working

359
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,840
whatever your situation is, right.

360
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,810
There is always an a specific topic

361
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,079
that you might be familiar with

362
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,290
specific type of technology
that you might be

363
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,360
you know, also more proficient in.

364
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,310
So I believe that the first thing to do

365
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,229
is to start exploring

366
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,910
and identifying other open source projects

367
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,280
that are related to that specific thing,

368
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,459
you know, that you might be

369
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,280
you know, like a little bit
more comfortable talking about.

370
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,240
And I believe that that will definitely

371
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,390
reduce the amount of time
to do research upfront

372
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,780
because it takes a lot of time

373
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,959
to try to figure it
out like this new idea.

374
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,730
So try to start with whatever
you feel comfortable with

375
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,950
like explore, you know, GitHub, right.

376
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,010
Try to type up your words that are related

377
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,810
with your current job, for example, right.

378
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,219
Second, I believe that

379
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,080
don't be afraid to just start small.

380
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,630
Like you don't have to create
a complete open source project

381
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,463
in order to feel

382
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:14,380
that you're starting
your open-source career

383
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
or your open source journey.

384
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,320
Well, it's not as a career
I open source, right.

385
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,550
But I believe that you
can start very small,

386
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,930
like try to identify,
following step number one,

387
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,880
identify those projects

388
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,270
where you can start doing
contributions either

389
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,640
in a form of code in a
form of documentation.

390
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,439
For example, Fatema said, you know

391
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,940
a really good thing that
sometimes it's, you know

392
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,887
your contribution is
just a matter of saying,

393
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:42,689
"Hey, you know this thing
in the documentation

394
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,550
could be improved."

395
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,959
This is something that, for example

396
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,140
you haven't mentioned yet in the project

397
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,310
those contributions are
definitely, definitely my opinion

398
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,359
very helpful, not just for the creator

399
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,110
but for the contributor itself

400
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,970
because you start learning
about that open source idea.

401
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,530
And then finally, if you really
want to start your journey

402
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,468
you have to also get
familiarize with, for example

403
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:06,619
Git commands, but you have
to learn your GitHub, right?

404
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,500
Because for example,
there is a lot of things

405
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,300
that I do every day

406
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,389
and there is always opportunities
out there to, for example

407
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,854
send a pull request or try to, you know

408
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:20,260
do a commit to the projects that I do.

409
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,000
So I believe that just
by knowing the basics

410
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,270
you will be very closer
to starting your journey

411
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,430
and trying to share what you're
contributing with the world.

412
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,050
Because it's great to work, you know,

413
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,379
like develop things on your own

414
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,830
and having working in your local computer.

415
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,639
But the best thing is
to start also getting

416
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,750
to know other communities
that are also interested

417
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,220
in the same topics that you're working on.

418
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,210
- Yeah, thank you so much, Roberto,

419
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,170
for that reminder that there's
a tool you need to learn too

420
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,680
GitHub and Git.

421
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,130
So that's very useful.

422
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,930
And there maybe, I imagine
some questions about that too

423
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,890
that we can tackle about
sort of how to get started

424
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,880
with the tool chain that's
necessary for this work.

425
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,430
So if you have any questions like that

426
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,970
put them in chat or we can
answer them afterwards.

427
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,350
I think I will ask Doug to chime

428
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,719
in on this question too briefly,

429
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,790
'cause he's seen a lot of people

430
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,210
get started in open source careers

431
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,510
and I know he has a strong position on it.

432
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,330
So Doug, why don't you tell
us what your position is?

433
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,629
- Yeah, you know, I've heard

434
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,870
it said quite often in the
world of computer science

435
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,320
that if you want to learn
a new programming language

436
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,233
you should have a problem
that you're trying to solve.

437
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,160
And I think that's a great
really kind of guiding point

438
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,670
for us in terms of how you get started

439
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,720
on your open source journey.

440
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,220
I think it's important to
have a problem to solve,

441
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,770
you know you could go out

442
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,270
and find some random open source project

443
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,450
and you could install it and
you could play around with it

444
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,200
but you're really only kind
of scratching the surface.

445
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,380
That's really kind of a superficial look

446
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,960
at that open source project.

447
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,660
I think what's a more
comprehensive way to get

448
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,580
started is to have a problem
that you're trying to solve.

449
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,770
For example, I mentioned earlier

450
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,010
that I found out about open
source software in 1997

451
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,860
and early on in 1998

452
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,830
I had a problem that I needed to solve.

453
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,659
My organization needed a proxy server.

454
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,960
We needed to monitor where users
were going on the internet.

455
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,560
So I learned about squid proxy server.

456
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,860
After that we needed a firewall.

457
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,223
So I learned about IP tables.

458
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,920
Later on we needed to be able
to monitor network traffic.

459
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,580
So I learned about Snort, Suricata, Bro

460
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,169
which is now Zeek and all these things.

461
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,660
So it was important to
make these things real,

462
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,670
to really put them into practice

463
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,150
to put them into production.

464
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,840
And you know, that makes it
so much more of a real-world

465
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,720
use case and that gives you
a much deeper appreciation

466
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,300
for the community, especially
when you run into a bug

467
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,010
or a feature and you have to
ask the developers about it

468
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,200
or you have to read the documentation,

469
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,320
maybe improve on the documentation

470
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,120
as we talked about earlier

471
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,360
but all of those things are key parts

472
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,669
of an open source community.

473
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,227
And it's really a great way

474
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:13,400
to really jump into that deep end

475
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,120
and get started on that
open source journey.

476
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,000
- That great, thanks for that advice.

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,620
Find a problem, dig into it and solve it.

478
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,580
Okay, I want to take a turn here

479
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,090
towards a different topic
of one premise of this panel

480
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,939
is that opensource can
accelerate not only careers

481
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,590
but can also be a powerful engine

482
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,899
for building a more diverse
workforce in cybersecurity.

483
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,350
And we really urgently need
more diversity in cybersecurity

484
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,110
in all of its manifold dimensions.

485
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,419
I think that's apparent to most
people who work in the field

486
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,550
and it occurred to me that
open-source can be an engine

487
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,690
among many others that
need to be brought to bear

488
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,700
on this problem.

489
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,980
So I thought I would ask
Bernard to reflect a little bit

490
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,810
about this angle of open source

491
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,822
as an engine for increased
inclusion and diversity.

492
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,400
- Yeah, great question.

493
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,790
I mentioned earlier that I was in a place

494
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,070
where I, you know no matter what I tried,

495
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,010
nothing seemed to be working

496
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,923
and that is born out of
the heart of coming up

497
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,649
in post financial crisis,
inner city, Detroit

498
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,830
and trying to look for
opportunities to do something

499
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,860
that would give me both a life

500
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,570
and a career worth living and working it.

501
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,270
And, you know, open source for me

502
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,901
meant I got to explore, right.

503
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,480
That I could pick something up

504
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,570
and then for no reason
other than I wanted to do it

505
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,260
or I wanted to learn it,
it was available to me.

506
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,220
And I think for the first time in my life

507
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,003
that was what held true.

508
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,560
And so I look at what's
available through open source.

509
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,530
And I look at, you know,
this concept of diversity

510
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,530
whether it be in the lens
of economic diversity

511
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,180
whether it's diversity of thought

512
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,310
whether it be diversity
of just people in general.

513
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,451
And I think about how we bridge that gap

514
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:20,960
and allow for people in each
of those different areas

515
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,460
no matter where they come from

516
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,540
or what they have to be
able to find success.

517
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,120
And this is a path, you
know, for no other reason

518
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,253
than a kid wants to pick
up something and learn it.

519
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,223
They can do it.

520
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,120
I think I'm a prime example of that.

521
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,120
And so, you know, going
through this whole process

522
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,810
I found that there's two key themes.

523
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,810
One, exploration and
interest are powerful,

524
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,110
But two, which is more importantly,

525
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,500
is that those of us who have
been able to learn and grow

526
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,720
through open source and some
of this is happening already

527
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,610
but just the importance and responsibility

528
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,580
of mentorship and leadership,

529
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,960
to be able to give back to those

530
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,470
who you see may have an opportunity
to grow or learn in this

531
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,600
or those that you see and
understand maybe struggling

532
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,709
that you can offer that guidance

533
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,760
and that we can offer
that leadership to say,

534
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,140
look you're almost there.

535
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,300
This is how this open source
project applies to you

536
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,440
or what you have available

537
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
or here's a different open source

538
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,250
thing that may be of interest

539
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,130
you're almost there and you
will not believe what's possible

540
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,733
once you get this nailed.

541
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,380
- Yeah, thank you for that Bernard

542
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,110
and for connecting that
with your own life.

543
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,500
I know you and I have spoken a little bit

544
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,150
about community colleges is
one potential ground zero

545
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,780
for that transformation
because they're low costs.

546
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,620
They attract all sorts of people

547
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,500
who attend according to their schedule.

548
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,670
And a lot of them just highly
motivated, really sharp.

549
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,210
And I'm wondering if you think

550
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,860
that that's a place where
those who are interested

551
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,820
in mentoring or enabling
the transformations

552
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,189
that you described could
attach themselves to.

553
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,870
- Absolutely, I would say
between that, you know

554
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,969
potentially high schools,

555
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,340
if you think there's opportunity there.

556
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,470
Find someone who is
interested and motivated

557
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,220
and just show them what's possible.

558
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,430
- Thank you so much.

559
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,270
So Doug, I'd love for you to
reflect on the same question

560
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,620
through the lens of your own experience,

561
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,030
which is different in some ways,

562
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,290
but also strikingly similar.

563
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,600
So I thought it'd be great
for the audience to hear

564
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,689
your reflections about kind
of the rural development

565
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,913
aspect of open source.

566
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,100
- Yeah, so I grew up on
a little bitty dirt road

567
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,510
outside of the little
town of Augusta Georgia.

568
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,180
We recently hosted a golf
tournament that folks

569
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,420
might've heard of, but
we're not really known

570
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,330
for much else outside of
the masters golf tournament.

571
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,350
We're certainly not a high tech town.

572
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,620
We're not Silicon Valley,

573
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,443
we're not Washington D.C.

574
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,870
And so, you know, growing up here

575
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,949
in kind of a rural, kind of a sleepy town

576
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,580
all of my friends couldn't
wait to get out of Augusta.

577
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,050
And I always kind of figured

578
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,659
that I would have to do the same

579
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,220
if I wanted to work for a real company

580
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,760
or if I wanted to even
start a real company,

581
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,580
but, you know open source
having then, you know

582
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,550
introduced to that in 1997.

583
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,169
And a great example is
just the world of, you know

584
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,300
I had always heard of
this thing called Unix,

585
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,050
but, you know I could never
afford to buy a Unix machine

586
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,480
to play around with it at house.

587
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,530
And if the organizations that
I worked for didn't have Unix

588
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,530
then I could never get
experience with that.

589
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,920
But then when I learned
about Linux in 1997.

590
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,250
Here's a free version of
Unix that I can play with

591
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,738
and I can get experience with.

592
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:03,850
And as Bernard talked about,

593
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,230
I had that interest
that eagerness to learn

594
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,200
and I could use that passion

595
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,440
and there were no barriers to entry.

596
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,360
So as long as I've gotten
the passion and the drive

597
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,679
I can go out there and learn new concepts,

598
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,580
learn new techniques.

599
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
And it's just such a force
multiplier to be able to not

600
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,500
be restricted to the funds
that you have available

601
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,500
in your banking account or
the lack thereof, right.

602
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:37,140
And so it's been absolutely transformative

603
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,500
to allow open source
to carry me far beyond

604
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,750
what my meager bank account
may have allowed me to do

605
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,990
or what my the dirt road that I grew up on

606
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,913
may have kind of led me to natural.

607
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,270
- Yeah, thanks so much, Doug.

608
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,340
And for the record you're
still living around

609
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,639
or in around Augusta, is that right?

610
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,110
- Augusta is my hometown.

611
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,659
It has been for 40 something years now

612
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,040
and will continue to be.

613
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,873
- Yeah, that's great.

614
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:06,910
That's inspiring.

615
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,500
Well, as we close the panel and turn

616
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,380
towards the questions I
wanted to give our panelists

617
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,960
one more chance to maybe give some advice

618
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,420
and to generate some takeaways
for all of you listening.

619
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,190
I'd like each of you in succession

620
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,880
to offer a single piece of advice

621
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,720
about how to move forward
in an open source journey.

622
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,590
And I think Bernard, we'll start with you.

623
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,620
What single piece of
advice might you offer

624
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,790
to our listeners and watchers today?

625
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,670
- Excellent, well, as I
said, I'm a bit of a dreamer

626
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,200
so I like to figure out
exactly what it is that I want

627
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,500
or what I see in the future.

628
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
And I apply that directly to my career.

629
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,219
What is the next move I want to make?

630
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,450
And if I work backwards
from that and understand

631
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,360
what the functional technical
capabilities are that I need

632
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,240
to get to that next place, maybe it's luck

633
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,170
or maybe it's just the way that things are

634
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,610
but I've been able to find
an open source project

635
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,439
that goes directly in line

636
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,730
with what that next step is.

637
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,070
So if I was to afford any advice

638
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,750
it is determined where you
want to go on your career

639
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,120
or what that next step is

640
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,350
and then find an open source project

641
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,649
that aligns with that
and just start learning.

642
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,730
- Great, thanks so much,
Roberto, over to you

643
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,600
what single piece of
advice would you offer?

644
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,060
- Yeah, so in my opinion

645
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,760
as you progress in your journey, right.

646
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,770
Start transitioning from
the contributor, right.

647
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,670
Being a contributor to
being a creator, right.

648
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,370
And just make sure that you
understand your licensing,

649
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,590
you know how you apply
things to open source, right.

650
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,699
That's always good to know.

651
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,810
The other piece of advice for me would be

652
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,852
that don't be afraid of
reinventing the wheel.

653
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,640
You know, don't be afraid
to rebuild in something

654
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,670
from the ground up

655
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,230
because you learn a lot by doing that.

656
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,400
And the goal of course, is
not just to do the same thing

657
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,580
and then just change
the name of the project.

658
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,600
But the idea is to understand

659
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,929
what it is that you can
integrate that project with.

660
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,490
For example, I have graded
a lot of source projects

661
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,260
around other open source projects

662
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,430
'cause they integrate very well.

663
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,190
You try to identify opportunities

664
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,290
for you to start developing
open source, for example.

665
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,659
And then also, so in
my opinion, once again

666
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,660
don't forget to learn
how to even use the tools

667
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,860
like GitHub and all this stuff.

668
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,169
And I want to keep saying that

669
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,730
because that's sometimes
it's a big obstacle

670
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,330
to start sharing, right?

671
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,669
Because once again, you can build

672
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,040
you can do anything you
want with open source

673
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,520
but if you can not share it

674
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,070
then it's hard to start
sharing, you know, getting

675
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,790
and it started building the community

676
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,720
that you might wanna build

677
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,860
also around your own contributions.

678
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,139
So, because you don't might not even know

679
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,720
but you might be one pull request away

680
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,930
from your journey in

681
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,730
from your open source journey.

682
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,287
- Yep, but you have to know
how to do a pull request.

683
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,310
(laughing)

684
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,320
That's great.

685
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,700
Okay, so Fatema, what one
piece of advice might you offer

686
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,693
to someone listening to us today?

687
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,100
- Okay, in the middle
of all the great advice

688
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,120
I would just say that, be curious

689
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,770
and ask a lot of questions and have fun.

690
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,690
And don't be scared and afraid

691
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,385
that what happens if
you break things great,

692
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,320
either you have found bug

693
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,909
or you have discovered something new.

694
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,040
So afraid to jump and ask for help.

695
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,470
And as I said, be curious
and ask a lot of questions

696
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,470
because you will be
surprised that, you know,

697
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,910
if you ask questions

698
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,630
there is open source community
out there who is more

699
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,060
than willing to help
you take your first step

700
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,820
because they need you
more than you need them

701
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,620
because that's all
they're made up of, right?

702
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,570
All the open source projects

703
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,480
great projects are made up of community,

704
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
made up of people

705
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,929
like you and me who
contribute back to the project

706
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,040
because if they don't have a community,

707
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,990
they will not be growing

708
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,620
and, you know, doing good in future.

709
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,120
So just don't be afraid.

710
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,010
Don't shy and ask a lot
of questions and have fun,

711
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,050
have fun have some creativity

712
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,450
and jump in whatever interests you,

713
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,120
find a problem jump right into it.

714
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,280
If you did not find any
open source project that

715
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,710
supports a solution for your
problem, you will be creative.

716
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,960
You've invented, right.

717
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Will be the next, next bigger project.

718
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,620
You will be the creator

719
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,429
of the next bigger open source project.

720
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,850
So just don't be afraid and be curious.

721
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,843
- Yeah, that's great.

722
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,750
It's advice sort of about
a particular perspective

723
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,680
almost taking joy and just having

724
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,290
having zero defensiveness.

725
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,750
And if I can embarrass
you just a little bit,

726
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,060
I reminded of when you sort of made

727
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,450
your energetic appearance
in the open source community

728
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,540
that I participate in

729
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
and I wanna say Fatema,

730
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,480
within like a year, a year and a half,

731
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,740
you were giving talks at
the yearly conference.

732
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,720
You know, you would found
a corner of the project

733
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,430
that needed attention,
documentation and extension.

734
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,420
And you were telling stories

735
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,954
about how you made that
contribution really quite rapidly.

736
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:01,161
It happened pretty quickly.

737
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,455
- Greg, I'd probably say

738
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,550
that I wouldn't be where I am right now.

739
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,190
If it wouldn't be open
source and specifically Zeek.

740
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,473
So I'm very proud of user and, you know

741
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,230
kind of the teeny tiny
contribution on the project.

742
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,190
I'm happy.

743
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,310
I like what I-

744
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,230
- Yeah, there more than
teeny tiny for sure.

745
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,360
Well, thank you so much.

746
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,663
And why don't we end with you?

747
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,430
I'll give you the last
word and then we'll move

748
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,491
on to if there are any questions

749
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:29,150
from the viewers but let's
start with some advice

750
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,550
from you about how to get started.

751
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,040
- Yeah, so a pragmatic
process that I have used

752
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,206
that I've recommended to others

753
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:40,140
and I've seen, been very
successful for others

754
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,330
is a three-step process, right?

755
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,790
Step one, in the first
week after this conference

756
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,899
I want you to go and
look in your organization

757
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,380
that you're in and find the gap.

758
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,890
What is it that you're missing?

759
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,723
It might be

760
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,740
that you're missing some
network-based visibility.

761
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,430
It might be that you're missing
some hoax based visibility.

762
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,360
It might be that you need some help

763
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,479
when it comes to incident
response or case management

764
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,010
whatever the case may be.

765
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,930
You've got some kind of a
gap in your environment.

766
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,350
So in the first month
after this presentation

767
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,040
I want you to find an open source project

768
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,190
that helps you to fill that gap.

769
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,820
And I want you to do a
proof of concept of it.

770
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,370
And hopefully your organization
has like a lab environment.

771
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,679
Even if you don't make your
home environment your lab right.

772
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,950
Set it up at home, get to know it

773
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,910
put it through its paces,
learn it inside and out.

774
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,380
And then step three in
the months, following that

775
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,090
take that proof of concept,

776
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,970
turn it into production

777
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,120
and demonstrate a quick
win to your management.

778
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,159
And, you know, do this in a couple of ways

779
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,380
show them that it's working
the way that it should,

780
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,670
show them that it's saving them money.

781
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,430
Get that documented in your annual review.

782
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,910
That helps when it comes
to salary reviews as well

783
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,530
and put that on your resume.

784
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,550
And that helps you get
better opportunities

785
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,040
for the future outside of
your organization as well.

786
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,290
And as we've talked about

787
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,190
you know, in addition
to that, if you don't

788
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,810
find an open source
project that fills that gap

789
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,909
now you've identified
an opportunity to start

790
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,377
a brand new open source project

791
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:22,279
and that can open all kinds of doors

792
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,239
including starting your own company

793
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,122
and really changing the
trajectory of your career.

794
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,949
- Awesome, thank you, Doug.

795
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:32,580
That's a very clear three-part
strategy for folks to adopt.

796
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,670
And as he mentioned at
the end, as Doug mentioned

797
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,469
there's sort of, if you
find a project that's great

798
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,303
you can contribute to it.

799
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:40,009
If there's none, then there's a gap.

800
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,800
So either outcome is really good.

801
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,320
I want to thank all of
our panelists so much

802
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,010
for their candor and their thoughtfulness.

803
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,460
This was an awesome discussion.

804
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I hope that you heard something
here that inspired you

805
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,420
or nudged you forward a
little pushed you forward

806
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,850
something that sticks in your brain.

807
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,630
I sincerely hope so.

808
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,860
And now it is time to hear from you.

809
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,320
Our panelists would be
happy to get feedback,

810
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,280
obviously in chat and
perhaps we'll even have time

811
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,820
to have some dialogue in real time.

812
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,950
And if not, I'm sure
that they'd appreciate

813
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,700
being contacted out of band as well.

814
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,689
You can read their bios
for information about that,

815
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,050
but in the meantime, thank you so much

816
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,270
for attending our panel.

817
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,160
And I truly hope that you
find a meaningful relationship

818
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,920
with an open source project in the future.

819
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,753
Take care.
