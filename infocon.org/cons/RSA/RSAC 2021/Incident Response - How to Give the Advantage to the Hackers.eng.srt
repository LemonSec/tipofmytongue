1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,309
- Hey, it's great to be here today.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,337
We're gonna to talk about
incident response today and

3
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,913
how to give the advantage to the hackers.

4
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:09,560
It's a great learning experience.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,700
I hope you enjoy it as much

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,280
as my co-speaker Dave Estlick and I will.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,660
This is James Christiansen.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,520
I am VP of the Global Strategy
Group here at Netskope.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,020
A long history and as a practitioner

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,689
as a CSO for FISA, General
Motors, and Experian.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,290
I'm really excited to
talk about this today.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,323
With that, Dave.

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,930
- Hi, I'm Dave Estlick.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm the Global Chief
Information Security Officer

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,250
for Chipotle Mexican Grill.

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,840
I've also served as CSO for Starbucks

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,070
and PetSmart before that.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,913
Glad to be here.

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,593
- Great, so with that,
we're gonna get started

20
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:50,670
First, I just want to go through,

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,220
although this is more
of an advanced session

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,600
on incident response, and we're going to

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,970
get down to the gritty,

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,800
don't want to leave back the basics.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,580
So, you know, if you think
about incident response

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,660
there's actually a very useful process.

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,550
This comes in at SP 861, and
it's really about preparation.

28
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,250
And Dave and I will talk a lot

29
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,060
about the importance of
preparation and getting ready

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,340
for the live thing, and
then detection analysis.

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,190
You know, it's detecting that breach

32
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,070
and then trying to figure
out and make sense of it.

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,949
And you'll see from our conversation

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,520
just how difficult that can
be in the middle of a breach

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,770
and how that planning will come back in.

36
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,350
And as you're doing your
analysis, you're going to

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,240
start your containment
and eradication recovery.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,440
But this is a reoccurring loop.

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,810
You're gonna find things
as you're going through

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,440
this incident you didn't know
you had in the beginning.

41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,730
So as you're thinking about this process,

42
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,530
do recognize that it is
going to be repetitive

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,130
as you go through this loop.

44
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,370
At the end, you're gonna
do a post-incident review.

45
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,180
That's kind of like the post
game show in the Super Bowl.

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,090
You learn from it.

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,930
You correct from your mistakes.

48
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,950
You might do additional
training, et cetera.

49
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,960
So, that's what we're
going to talk a little bit

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,720
about today is just how
effective this process can be.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,930
The other important aspect of preparing

52
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,510
for an incident is having
an incident response team.

53
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,549
You know, the common research says,

54
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,203
this is one of the most significant things

55
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,230
you can do to reduce the
cost of a security breach.

56
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,310
That team is gonna be made
up of key stakeholders.

57
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,090
You're gonna want legal on that team.

58
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,030
You're gonna want your
public relations on the team.

59
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,450
Of course you and the security team,

60
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,450
maybe some of your direct
technology, the IT group,

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,910
customer service because they're going

62
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,490
to be part of that
notification in the end,

63
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,620
and some of your key business leaders.

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,960
This team is really meant so
that as you get into a breach,

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,700
they've already been notified.

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,480
They already understand how to
do things and who does what.

67
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Not only is it important
to know what their role is,

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,260
it's also really important
to know what their role isn't

69
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,250
and who's gonna talk to the press,

70
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,600
who's gonna talk to board members,

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,410
who's gonna talk to the executives

72
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,100
and your own internal staff.

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,170
That becomes a key
important element of part

74
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,549
of incident response.

75
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,820
So having this formable response team

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,500
is absolutely critical to your success.

77
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,107
- Well, and the one thing
that I would add there is

78
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:23,900
try to keep that group
as tight as possible,

79
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,180
recognizing that in the
event that this becomes

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,890
a large scale public event,

81
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,859
all of those individuals can be deposed.

82
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,160
So there's going to be a lot of pressure

83
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,500
and people that want to be in the know

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,385
and want to be part of
the team, but really

85
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:46,385
ask yourself who is critical
to be part of that team,

86
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,940
and as things change, if you
need to bring people in later

87
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,903
and read them in, that's okay.

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,090
- Oh, absolutely great point, Dave,

89
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,450
because as it's unfolding there's

90
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,600
a lot of misinformation
you're going to get

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,299
and you're going to handle
as a chief security officer

92
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,700
or head of an incident response team.

93
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,190
So understanding what's going
to be real as you go through,

94
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,250
so that keeping that tightly closed.

95
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,280
One of the other recommendations I usually

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,290
make is get it under
client-attorney very early on.

97
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,399
It is absolutely qualifies
because this could result

98
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,470
in illegal action later.

99
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,722
So getting your attorney to get

100
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,859
everyone under attorney-client,

101
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,197
again is a way to kind
of minimize that impact

102
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:33,390
and stop disinformation from
getting out in the public

103
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,700
because that can be a huge hit

104
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,293
to your brand, your brand name.

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,060
With that, let's talk about
the presentation today

106
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,070
and what it means to give
the advantage to the hackers,

107
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,400
and just due to things that'll
happen you didn't plan for,

108
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,150
or maybe you did and
they just go differently.

109
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,099
That inability to distinguish
what activities are normal

110
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,010
for your infrastructure.

111
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,603
Not being prepared and
having everything lined up.

112
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,570
Running out of energy
before the bad guys do.

113
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,880
Now, lack of appreciation,
just how difficult

114
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,360
to stop an ongoing attack
and how long it may take,

115
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,400
and then managing upward and being able

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,960
to communicate effectively
with your management team.

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,229
Those were the essence of the case studies

118
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,060
we're gonna walk you through now.

119
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,133
- So the first problem area,

120
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:26,810
the inability to distinguish
what activities are normal

121
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,580
for your infrastructure,

122
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,300
and the way that we've structured

123
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,950
the remainder of the presentation
is kind of scenario-based,

124
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,303
so we're gonna walk
through some scenarios,

125
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:43,300
talk about the gotcha in that
scenario and some things,

126
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,447
some considerations and
areas to address that.

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,760
So, first scenario, we have our reports

128
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,760
of inoperative systems and
an accompanied ransom note.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,270
So this is, you know this scenario is

130
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,863
all too common in today's world.

131
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,800
The gotcha: you're unable to access,

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,910
payment demands are made,

133
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,090
and there's escalation over time.

134
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,852
So we've seen this a
lot in the news of late.

135
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,919
You as a leader in your organization,

136
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,920
what you should be doing about
this is conducting tabletops.

137
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,730
Make sure that the organization
understands and is aware.

138
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,890
Segmentation to prevent spread of malware

139
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,930
throughout your environment.

140
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,390
You need to ask yourself, do
you have robust backup systems?

141
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,390
So can you recover if
your leadership has said

142
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,350
that you will not pay the ransom?

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,250
And within the tabletop exercise

144
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,410
you should have a scenario
that you run through

145
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,290
with your executive team so
that you understand in advance,

146
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,480
will you pay the ransom or not?

147
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,990
And if you do, have you done
the things that you need to

148
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,010
in preparation for that?

149
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,462
So do you have a Coinbase account?

150
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:26,210
Have you acquired cryptocurrency?

151
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,640
These are all things
that you do not want to

152
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,772
be doing under crisis.

153
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
- Yeah, that's absolutely right, David.

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,730
I mean, this is typical ransomware,

155
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,010
and we're seeing so much of it these days

156
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,440
and it's being very targeted
even by industry sectors.

157
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,520
So making sure that you
thought this thing through

158
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,599
and you discussed it with your exec team

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,220
because they need to understand

160
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,440
in this essence what the
business impact is going to be,

161
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,710
how we'll pay the ransom,
as I think you pointed out,

162
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,169
having a crypto account
in case you do want to,

163
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,440
all these things need to be
done in advance because often

164
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,260
these ransom demands are
based on time as well.

165
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,500
You only have so much time to
react then the price goes up.

166
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,430
So it truly is,

167
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,810
it's a harrowing
experience to live through.

168
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,380
Hopefully you won't be there,

169
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,190
but I think this is some
really good information

170
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,010
on how to prepare for that.

171
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,360
- Yeah, and the one last item here is,

172
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,760
and I've done this in tabletop exercises,

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,030
is really skew it to where

174
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,309
the ransom demand is relatively

175
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,559
or extraordinarily small
compared to the business impact.

176
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,276
Executives have a tendency to say,

177
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:46,787
"Yeah, absolutely, we're
not going to do that."

178
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,080
But you really want to be able to

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,497
have a meaningful conversation to say,

180
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:59,497
"Really if they're only
asking for say thousands

181
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,700
for a line of business that
may be generating millions

182
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,060
would it be worth just the shot?"

183
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,630
Cause there's no guarantee that

184
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,489
you'll get recovery through ransom,

185
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,150
but what's important is to make sure

186
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,150
that the executive team really
considers it as a option.

187
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,630
And then you can figure out,
at least then what the ethos

188
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,633
of the company is and respond accordingly.

189
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,900
- Yeah, and of course our gut
reaction as security people,

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,449
we don't want to pay the ransom.

191
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,830
We don't want to reward
people for this behavior,

192
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,990
but this is now a business decision

193
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,910
that needs to be made
and made in concurrent

194
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,860
with the entire organization
and the culture.

195
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,610
Let me move on to the next one, Dave

196
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,603
and let's go through this one.
- You bet.

197
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,792
- So scenario B, we have an event.

198
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,910
Is it something that's
worth investigating?

199
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,964
We all suffer for around issues of scale

200
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,700
and separating signal from noise

201
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,603
is becoming increasingly more difficult.

202
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,063
Your IR team is more of a virtual team,

203
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,319
and they don't have time
to track down every alert

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,900
and alarm that is gonna
come across their desk,

205
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,563
so prioritization is crucial.

206
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,160
The lesson learned here is make sure

207
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,203
that you preserve capacity
for this particular team.

208
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,949
One, you can never schedule
events that are gonna come

209
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,020
at the absolute worst time.

210
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,579
Your IR team has the potential of being

211
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,580
overloaded and as such, when
they become tired and stressed,

212
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,190
that's when you can start dropping balls

213
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,760
and miss critical items.

214
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,040
Likewise, if they're running
down every alert and alarm

215
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,449
and if you have a high degree

216
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,130
of false positives in the system,

217
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,870
that leads to complacency.

218
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,677
They'll look at that and say,

219
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:15,870
"Yeah, no, no, I think that
that's just a false positive"

220
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,943
without truly running that down.

221
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,589
And then the last item here
is to make sure that you have

222
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,030
excess capacity for burst requirements.

223
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,689
I myself have two to three
companies on retainer

224
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,607
to make sure that if we're underwater,

225
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,223
that we can burst,

226
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,719
because as we've said before,

227
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,650
when it rains, it pours.

228
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,120
You're gonna see that incidents
end up coming in groups

229
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,300
and make sure that you
have the needed capacity

230
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,293
to address the critical items.

231
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,660
- Well, you know, Dave's right there,

232
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,689
this is a place in my entire career

233
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,790
I've always made sure I
had the multiple retainers

234
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,439
that you just talked about

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,950
because when it hits,

236
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,940
and it's going to hit hard

237
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,307
and there's no way you're going to staff

238
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,840
for that kind of event,
you're just never going to

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,500
maintain that kind of people resource.

240
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,150
So having these experts
come in, come in quickly.

241
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,079
I recommend as part of that retainer,

242
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,580
they already know your systems.

243
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,850
You've already met with them,
they understand what kind

244
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,610
of operating systems you've run,

245
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,830
where your network entry points are.

246
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,040
They should be very familiar
with your environment

247
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,410
because you can't take
the time to get them

248
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,670
up to speed in these moments.

249
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,360
Because minutes matter in
these events, you know?

250
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,730
You're hemorrhaging data, you
need to find out the leak,

251
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,950
you need to get it under control

252
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,890
and minimize any damage
that might be done.

253
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,220
So, that's one of the other side,

254
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,330
and of course the opposite is you can't

255
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,330
be chasing your tail.

256
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,340
And this is where I think having really

257
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,410
good forensics data
available to you at a touch.

258
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,910
So, think about, you
know, the past, of course

259
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,699
our forensics and now it's cloud access,

260
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,620
how that forensics information has changed

261
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,510
and making sure your staff is up to speed

262
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,319
on both as it comes to
being able to quickly

263
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,380
understand where these
different events are originating

264
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,680
from and the extent of that damage.

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,150
All right, so we're gonna
switch gears here a little bit.

266
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,819
Now, the second problem is really about

267
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,850
making sure you've got your ducks in a row

268
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,250
and that you are ready for this incident.

269
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,525
So with this first scenario,
I'm gonna talk about,

270
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,209
you know, right along the same line,

271
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,010
we were just talking about:
getting help from your vendors.

272
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,130
Now we just talked about incident response

273
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,670
or business recovery teams help,

274
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,229
but you're in a very
connected world these days.

275
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,960
We have a lot of third
parties that are part

276
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,640
of our infrastructure and
part of our solutions.

277
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,069
So making sure you've got the ability

278
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,580
to get them on the line.

279
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,230
Of course the gotcha here
is you don't know where

280
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,063
that list is.

281
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:57,630
You don't have that contact information.

282
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,570
Again, this is not the right
time to start discovery.

283
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,550
So making sure you've
thought of that through,

284
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,449
you have these emergency contacts on

285
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,460
ready at your finger trips.

286
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,070
And remember it's gotta
be somewhere local because

287
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,230
if your systems are going down,

288
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,130
you may not be able to get
to 'em to understand this.

289
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,780
So making sure you've got
a second route to this

290
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,270
kind of information is vitally important.

291
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,900
- Yeah, and so true.

292
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,030
Geography matters, right?

293
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,089
So you may not be able to get to those

294
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,970
because they're in a neighboring state,

295
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,702
but similarly, if you're
a global multinational,

296
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:39,350
right, that could be several flights away.

297
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,760
So make sure that you
have the right contacts

298
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,410
in geography, in country,

299
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,030
and that also includes law enforcement.

300
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,980
So make sure that you do
that work upfront so that

301
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,733
you have those at a fingertip
when they're needed.

302
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,480
- Great tip Dave.

303
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,450
Yeah, we don't wanna
forget law enforcement

304
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,990
and your legal counsel on
these things, both internal

305
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,100
and external counsel, making
sure they're all ready to go

306
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,443
and that you can turn to
'em at the time of need.

307
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,460
So I'm gonna jump to the next scenario.

308
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,300
And this next scenario is
really about, you know,

309
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,349
you've got this evidence that,
you know, your admin levels

310
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,400
you know, admin passwords
may have been hacked.

311
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,610
And this, again, isn't
all that uncommon where

312
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,460
you may have gotten pretty
deep in your systems.

313
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,660
So you know that the gotcha
here is often you'll see

314
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,219
in many organizations
that admin password is

315
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,970
used the same password on
numerous systems that are critical

316
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,600
and often shared amongst a lot of people

317
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,530
as they do their systems support,

318
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,752
which is always a
headache for me as a CSO,

319
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,440
when I have these shared IDs

320
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,540
that are really privileged accounts,

321
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,860
but in this case, the scenario is around

322
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,360
that they've been compromised.

323
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,050
So we need to have a process
and be able to be prepared

324
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,430
to be able to reissue
these admin passwords

325
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,593
at a moment's notice.

326
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,610
Now think about that even a little broader

327
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,940
and you may get like WannaCry
in a variant of WannaCry,

328
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,550
and you're seeing that spread very quickly

329
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,709
through your network is that a thing takes

330
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,410
off and suddenly you're seeing

331
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,420
whole segments of your network.

332
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,689
Another thing that we
looked really closely at

333
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,610
and managed was network segmentation.

334
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,500
So if I had to completely cut a segment

335
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,550
off to protect the rest
of the world, I could.

336
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,599
Of course I couldn't do that at the time.

337
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,840
I had to have those things in place.

338
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,980
One of our colleagues even
has a complete red button

339
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,990
that says, "Shut it all down."

340
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,420
And what that gives him
is the ability to actually

341
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,640
isolate the different business units

342
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,370
around the world to protect that spread

343
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,083
of these kinds of viruses.

344
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,530
- In these scenarios,
relationships are key.

345
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,459
So it's important to establish
the business relationships

346
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,310
ahead of time for the types of actions

347
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,470
that you may be required to take,

348
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,390
whether that's cutting
off a network segment.

349
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,859
Make sure that your leadership understands

350
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,829
that that possibility may exist

351
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,550
and that it's clear when

352
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,659
those actions will be taken,

353
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,609
so that you're not running
around looking for approval

354
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,859
or looking to understand
in the midst of crisis.

355
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,719
I had a scenario in a prior life where

356
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,280
I had to reset all credentials.

357
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
It happened at three
o'clock in the morning.

358
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,350
After several days of an incident,

359
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,159
I went home to catch a few hours shut eye.

360
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,990
When I came back I was expecting
the worst professional day

361
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,650
of my career and much to my surprise,

362
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,787
I didn't get anybody coming
into my office saying,

363
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:59,490
"What did you do and why did you do this?"

364
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,560
Not to say that that didn't happen,

365
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,940
but the leadership team was aware

366
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,940
that the scenario was a possibility
and actually shielded me

367
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,987
from the pushback in
the organization saying,

368
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:19,100
"No, if security deems this necessary,

369
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,340
then there's a reason for this."

370
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,419
And that all came.

371
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,640
That was all a result of relationships

372
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,630
and hard work prior to the incident.

373
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,103
- Yeah, absolutely.

374
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,530
The next scenario we're
gonna review for you

375
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,570
is really around a breach,

376
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,460
and especially in the early days,

377
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,210
you're getting a lot of information

378
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,880
and nobody's certain about anything.

379
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,647
If I had a nickel for
every time somebody said,

380
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,899
"I think it's this, but I'm not sure."

381
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,260
Well, trying to make a decision
with imperfect information

382
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,330
on what to do next is always difficult.

383
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,689
And in this time, remember
any decision you make

384
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,030
now in two seconds is going to
be reviewed for three months.

385
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,649
So being ready to make these decisions

386
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,090
with imperfect information is a sign

387
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,070
of a good incident response leader.

388
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,480
The ability to distinguish
noise from reality

389
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,830
and make those next steps to
both preserve the evidence

390
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,210
and to protect the business
you need for ongoing.

391
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,780
So you're gonna get a lot of assumptions.

392
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,560
You're getting a lot of
this imperfect information.

393
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,379
So you're going to be
forced into a position

394
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,170
where you have to start guessing.

395
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,590
That means you really don't
have control of that situation.

396
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,550
And the last thing you want to do is have

397
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,110
your leadership believe
you're not in control.

398
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,679
So being confident about
things you're doing,

399
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,440
making decisions with imperfect data,

400
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,780
knowing that they'll be
scrutinized for months later,

401
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,330
but that's where the planning comes in,

402
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,149
and this is where strong
leadership comes up.

403
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,030
This is when it's time to
be a leader is during these.

404
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,310
I think this is where you can
see good versus not as good.

405
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,590
And when you look at how they react

406
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,480
to these early days in an incident,

407
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,410
and of course running legitimate attacks

408
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,520
against your infrastructure,
simulate those attack

409
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,639
see what they do.

410
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,980
Give people the ability to react.

411
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,480
We used to do unscheduled,
clear back at Visa

412
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,670
which is a very long time ago,

413
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,350
we would do unscheduled
ping tests to make sure

414
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,820
that our incident response
team would pick them

415
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,320
up and react accordingly
and react properly.

416
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,280
So this is what it means to
do things before the attack.

417
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,500
We talked earlier about desktop exercises.

418
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,920
Make those desktop exercise
as realistic as possible.

419
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,750
Ask each step of the way

420
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,280
what each member of
this is going to do now.

421
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,649
That's really important because

422
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,910
then they'll actually be alert,

423
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,930
versus everyone else will see
who is taking that action.

424
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,470
Then when it comes down to the real thing,

425
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,636
I think you're more prepared,

426
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:52,470
you know communicating up
with your leadership team

427
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,010
during this process is
gonna be extremely important

428
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,650
as you go through this process.

429
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,280
- Yeah, and the other item here,

430
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,879
the other watch point
here is as you're digging

431
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,490
into an incident and
investigating, it's likely

432
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,490
that there are going to be
other things that are uncovered

433
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,290
in the course of that investigation.

434
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,290
So being clear as to whether
or not they're material

435
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,980
or relevant to the issue or
not keeps the team focused.

436
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,450
So, you know, utilizing a
parking lot, that's interesting.

437
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,270
You found something, it
doesn't appear to be related.

438
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,250
We're going to put that
in the parking lot.

439
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,070
We'll revisit it after we

440
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,750
get out of this particular incident.

441
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,093
Let the data lead you where,

442
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,963
be data led through the process.

443
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:53,010
- Absolutely, and what's the worst thing

444
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,040
is when you find evidence
of possibly another attack

445
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,210
that may have occurred before.

446
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,620
I one time in the middle
of this found traces,

447
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,050
as we go out and hunt, and
it's always interesting

448
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,210
when you go hunting,
this is why I've always

449
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,180
been a big fan of breach hunting.

450
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,287
Have somebody wake up every day saying,

451
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,690
"We got, hacked today, I
just don't know where."

452
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,890
If they take that attitude,
they'll start seeing the crumbs,

453
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,480
and that's what happens during this.

454
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,350
When you know you've had an
attack and you're looking,

455
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,899
you're going to see things that you

456
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,170
maybe should have seen before,

457
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,580
but staying on point, staying focused,

458
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,629
keeping your team focused, and keeping

459
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,330
your management team
apprised of the status.

460
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,240
We'll talk a little bit more of that

461
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,590
as we go forward here, about managing up.

462
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,199
With this, I'm gonna turn back to Dave

463
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,753
for our third problem.

464
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,510
- Great, the third item
is running out of energy,

465
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,820
especially before the adversary.

466
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,773
Tired teams, tired
individuals make mistakes.

467
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,800
I've seen it in the past
where critical items

468
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,139
have been either modified or removed,

469
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,173
especially when you're talking
about date stamps on a file.

470
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:12,370
And so it's key, if you're not able to

471
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,612
very quickly get your
hands around the issue,

472
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:22,120
to start divvying up the team into shifts

473
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,419
and forcing people to
go home, get some rest,

474
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,500
whether that's getting a nearby hotel

475
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,100
and making sure that people are fed,

476
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,709
people are rested

477
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,850
and they take the time that
they need for themselves.

478
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,320
Because in many scenarios,
when you start this,

479
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,102
you don't know if this is
gonna be hours, days or weeks.

480
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,733
- Yeah this is a sprint at first,

481
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,730
but it's really a marathon,
and a good leader,

482
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,390
again, we're gonna talk
about good leadership here,

483
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,560
understands from the beginning,

484
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,310
this may be a marathon
and getting people ready,

485
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,889
especially your, your key people.

486
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,620
They're gonna want to stay.

487
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,020
That's the thing to remember.

488
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,550
They're gonna say, "No, no, I'm fine.

489
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,383
No, I'm good."

490
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:09,860
They're running on adrenaline.

491
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,370
I mean, there's nothing
more intense than when

492
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,929
you're working in the middle
of one of these attacks

493
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,920
and trying to solve the problem,

494
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,747
but you as a leader gotta step up and say,

495
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,930
"No, I need you to unplug."

496
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,950
And we use the 16/15 rule,

497
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,080
which, you know gets six hours off.

498
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,210
And having that contract
with a nearby hotel

499
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,730
they could just go over.

500
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,520
I had the unpleasant experience of having

501
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,830
one of my staff injured on the way home

502
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,270
'cause they fell asleep.

503
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,560
So this is learned by experience

504
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,460
in making sure you've
absolutely stepped up

505
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,070
and insisted on this rest
'cause it is not a sprint,

506
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,260
it is a marathon.

507
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,353
It's gonna take longer
than you ever anticipated.

508
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,513
- Next one.

509
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,159
Yeah, lack of appreciation
for how difficult

510
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,693
it is to stop an ongoing
attack completely.

511
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,740
And this is further complicated by

512
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,530
digital transformation and the things that

513
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,930
we're going through,
that many organizations

514
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,883
are going through right now.

515
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:27,780
So, you know, if your organization
is doing a transformation

516
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,280
to the cloud and that
has been fairly recent,

517
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,889
making sure that your
incident response team

518
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,940
is aware and understands

519
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,660
those cloud environments

520
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,300
and what it means to their processes.

521
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,723
'Cause not all processes
will remain the same.

522
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,863
For instance, forensics.

523
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,940
You know, how you do
forensics on an on-prem server

524
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,300
is very different than what you do

525
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,223
for a cloud service or
on IaaS in AWS or Azure.

526
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,679
And making sure that your
incident response team

527
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,680
understands that, has written
that into their playbooks,

528
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,530
knows who to contact
because the contact list

529
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,043
is gonna change and the
expertise is gonna change.

530
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,590
- So as you're thinking
about this, you know,

531
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,209
an early adopter of the cloud,

532
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,930
Dave, a colleague of both of ours,

533
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,810
they had not yet moved their forensic team

534
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,800
to the cloud or forensics capabilities.

535
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,669
So they had to spin down a server down

536
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,460
to the local environment
to do that forensic, Dave.

537
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,720
It took 48 hours.

538
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,200
Do you know how much damage
can be done in 48 hours?

539
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,490
So we have to think about localization,

540
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,430
making sure you've got
virtual environments,

541
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,255
you've got them spread
throughout the world

542
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,990
so you can quickly get
that data over there

543
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,420
that you need to run for
your analysis in doing this.

544
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,253
- Correct.

545
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,250
- Anything further on this one, Dave?

546
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,680
Or I'll go to the next.

547
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,833
- No, I think we can move on.

548
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,909
- All right, so problem five,

549
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,640
and you know, I titled it "Managing up,"

550
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,147
but it's really being able
to keep your executive team

551
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,960
and your leadership team engaged

552
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,150
and having them understand, you know,

553
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,710
what's going on and giving
them information they need.

554
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,990
In the first hours you're
gonna get a hundred phone calls

555
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,250
from every person with a
letter before their VP.

556
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,310
So your executive VP's, your senior VP's,

557
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,649
your management leadership team.

558
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,000
I've even had calls from
the Chairman of the Board

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,510
wanting briefs.

560
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,893
This is a difficult problem to manage

561
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:50,883
because these are your executives.

562
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,679
So if you think about
this, one of the things

563
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,290
in the early days of an
attack, you're gonna be talking

564
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,360
to the CEO and your management team

565
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,870
and it's going to be a flow of bad news.

566
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,229
You're telling them things
that you're finding.

567
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,750
You'll be increasing these things

568
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,880
as you find out how wide it has spread.

569
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,620
So, you know, first, you know, good news

570
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,379
it could be 80% of the effort.

571
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,120
So preparing them for this

572
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,139
and the real education.

573
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,350
This is the reality, folks.

574
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,669
You're doing a breach analysis.

575
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,850
You're going to be
delivering a lot of bad news.

576
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,330
You don't want the bad news to seem like

577
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,949
that is you, of course.

578
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,640
So preparing your
management team up quick,

579
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,870
letting them understand
what to expect, and

580
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,020
that there will be bad news,
and we will have to gather more

581
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,680
and more information, and
we will keep you informed

582
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,550
and set up regular briefing moments.

583
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,570
Again, remember that imperfect
data I talked about earlier?

584
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,780
You're gonna have
important information to go

585
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,720
into these briefings, but
you, you're the leader.

586
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,400
You're the one they're depending on,

587
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,290
so you have to have
confidence in where you're at.

588
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,347
And even though you
don't have perfect data,

589
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:03,280
you can tell them what you do have,

590
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,370
what you do know and what you're doing.

591
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,786
You have to have that confidence

592
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,337
that you have it under control.

593
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,200
- Yeah, and the other point
that I would add here is

594
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,220
and I've been through this
scenario where, you know

595
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,940
the first 48 hours of an incident

596
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,635
we didn't have a lot of news.

597
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:28,350
And this happened to be a scenario where

598
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,370
it was an external report

599
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,409
that said that the organization
may have a problem.

600
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,410
And we were meeting with the
executive team every few hours.

601
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,970
And as I got into the second day,

602
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,370
they were becoming frustrated

603
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,689
by the fact that I didn't have any news.

604
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,980
And I said, "Well, actually no news

605
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,160
at this point is good news.

606
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,827
Because if I, if I come into
this room now with news,

607
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,240
it's only going to be bad."

608
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,130
Now, luckily that ended up positive.

609
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,450
There was no incident
for the organization,

610
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,450
which led to why I was
coming forward with no news,

611
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,970
but I think preparing the
executive team to understand

612
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,440
like you said, if I have
news that in the early stages

613
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,490
it's likely to be bad
and to interpret news

614
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,100
as good news, not lack of effort

615
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,040
or what they're used to is:

616
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm gonna lean in hard
so I can get answers.

617
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,053
Those first 48 hours,
no news is good news.

618
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,810
- Yeah, and again I want to really stress

619
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,690
working with your legal team,

620
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,160
keeping them in the loop,
getting their advice

621
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,560
because you might be talking
about contractual obligations

622
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,700
for notification.

623
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,731
You might have regulatory requirements

624
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,100
and keeping that balance there
with them so that they know.

625
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,939
And I think Dave mentioned earlier

626
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,460
and it was really important,

627
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,600
You got to keep that
community small because,

628
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,526
you know, as you mentioned,
it can be deposed.

629
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:10,940
"When did you know what?"

630
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,766
And you're dealing with
imperfect information

631
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:16,650
and so will they, so keeping
this information tightly locked

632
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,210
down while you figure it out.

633
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,930
Of course, facts are facts later in court.

634
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,630
You can never deny that,

635
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,800
but it's opinions that
will kill you later.

636
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,456
So keeping those opinions
out of what's going on

637
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,430
is absolutely essential.

638
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,130
And that's where
attorney-client can help you

639
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,460
in these scenarios.

640
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,760
So always make sure you
get that set up early.

641
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,760
With that I'm going to take

642
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,660
and just kinda talk about, you know, some

643
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,400
of the things that we've
stressed here today,

644
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,733
and, you know really thinking about

645
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:51,659
that security threats are
really business risks.

646
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,300
That's where it came through that balance.

647
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,159
Remember when we talked about ransomware

648
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,277
and that balance between,

649
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:00,920
"There's no way I want to
let them get away with this

650
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,240
but yet we have a business need,"

651
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,340
and letting those outweigh.

652
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,280
Knowing your vulnerabilities
and what they can mean

653
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,777
and identifying and manage
the risks with these things.

654
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,990
Also knowing where your data is,

655
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,150
it's always in fundamental
security of knowing

656
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,510
where your data is and what is
critical to the information.

657
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,540
And be able to adapt
quickly to these threats.

658
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,840
I mean, there's nothing more dynamic,

659
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,149
and you have to be agile
in the middle of an attack.

660
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,160
You're gonna see things
you've never seen before

661
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,717
and the way they're going to come at you,

662
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,330
you didn't practice.

663
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,530
If you have a well-trained
incident response team

664
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,540
and talented people, you will adapt.

665
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,980
That top-down culture, you know,

666
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,000
committing of the top
executives to the process

667
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,100
and be able to cascade to employees

668
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,770
and the third parties with
what it is you're doing,

669
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,360
what you're working on
because every business now

670
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,330
is interconnected with partners,
customers, and suppliers.

671
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,783
So it can have a broad impact.

672
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:03,874
Dave?

673
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,070
- Totally agree.

674
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,693
- Okay, so, you know, as we
think about closing here today,

675
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:16,149
I want to talk about some
of the real action things

676
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,770
are gonna go wrong,
even with the best plan.

677
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,780
I think it was the ultimate
philosopher Mike Tyson

678
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,700
once said, "All good
plans go out the window

679
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,660
the first time you get hit in the face."

680
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,800
And that's what happens here.

681
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,850
You're gonna have great plans,

682
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,919
but you're not gonna be ready for it.

683
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,090
But knowing what is
normal in your environment

684
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,550
so you can see abnormal, being
ready for these instances,

685
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,710
doing good desktop planning,
having that relationship

686
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,820
with your executive team,
your incident response team,

687
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,720
keeping those things active and go.

688
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,160
You know, burning out your staff,

689
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,820
they can make bad decisions and they can

690
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,980
actually destroy evidence
or even maybe prevent

691
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,620
you from acting quickly.

692
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,909
So keeping them fresh, keeping them rested

693
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,040
because this is not a sprint,
it's gonna be a marathon.

694
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,429
And then learning from
in the post, the things

695
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,489
that went right, the things
that didn't go as well

696
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,100
and doing that post-mortem

697
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,299
and that's always a
weird word, post-mortem.

698
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,710
But taking that and saying,
"Hey, here's what we learned.

699
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,679
We learned that we need to
train some people up on this.

700
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,889
So we need to shift more focus to that."

701
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,623
Always make that a
continuous learning process.

702
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,870
Dave, anything you want to add there

703
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,453
to the closing and give
us your last thoughts

704
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:35,973
at what was the most important
things you heard today?

705
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,540
- Yeah, I think it's the planning,

706
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,380
both vertical and horizontal.

707
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,510
So making sure that your executive team

708
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,510
is read into and expects the response by

709
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,069
the security team for incident response,

710
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,100
making sure that stakeholders

711
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,890
throughout the business
understand when they

712
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,870
will potentially be part
of the process and when

713
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,410
they won't be part of the process
and they won't understand.

714
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,940
And that includes maybe some

715
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,280
very influential leaders, right?

716
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,537
Your CFO or others that
aren't used to being told,

717
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,899
"I'm sorry, but it's
not appropriate to share

718
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,367
that information with you."

719
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,930
And making sure that the team
that you lead understands,

720
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,950
they understand what's expected of 'em

721
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,770
in the midst of crisis, they understand

722
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,960
the overall process,
so they understand why

723
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,850
you as the leader may be making

724
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,083
those decisions in the moment.

725
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,363
That's all key.

726
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:50,400
- Yeah. I mean the worst
case is when you're involved

727
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,760
in an investigation and
you can't tell your boss

728
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,420
about it and you have to
keep him or her in the dark.

729
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,880
That makes it really tough,
but that's part of the role,

730
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,900
and it's part of our agreement
to keep things confidential

731
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,360
and so it's tied.

732
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,070
So with that, you know,

733
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,470
how are we gonna apply what we learned?

734
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,120
You know, within the first
three months from now,

735
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,319
I mean in the next 90 days,

736
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,520
you should be reviewing
your incident response plan

737
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,080
with scenarios from this presentation.

738
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,180
Hopefully they were helpful to
you along with our comments.

739
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,690
Update your contact list,
make sure that's kept,

740
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,620
and that list is agile.

741
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,900
Adjust with the changes in relationships.

742
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,830
Know that should include, by the way,

743
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,580
knowing which contracts you may have

744
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,926
that require notification,
which regulatory bodies

745
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,093
and what that timeframe is gonna be.

746
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,710
And establish your plan to support

747
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,810
a breach investigation for a long term.

748
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,440
Remember those tips we talked about

749
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,870
and making sure you've got arrangements

750
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,450
with not only, "this is response teams,"

751
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,710
the local hotels, caterers
and people that can

752
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,913
help you through this process
to keep this organized.

753
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,460
So beyond the three months, you know,

754
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,350
get that specific training
that you say you've done

755
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,996
your gap analysis
between where I should be

756
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:07,940
and where I wanna be
and getting the training

757
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,080
for your staff, because these
things can be very costly,

758
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,870
as you've seen from the different studies.

759
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,290
Update your staff with
experts that can handle,

760
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,700
if you don't have the experts stay,

761
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,533
you're either gonna train them

762
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,750
or you're gonna update 'em,
especially in that post-mortem

763
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,330
you got to find out where
your weaknesses are,

764
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,200
like every good team.

765
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,850
And then having those business
response recovery teams

766
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,540
contracts in place.

767
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,500
They can assist you and give you that,

768
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,060
as Dave said, that burst capability

769
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,774
and having those things.

770
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:39,690
This is what we'd recommend like in,

771
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,750
within 90 days for sure.

772
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,100
And then of course, within
the first 180 days from now.

773
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,140
So we did put together a number
of resources are available

774
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,759
for you for future reading.

775
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,460
Greatness will be in the
hard copy should you need it.

776
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,089
So at this time, you
know, we'd like to ask

777
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,050
if you have any questions,
hopefully you've put them

778
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,920
in chat already and
you are ready to go and

779
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,170
we'll be happy to address those questions.

780
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,720
Dave, anything last minute you wanna

781
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,410
talk to the folks about?

782
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,970
- No, thanks for attending.

783
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,649
Hopefully you found value

784
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,803
and we're here to answer questions.

785
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,713
- That's great.

786
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,010
And I gotta tell you, Dave,
thank you and the audience.

787
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,210
It was as always fun talking with you,

788
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,193
and I hope this was a great event today.
