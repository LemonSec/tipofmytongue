00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,133
- Hi,

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,727
and thank you for joining
us for our session,

3
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:05,087
"Compliance Made Easy-

4
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,350
"Simplifying Your Approach to Privacy."

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,670
My name is Kelly Hood.

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer
with Optics Cyber Solutions.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,649
- And I'm Mike Green,

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,210
I'm also a Cybersecurity
Engineer with Optics Solutions.

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,470
Pleased be with you today.

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,630
Talk about privacy compliance.

11
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,189
- Great.

12
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,250
So today for our agenda,

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,083
we're going to be, yeah,

14
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:25,990
really talking about the approach

15
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,009
to simplifying your approach to privacy.

16
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,130
So to do that, we're going to be looking

17
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,670
how to bring requirements
together into one place,

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,500
to be able to streamline our approach.

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,333
And to do this,

20
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,949
we're going to use the privacy
framework that NIST put out.

21
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,620
So we'll provide an overview of that.

22
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,360
And then we'll create
a profile to document,

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,470
you know, what you're doing today,

24
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,710
and think it will help you figure out

25
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,710
what you can do tomorrow.

26
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,180
All in all coming together

27
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,019
to streamline improvement
activities moving forward,

28
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,043
to help simplify your approach.

29
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,669
So there are many similar
privacy requirements and controls

30
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,380
that we're seeing coming out from...

31
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,930
Many of the states across the US

32
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,290
are putting out different requirements,

33
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,670
such as CCPA that came
out a few years ago.

34
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,180
ISO also has requirements
covering cybersecurity

35
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,710
and privacy.

36
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,839
NIST has, you know, control frameworks,

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,360
and cybersecurity and privacy frameworks.

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
But one thing we see across

39
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,720
all of these different
standards and best practices

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,759
is there are a lot of commonalities.

41
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,130
Obviously there are
nuances between all of them

42
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,009
having slightly different focuses,

43
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,990
but here, for example,

44
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,990
we pulled out a few examples of,

45
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,190
specifically related to data inventory,

46
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,710
or understanding what you have.

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,850
So we can see from CCPA

48
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,860
that we're looking at the
sensitive, personal information,

49
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,030
understanding what we have,
what the sensitivity of it is.

50
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,030
ISO 27001 has requirements
for inventorying

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,350
your systems and data.

52
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,140
A153 has, you know,

53
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,710
requirements around inventorying,

54
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,509
and so does the cybersecurity framework.

55
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,990
But when we can look across
all of these different places

56
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,089
and see that there are
those commonalities,

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,209
it allows us to be able to bring
that together in one place.

58
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,270
And what we're going to
talk about doing today,

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,230
is bringing it together in one place,

60
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,329
in the privacy framework.

61
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,280
So here we can see one
of the subcategories

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,100
from the privacy framework

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,450
is focused on that systems, products,

64
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,420
and services being inventoried.

65
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,929
And so we'll talk about all
of these different things

66
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,080
and how to bring them together.

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,970
And as we do that,

68
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,730
we wanted to provide a quick overview

69
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,833
of the privacy framework itself.

70
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,970
So the privacy framework was published

71
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,310
or put out last year in January of 2020.

72
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,170
It does have three components,

73
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,660
the core, the profiles and the tiers.

74
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,760
And if you are familiar

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,149
with the cybersecurity framework,

76
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,793
this may look familiar, 'cause
it is set up in the same way.

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,710
So the core really,

78
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,980
is where we get those key pieces of

79
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,760
what should a privacy program include.

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,299
What are those things we need to be doing?

81
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,220
What are those outcomes
that we need to meet?

82
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,957
And that's what we'll be able to use

83
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:14,720
to look across industry,

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
and look at the different
standards and frameworks,

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,197
and say, "Where do these
things align and map?"

86
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,300
So the privacy framework, the core itself,

87
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,550
has five functions that we
can see here on the screen,

88
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,370
identify, govern, control,
communicate, and protect.

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,170
And these are all creating a hierarchy.

90
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,820
And this is the highest
level of the hierarchy

91
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,510
that helps us to understand,

92
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,519
what are those things we need to be doing?

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,140
To it, within our privacy programs.

94
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,820
And as we break that down

95
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,190
and the hierarchy, it goes from

96
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,430
the functions at the highest level,

97
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,100
to the categories, and then ultimately

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,940
to sub categories at the lowest level.

99
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,960
And so here,

100
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,860
we'll be able to look across and see,

101
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,930
what do we need to be identifying?

102
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,270
And here's back to that
example we were looking at

103
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,990
with inventorying and mapping,

104
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,500
and understanding, you know,

105
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,920
what are the systems that we have?

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,910
What are the data that we're processing?

107
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,270
What is that sensitivity,

108
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,579
and what do we need to be doing with that?

109
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,663
As we walk through these different areas.

110
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,610
The second component of
the privacy framework

111
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,240
is the implementation tiers.

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,000
And the implementation
tiers are really here

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,230
to help us understand how
sufficient we need to,

114
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,010
or how sufficient these
capabilities need to be,

115
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,740
and how kind of mature we need to be

116
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,770
in these different areas.

117
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,740
So they vary from level, or the tier one,

118
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,680
from adding a partial program,

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,860
to two, being risk informed,

120
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,560
three, being repeatable,
and four, being adaptive.

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,360
So it's often thought
of as a maturity model,

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,610
but it is a little bit different,

123
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,988
in that the tiers are not discreet.

124
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:59,250
And you don't also need to
get to be that highest level.

125
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,260
Where in a maturity model,

126
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,400
oftentimes you are trying to
be the most mature you can be.

127
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,799
But here it's okay to not
be a level or a tier four,

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,790
if you want to only be a, you know,

129
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,140
a tier two or a three,

130
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,979
where you know that you have

131
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,180
a risk informed and repeatable process.

132
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,000
That might be enough
for your organization.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,300
But having this conversation
around the tiers

134
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,840
can really help us understand
and communicate well

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,530
across your organization and others,

136
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,349
to make sure that
everybody's on the same page

137
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,000
with where you're striving to be.

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,760
The tiers also have characteristics

139
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,680
within each of them,

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,930
broken down across risk
management processes,

141
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,550
the integration of your
risk management program,

142
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,940
ecosystem relationships,

143
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,070
and workforce as well.

144
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,903
To help you really,

145
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,440
as you're looking at what
tier you want to be to be,

146
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,450
to figure out how you would
actually implement that,

147
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,613
and what that means in your context.

148
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,753
Okay?

149
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:52,880
And then the third component here

150
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
is the privacy framework profiles.

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,930
And this is where we're
going to be spending

152
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,690
a lot of time today.

153
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
In our example scenario,

154
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,650
as we look at, how do we
actually build a profile,

155
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,520
and a profile is really
a place to just document,

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
what are we doing today?

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,930
Where do we want to go?

158
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,090
Basically bringing together the core

159
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,969
and the tiers, and defining
that in a central place.

160
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,290
So we can look at bringing
together our requirements

161
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,520
from you know, maybe our
regulatory requirements,

162
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,900
our business requirements,

163
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,760
and having all of this
information in one place.

164
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,500
And then using the tiers to say, you know,

165
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,350
how mature do we want to be?

166
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,490
How sufficient,

167
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,190
or do we want these capabilities to be,

168
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,219
for each of these, for
each of the sub categories,

169
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,823
from the core of the privacy framework.

170
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,789
Additionally, I just
wanted to point out that

171
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,370
the the core has, you
know, all of the, you know,

172
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,540
about a hundred sub categories,

173
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,700
but you you don't necessarily
have to do them all.

174
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
There's no requirement.

175
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,610
I mean, this is a framework

176
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,930
that was created to help create the bounds

177
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,790
and kind of the structure

178
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,810
for what a privacy program should be.

179
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,660
And it really creates that nice structure

180
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,406
as we start bringing together
those legal and regulatory

181
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:03,240
compliance requirements into one place.

182
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,480
But if you wanted to just
focus on a subset of them,

183
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,270
there's no requirement to use them all.

184
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,340
Here on this screen,

185
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,739
we can see an example where, you know,

186
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,440
you can see the core

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,810
has all five functions listed out.

188
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,100
Our current profile,

189
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,237
if we're looking at what
we're only doing today,

190
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,010
this example has, we only have things

191
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,090
across identify, govern, and protect,

192
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,001
but we haven't started

193
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:26,510
implementing anything in
control and communicate.

194
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,901
But knowing that we want
to get there eventually,

195
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,660
that's our target.

196
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,640
And that we're going to be covering topics

197
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,030
from all five areas,

198
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,239
but still maybe not all
of the sub categories.

199
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,573
But that's a conversation you can have

200
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,770
internally within your organization,

201
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,289
based on your risks and your needs.

202
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,460
So finally, before we
get into our scenario,

203
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,780
we want to talk a little bit about

204
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,320
cybersecurity risk and privacy risk.

205
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,849
Knowing that there is an overlap,

206
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,340
and oftentimes it can cause
a bit of confusion between,

207
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,650
you know, what is the difference,

208
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,979
how much of an overlap is there?

209
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,430
So we wanted to pause for just a moment

210
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,240
to talk about it for, talk
about it a little bit.

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,550
But cybersecurity risk
is typically focused on,

212
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,270
or associated with the
loss of confidentiality,

213
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,200
integrity or availability.

214
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,330
Where privacy risk

215
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,455
is really focused on the unintended

216
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:14,490
consequences of data processing.

217
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,870
So that could reach in, or
result in a privacy breach,

218
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,110
you know, or a lack of confidentiality,

219
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,620
some sort of disclosure.

220
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,529
But it's not often related
to the availability concerns

221
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,883
that would be more closely
related to cybersecurity.

222
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,450
So we wanted to just kind of highlight

223
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,990
as we're moving into this scenario,

224
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,470
and talking about the privacy framework,

225
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,590
and the privacy risks
that we're considering,

226
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,419
whether they're business related,

227
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,069
or coming as a result of
a regulatory requirement.

228
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,660
That's what we really want to focus on,

229
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,089
is those unintended
consequences of data processing.

230
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,890
And some of the key
terms that we'll be using

231
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,330
that show up in the framework

232
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,000
in a lot of these requirements,

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,900
are included over here on the right side.

234
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,199
With data being a
representation of information

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,910
that we're all familiar with.

236
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,800
But a data action

237
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,280
is a term that's used a
little bit less common,

238
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,380
or less frequently.

239
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,960
Where a data action is really,

240
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,380
all those things we're doing with data.

241
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,213
So that could be,

242
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:14,219
collection retention,
logging, disclosure, sharing.

243
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,440
It's what are we doing with that data?

244
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,650
And then data processing,

245
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,920
is really a collection of data actions.

246
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
So it covers the whole life cycle of data.

247
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,520
That could be all of those same things,

248
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,870
but looking at, you know,

249
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,460
what's being done with
that data over time.

250
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,300
And then privacy risk is really what

251
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,270
we're going to be looking
to mitigate, or reduce,

252
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,390
as we are looking at
the privacy capabilities

253
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,403
to put in place.

254
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,610
Then we want to make sure

255
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,410
that we're reducing the likelihood

256
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,130
that individuals will
experience any problems

257
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,363
with, due to, you know, data processing.

258
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,710
So now as we jump into
the example scenario,

259
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,120
I'll hand it over to Mike,

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,973
and he'll walk us through how
we're going to get started.

261
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,370
- Sure. Thanks, Kelly.

262
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,290
Yeah, I think that last
slide there with the,

263
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,439
the Venn diagram between

264
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,920
the privacy and security, (clears throat)

265
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,170
is really salient here.

266
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,530
We'll kind of walk through,

267
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,640
but it kind of forms the basis

268
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,210
for sort of the discussion here.

269
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,440
We kind of leverage those
cybersecurity frameworks,

270
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,830
regulate you know,
regulations, control, catalogs,

271
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,677
et cetera to kind of walk through

272
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:17,050
the examples scenario that
we have laid out here.

273
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,709
And just as a reminder, as
we kind of pointed to you,

274
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,930
upfront, with the, you know,
we have different regulations,

275
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,530
so here we actually pulled in CCPA,

276
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,829
you'll notice from ISO and NIST as well.

277
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,830
For this scenario we're
going to walk through more

278
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,660
from a inventory perspective.

279
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,870
So from a data inventory,
system inventory,

280
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,700
and you'll notice the
CCPA, as an example here,

281
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,756
just talks about sensitive,
personal information.

282
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,069
It doesn't explicitly mention systems,

283
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,740
but obviously you'll
kind of need the systems

284
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,080
to understand how the
processing kind of goes through.

285
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,913
So that's really,

286
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,770
we're going to go through
here for this example,

287
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,620
to kind of walk through

288
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,150
how you can use different
frameworks, different alignments,

289
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,209
to kind of interpret and understand

290
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,510
some of these more higher
level legal requirements

291
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,980
that different acts and laws

292
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,954
kind of brings from a privacy realm,

293
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,183
kind of align that to
the privacy framework.

294
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,589
And again, here, so you see the ID.IM-P,

295
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,423
so really,

296
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,190
we're focused on the identify function

297
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,860
for the cybersecurity,
for the privacy framework.

298
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,440
And so here you see an example crosswalk,

299
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,240
really across the different regulations.

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,700
You'll notice most of them here

301
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,640
from a cybersecurity
perspective, control catalogs,

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,069
different frameworks, and
we have CCPA there as well.

303
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,680
So on the left, the really,
as Kelly mentioned earlier,

304
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,020
the subcategories of
the identify function.

305
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,100
And you'll see here,
they're broken down into

306
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,230
specific statements or practices,

307
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,200
for really what you're trying to achieve

308
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,853
for this specific sub category.

309
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,120
Next here, as I mentioned,

310
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
you have the different regulations

311
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,590
sort of aligned in a crosswalk fashion.

312
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:00,933
And really here,

313
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,680
you know, there may be overlap there.

314
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,739
There's not usually a one for one mapping,

315
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,330
but you can kind of understand the intent

316
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,550
of a privacy regulation.

317
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,402
And kinda use this as
a basis going forward,

318
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,240
to kind of understand where to start,

319
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,320
when you're starting to document

320
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,923
your privacy program.

321
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,003
And then the last two columns here,

322
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,270
(clears throat)

323
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,420
are really the notes and gaps.

324
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,890
So really what you're doing here is

325
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,552
you're understanding from
inventory perspective,

326
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,360
really, what you're doing today,

327
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,470
document any notes, any gaps.

328
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,303
(clears throat)

329
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,150
It's essentially your
current understanding

330
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,670
of where you are from
a privacy perspective.

331
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,530
So you kinda understand
where you want to go,

332
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,990
how, I guess, as far as the tier,

333
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,970
where you want to be as far as the tier,

334
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,083
kind of meeting some
of these requirements.

335
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,900
So like I mentioned here,

336
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,040
we want to do is kind of walk through

337
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,983
each of these.

338
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,700
To kind of give a high
level, high level overview

339
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,581
and sort of some examples

340
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,740
of what this kind of looks like

341
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,340
in practice as you walk through.

342
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,113
- Right.

343
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:06,950
And so this will be an example

344
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,930
of a profile that we had mentioned before

345
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,199
on one of those core
components of the framework.

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,460
That a profile can take
a lot of different forms.

347
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,790
We've seen people use it,

348
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,079
spreadsheets is what we
typically like to use.

349
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,210
We find it's an easy way
to track the information.

350
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,630
And it's like Mike had mentioned,

351
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,660
being able to map the the subcategories

352
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,290
to the other regulations or frameworks,

353
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,160
and then include notes and gaps.

354
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,270
But we've also seen people use profiles

355
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,110
or create profiles that
are pictures and graphics,

356
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,980
and, or, pie charts,

357
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,280
or all kinds of different things.

358
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,620
So there's not any one way,

359
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,040
that is the, you know, a
right way to create a profile.

360
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,910
But we just, this is an
example that we like,

361
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,810
and we wanted to walk
through that with you,

362
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,819
and hope that it helps
to see how you can really

363
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,670
pull everything together and
capture it all in one place.

364
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,820
- So with respect to the overall,

365
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,410
so the process we're going
to walk through here,

366
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,711
so you kind of see on this sheet here,

367
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,040
we kind of have the gaps, notes
and gaps kind of filled in.

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,510
We'll walk through each
one of these in depth.

369
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,700
But again, just sort of
an overall perspective,

370
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,670
this is what we've seen kind
of work well for organizations.

371
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,400
You have a one place where you
can kind of map everything.

372
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
And specifically,

373
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,203
if you're an organization that's using

374
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:15,550
a cybersecurity framework or ISO,

375
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,410
you may have some of
this information already.

376
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,969
Typically the privacy may
be driven from compliance,

377
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,730
maybe, or the privacy organization within

378
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,400
a specific organization or a group.

379
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,860
But you may have inputs

380
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,990
from other parts of the business,

381
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,910
that's IT, or compliance,
or the cybersecurity

382
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,410
within the organization.

383
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,449
So really here,

384
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,960
I think this alignment kind of helps,

385
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,910
kind of form that
baseline, as I mentioned,

386
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,800
for organizations that sort of
have that framework in place.

387
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,789
And it's really it's here,

388
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,370
it's just a translation into,

389
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,387
it wasn't made from a privacy perspective.

390
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,250
(mumbles) most of the way there,

391
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,526
and they really what those
gaps kind of look like.

392
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,540
(clears throat)

393
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,202
For the first example here,

394
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,083
(clears throat)

395
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:58,915
the ID.IM-P1,

396
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,840
it's really talking about
systems, products, services,

397
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,290
that process data, you know,

398
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,079
that process data are inventoried.

399
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,550
And really, when we're looking at here,

400
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,740
is really kind of understanding

401
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,650
what the inventory of data is.

402
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,540
And you'll see here in the notes

403
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,310
for this specific organization,

404
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,280
it looks like they have a subset

405
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,990
of critical business systems are included

406
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,550
in their configuration
management database.

407
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,000
But it looks like the
inventory doesn't account

408
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,870
for all of those critical systems.

409
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,520
And that's really what
we see in organizations.

410
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,870
You kind of want to start somewhere.

411
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,010
So if you understand
that you have a subset

412
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,640
of your critical businesses,
business processes,

413
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
or business systems sort of inventory,

414
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,250
that's a good place to start.

415
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,740
And kinda in understanding that gap.

416
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,190
And even as a first step,

417
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,750
that may be aligning to

418
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,810
what the critical business processes are

419
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,760
from you know, the business perspective.

420
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,490
So at this point you may not want

421
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,800
to get a full inventory
of all your systems.

422
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,020
Maybe it is just focusing on
the critical business systems.

423
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,370
And again, here you're
really just documenting

424
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,400
what the current state is

425
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,850
so you can understand where
you need to go from there.

426
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,440
If it is talking to other
parts of the business,

427
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,390
other parts of the
organization, but really here,

428
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,400
you're just kind of
understanding where you are.

429
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,650
So you kinda know where you need to go

430
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,731
with respect to building out

431
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,220
this profile that we have here.

432
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,053
- Right.

433
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:15,886
And like Mike was saying that this is,

434
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:19,050
obviously this is not a full list

435
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,870
of all of those critical business systems,

436
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,880
what's being done,

437
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,950
what type of database this is,

438
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,910
what's all being tracked there.

439
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,180
But one thing we like about this approach

440
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,170
for capturing it and kind of this form,

441
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,530
this type of profile, is
that I always think of it

442
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,069
like as an elevator speech.

443
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,517
If somebody came to you and said,

444
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:38,230
"So what are you doing to, you
know, with your inventories?"

445
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,097
And you can say, "Well,
we've got our critical,

446
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,656
"our critical systems are
included in the CMDB."

447
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:43,490
And you know, it's,

448
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,400
and you can kind of characterize it,

449
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,010
what it is that you're doing,

450
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,129
without having to stop and figure out,

451
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,480
where is the database, who controls it,

452
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,110
what all is included.

453
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,240
'Cause sometimes it's so easy

454
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,020
to get kind of bogged down in the details.

455
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,720
And knowing the details
are obviously important

456
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,030
especially when there's
regulatory concerns.

457
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,857
But as a step one for
somebody just getting started,

458
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,675
sometimes it's easier to just kind of

459
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,319
sit down with a sheet of paper,

460
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,569
write down what you know,
and get something there.

461
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,679
Because it's obvious or so commonly,

462
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,319
it's that starting with
a blank sheet of paper

463
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,599
that's the hardest part.

464
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,389
And once you've got
something written down,

465
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,880
like Mike had said, you can go talk

466
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,190
to the other people in
your organization and say,

467
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,410
you know, what on here is right,

468
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,430
what on here is wrong,

469
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,560
what don't I know?

470
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,446
And kind of get their input as well.

471
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,449
Okay.

472
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,730
So as we walk through
these, so the next one here,

473
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,800
we wanted to talk through ID.IM-P2.

474
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,340
So this is kind of building on ID.IM-P1.

475
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,030
Where owners and operators

476
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,120
and their roles with
respect to the systems,

477
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,949
product service and components,

478
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,120
are also included in the inventory.

479
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,409
So like Mike had said, we had,

480
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,560
in that first subcategory,

481
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,149
we know that we have a subset
of the critical systems

482
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,690
that are included in the CMDB.

483
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,390
But here we're asking, okay,

484
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,900
so now we know what we have,

485
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,130
or some of what we have,

486
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,130
but who are the people responsible

487
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,140
for those systems, for that data?

488
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,100
So looking at who are
the people responsible,

489
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,709
for our example scenario,

490
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,410
and for a lot of businesses that we see.

491
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,400
Oftentimes we know who the
business system owner is,

492
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,710
or the technical system owner is.

493
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,890
But honestly are a lot of times

494
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,040
the roles and responsibilities
of those people

495
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,550
are not often defined.

496
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,730
And so that's what we wanted to,

497
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,690
we captured here, in this example is that

498
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,650
we know at a really high level

499
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,070
who's responsible for
this business system.

500
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,489
But whether or not,

501
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,290
we haven't actually
documented what their roles

502
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,470
and responsibilities are.

503
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,280
So there's a lot of things you can assume

504
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,040
as being the person responsible.

505
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,030
You're the business system owner,

506
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,660
but a lot of times
having that written down

507
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,100
can go a long way to just making sure

508
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,040
everybody has the right communication

509
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,190
to know what expectations are,

510
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,440
so that we're not missing anything.

511
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,120
Also the BSO and the TSO,

512
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,340
they may have different
levels of responsibilities,

513
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,740
or authorities, and then it
does vary across organizations.

514
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,110
So having that captured
for your organization,

515
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,409
and what is necessary for you

516
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,853
can be really helpful with making sure

517
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,900
that everybody's on the same
page with those expectations.

518
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,770
And can also be a really great opportunity

519
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,350
to go back and talk to the
different business owners

520
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,521
and system owners

521
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,629
to say, "What do you think
your responsibilities are?"

522
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,700
'Cause here, just looking at like I said,

523
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,533
with this is, you know,

524
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,550
knowing this is the elevator speech of

525
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,940
maybe I'm the, you know,
privacy is, the person,

526
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,740
if I've been tagged with

527
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,400
figuring out what we're
doing with privacy,

528
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
with respect to my organization,

529
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,030
or a Chief Privacy Officer.

530
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,570
A lot of people are getting
new privacy requirement

531
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,020
or responsibilities added
to their roles right now,

532
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,500
that may not have previously
had those responsibilities.

533
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
But being able to step back and say,

534
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,490
what do I know, what don't I know?

535
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,870
And being able to document that,

536
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,870
and just get, like I said,

537
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,530
just get something on the paper for now,

538
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,593
and then be able to find
out those details as you go.

539
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:57,939
- That's really a key point here.

540
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,430
Is as you mentioned,

541
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,640
with the responsibilities,

542
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,670
and really who's responsible for what

543
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,640
from a business perspective.

544
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,290
A business owner may own the data,

545
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,280
but they may not understand the technical

546
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,210
interconnections with
different systems and things.

547
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,440
So in a lot of cases,

548
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,790
you may need to speak
to multiple individuals,

549
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,310
kind of understand the
roles, responsibilities,

550
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,050
to get a full picture of really
which systems or process,

551
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,030
and which data within the connections are.

552
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,889
And sort of what the
impact of that might be

553
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,033
as you kind of build out
your privacy program.

554
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,261
- Right.

555
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,370
And actually, in leveraging,

556
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,800
even looking back at those,

557
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,780
the columns in the middle,

558
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,444
where we're mapping back to CCPA

559
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:37,800
and cybersecurity framework
and all these things,

560
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,450
for anybody that maybe, yeah,

561
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,283
you know, might be

562
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:43,060
documenting this for the first time,

563
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,929
if you have already gone
through an exercise,

564
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,250
I think, yeah, Mike had mentioned earlier,

565
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,700
you can go take that information from,

566
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,150
if you've done a cybersecurity
framework profile,

567
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,490
for example, and see

568
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,856
what did you write for
ID.AM, you know, one and two,

569
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:59,279
or what did we say we
were doing for CPA, CCPA,

570
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,497
and be able to leverage that
information here as well.

571
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,520
- And so for the next one here, ID.IM-P3,

572
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,570
this is really looking at
categories of individuals.

573
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,403
Having examples here,

574
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,360
as you know, customers,
employees, consumers,

575
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,620
whose data's being processed or inventory.

576
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,479
So in this scenario,

577
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,850
this specific organization
doesn't have any specific inputs

578
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,669
or knowledge around, you
know, if that's being done.

579
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,750
And you see the gap here is really,

580
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,040
you need to evaluate categories
of data being processed

581
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,180
for the relevant subject types.

582
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,470
And, you know, that's, like I said,

583
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,410
what we're doing here is really just

584
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,660
documenting what the
individual, organization,

585
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,580
who was actually completing
this exercise knows at the time.

586
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,030
So it may be that the
organization does have it,

587
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,320
it's just not known by the specific group

588
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,560
who's kind of going through this exercise.

589
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,940
And that's totally fine,

590
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,000
but you're trying to understand what

591
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,531
the baseline of your privacy program

592
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:50,696
(clears throat) sorta looks like.

593
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:54,000
For some of these, for
this one in particular,

594
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,728
you may be able to infer the types of data

595
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,130
that a system process processes.

596
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,460
So if it's a human resources
system, for example,

597
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,850
I mean you can be pretty sure that

598
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,929
there will be employees' data
within that type of system.

599
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,270
So you could infer that,

600
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,060
but it may not be a full picture.

601
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,379
You could have contractors
or non-employees' data

602
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,120
that's also part of
that specific inventory

603
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,203
of data for that system.

604
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,766
Like I mentioned, I think the gap here

605
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,070
is really just to do that analysis,

606
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,023
what you understand.

607
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,850
Or when you say that there, you know,

608
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,240
you don't understand what the full scope

609
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,410
of documentation around
categories of individuals

610
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,010
where you do that analysis on,

611
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,470
system that you can reasonably infer,

612
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,500
and then kind of broaden
it out from there.

613
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,840
Again, probably focusing

614
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,850
on all the critical business systems

615
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,872
to really understand the
impact from that perspective.

616
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,320
- Right. That's a great point.

617
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,800
Sometimes I know it hurts to write none,

618
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,220
or that you're not doing anything,

619
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,370
but sometimes it could be
an impactful statement.

620
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,879
I mean, maybe it's something you've been,

621
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,150
you know you need to do,

622
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,580
or maybe you haven't realized

623
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,750
was something that needed to happen.

624
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,898
And it always, you know, it's,

625
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,976
sometimes it's always the,

626
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:03,950
you try to write something
up that you're doing

627
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,430
related to a subcategory or requirement,

628
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,650
which obviously gives you a great start,

629
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,200
if you are doing those things.

630
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,090
But by walking through the exercise

631
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,540
line by line like this, and kind of seeing

632
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,920
where those gaps are, it can
also be really informative.

633
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,070
To be able to say here are the real,

634
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,381
the things we need to start with,

635
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:23,210
or the things we don't
have anything we're doing.

636
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,122
And so it can be, as much as it

637
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,020
sometimes hurts to see the none,

638
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,650
or the, a blank cell,

639
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,150
sometimes that can be really impactful,

640
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,010
and really you can get
a lot of information

641
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,610
that way, or communicates a lot.

642
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,210
So the fourth sub category here,

643
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,830
data actions of the
systems product services

644
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,040
are inventoried,

645
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,610
it is focusing on what
are those data actions?

646
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,370
So when we were talking
about what are we logging,

647
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,419
what are we generating,
disclosing, sharing,

648
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,060
all the things we're doing with the data,

649
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,790
we want to document that as well.

650
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,330
In addition to the, you know,

651
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,210
the systems and the
data that we have, yeah.

652
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,377
What are we doing with the data?

653
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:07,770
So here and for this scenario,

654
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,680
our organization has the system functions,

655
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,540
and data processes are
documented for critical systems

656
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,840
in the systems requirements documents.

657
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,550
So this may have been done initially

658
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,810
for more of a functional purpose,

659
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,990
just wanting to know what
is it that our systems do?

660
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,560
What are we doing with
the data on our systems?

661
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,260
But it is just our critical systems.

662
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,410
And so we've got a note
over in the gap section,

663
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,810
that says the data
actions are not documented

664
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,750
for our legacy systems.

665
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,200
Which may be okay,

666
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,900
if we don't have a regulatory
requirement, or a real driver.

667
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,850
But in some heavily regulated industries,

668
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,514
or if we really know that we're processing

669
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,260
sensitive data or personal information

670
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,370
that we want to make sure
we are heavily controlling,

671
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,139
we may want to be able to go back

672
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,773
and look at those legacy systems.

673
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:57,330
Or look not only at our critical systems,

674
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,070
but any new system moving forward.

675
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,020
There can be a lot of opportunities there

676
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,410
by identifying what is
it that we know today,

677
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,000
and maybe a stepping stone to
getting everything documented

678
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,310
in all of those data actions inventory.

679
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,100
It's just that as we're
creating new systems,

680
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,110
or doing new things,

681
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,520
where we're documenting
and defining that as well,

682
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,900
and then we can address
the legacy systems in time.

683
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,250
But this is back to that.

684
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,510
You can take it back to
the tiers conversation,

685
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,500
as well as you don't
have to be a, you know,

686
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,630
an adaptive tier four
organization in every subcategory.

687
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,280
It may not be necessary always.

688
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,670
It really depends on your risk tolerance,

689
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,200
the risks to your business,
and those compliance drivers,

690
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,560
to know what is appropriate
for your organization.

691
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,429
So here is where you can start

692
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,400
to have that conversation
with yourself and say,

693
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
this is what I know I'm doing.

694
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,230
This is what I know I'm not doing.

695
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,020
And then we can look
at those gaps and say,

696
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,170
how do we prioritize?

697
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,070
Where do we need to start?

698
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,919
What do we want to do moving forward?

699
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,180
And at a later time.

700
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,700
But just knowing here, that for example,

701
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,880
that I know I've got my
critical systems documented,

702
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,870
because they were critical,

703
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,800
and I knew I needed to
have this information,

704
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,090
but the legacy systems we may
need to come back and revisit.

705
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,812
So just having that documented
can be really helpful.

706
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,233
- Yeah. I think that's true.

707
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,684
And in this case, it may even be,

708
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,350
as part of the action of,

709
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,179
we just use that same process that we use

710
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,500
to document critical systems,

711
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,810
and just apply that to all systems.

712
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,760
Or it may just be, you know,

713
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,780
for net new systems, we'll apply
the standard going forward.

714
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,100
And then there's a different process

715
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,570
to kind of handle those
legacy systems as well.

716
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,284
So again, as we kind of walk through this,

717
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,940
you can kind of see where there may be

718
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,840
things that aren't in place,

719
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,850
but you can leverage current
practices, current processes.

720
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,010
And at least be able to kind of, you know,

721
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,310
as you look at things,
prioritize what the focus may be.

722
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,860
If the legacy systems are legacy,

723
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,340
and they're being replaced by new systems,

724
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,129
it may not be as critical

725
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,580
to kind of walk through that exercise.

726
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,360
But kind of having things on paper

727
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,530
like Kelly mentioned that, you know,

728
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,470
having something on paper

729
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,730
where you can kind of evaluate,

730
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,550
take a look at, and baseline,

731
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,770
is really a good first step to kind of,

732
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,320
as you build out your
program and understanding,

733
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,230
or even augment and mature

734
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,890
your privacy program going forward.

735
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,370
Okay. So for this one, ID.IM-P5.

736
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,310
So the purposes of data
actions are inventory.

737
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,320
It looks like here for
our example organization,

738
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,270
their system requirements
mapped to the business process,

739
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,810
for the purpose of being, you know,

740
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,970
data being processed, where again,

741
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,010
it looks like here for the in,

742
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,077
the legacy system, that's not the case.

743
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,070
And it could just be a,

744
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,090
it could be like for several organizations

745
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,470
where you've gotten mature
processes over time,

746
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,210
and they just apply to new systems

747
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,043
as you kind of built out,

748
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:37,020
developed new systems going forward,

749
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,820
but you didn't do, you know,

750
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,730
go back and retroactively
apply that to legacy systems.

751
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,510
So like we mentioned, for
our previous subcategory,

752
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,050
it may just be that based on the process,

753
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,419
or the sort of the position
of the legacy systems,

754
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,500
where it may not make sense

755
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,894
to really document those actions.

756
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,580
If they're going to be
replaced in the near term,

757
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,530
certainly, from a compliance perspective,

758
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,320
it should be something that you focus on.

759
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,556
But if you have a roadmap of,

760
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,930
sort of how you're going to
handle this going forward

761
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,690
with the, you know, the
inventory or the data actions,

762
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,150
it's really something.

763
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,370
This document will be informative,

764
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,929
to kind of make those
decisions and understand.

765
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,210
We say legacy systems like

766
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,310
it's just one system or two systems,

767
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,280
where we talking about, you know,

768
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,620
a thousand systems,

769
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,520
will really be, you know

770
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,276
really drive that conversation.

771
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,700
You know, what the priorities will be

772
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,853
kind of going forward
to really meet these,

773
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,460
the intent of this specific practice.

774
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,950
And again, like we mentioned before,

775
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,424
if you went through this exercise,

776
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:32,450
and you kind of map to, you know,

777
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,200
say the cybersecurity framework or A153

778
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,470
or any of the ISO controls

779
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,620
you may have a lot of this information,

780
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,520
that doesn't necessarily
need to be redeveloped, or,

781
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,230
you know reanalyzed,

782
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,250
that decision may have been made already.

783
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,580
It may just be the fact
just kind of have to

784
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,919
input that here until you're just informed

785
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,720
across your privacy program as well.

786
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,590
- Yeah. ID.IM-P6, here is, yeah,

787
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,010
another example, but we're
not doing anything yet,

788
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,550
but data elements within the
data actions are inventoried.

789
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,120
And as much as it hurts, yeah,

790
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,177
sometimes the rate that
we're not doing anything,

791
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,629
soon as it's really impactful,

792
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,640
but here for this practice or
this subcategory specifically,

793
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,210
we know that we probably should be

794
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,940
recording those data elements.

795
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,900
You know, categories of
customer information,

796
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,010
so that we can handle things

797
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,360
like data subject access requests.

798
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,740
We need to know what are
those different categories

799
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,000
of data that we have,

800
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,920
with where's our employee data,

801
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,130
our you know, maybe our contractor data,

802
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,227
and if somebody sent a
request to say, "Hey,

803
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,710
"I want you to delete all my data."

804
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,480
Or "I want a copy of my data."

805
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,780
We need to have a way to be able

806
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,139
to provide those answers
and address those requests.

807
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,708
And so that's where this one is.

808
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,820
I think a lot of people will be finding

809
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,899
that this is a new thing that
will need to be addressed.

810
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,788
'Cause we're seeing

811
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,604
this as a little bit less commonly done

812
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:53,193
through other requirements previously.

813
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,560
- So for the next one here ID.IM-P7.

814
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,929
This was around the
processing environment,

815
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,232
as identified, and see examples here,

816
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,430
geographic location,

817
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,720
whether it's internal
cloud or third parties.

818
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,680
And for our example here,

819
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,510
we have data processing curves

820
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,360
both on premises and in the cloud.

821
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,409
And then it looks like the gap is,

822
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,070
it's unknown where the data is stored

823
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,240
in the cloud, where it
geographically located.

824
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,320
And also we have a note here

825
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,090
that the inventory process doesn't require

826
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,459
the environment to be recorded.

827
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,160
So I think that last
piece there is really key.

828
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,470
So it's not necessarily the efficiency,

829
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,567
it's just the business process of how

830
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,200
the specific organization sort of

831
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,137
inventories their system or their data.

832
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:41,870
There hasn't been a
requirement to kind of document

833
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,979
where resided both
physically and logically.

834
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,880
And it could just be,

835
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,380
this is an organization that

836
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,510
primarily had on premises systems.

837
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,690
There was no need,

838
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,280
because it was always in
one specific data center

839
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,260
or on premises locally.

840
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,210
But as businesses and
organizations mature,

841
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,210
you may move to different
environments, include cloud here.

842
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,570
So it's just something again,

843
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,409
where we document what
the current processes are.

844
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,410
And so you can kind of
understand where to build

845
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,510
from there as far as
where the data resides.

846
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,530
No specific regulations do require

847
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,100
that certain types of data reside

848
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,550
in certain localities or
countries, geographic locations.

849
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,139
So depending on the types
of information processed,

850
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,600
it will be

851
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,939
something that the organization
needs to understand.

852
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,773
And again,

853
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:30,080
focusing on those
critical business systems

854
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
should be a first good start to understand

855
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,290
these are the critical systems
that our business relies on.

856
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,139
There'll be a likely to
have the types of data

857
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,760
that may have that type of restriction

858
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,430
around data locality
requirements, things like that.

859
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,617
So again, where we
documented what we know,

860
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:46,980
and we kind of understanding,

861
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,620
so we can sort of build a roadmap

862
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,790
and go forward.

863
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,874
To really understand,

864
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:54,720
are there anything that,
any additional practices,

865
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,010
or controls, that we either
need to put in place,

866
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,097
or that we may have in place,

867
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:01,690
and just move into the
appropriate processes

868
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,093
to apply to a specific practice.

869
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,350
- And please feel free to
add any questions you have

870
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,310
into the chat.

871
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,060
We'll be happy to address those as well.

872
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,893
As we're getting into

873
00:32:11,893 --> 00:32:16,090
the last example that we
have here for ID.IM-P8.

874
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,419
Data processing as mapped,

875
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,460
illustrating the data actions
and associated data elements

876
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
for the systems products, services,

877
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,470
and really just looking
at those interactions with

878
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,300
individuals and third parties.

879
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,280
So what we have, is we do have the data,

880
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,490
data maps have been created

881
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,070
for a subset of the critical systems.

882
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,129
So we're pretty consistent

883
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,670
that we've got a good handle
on our critical systems

884
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,190
across all of these
different subcategories.

885
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,580
But knowing that the data maps

886
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,770
currently only outline the systems,

887
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,930
and the expected data flow,

888
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,830
but we're not handling or not defining

889
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,310
those data actions or elements,

890
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,460
knowing that that's a gap

891
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,990
that we'll have to address moving forward.

892
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,150
So we just, yeah, in this example,

893
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,240
we pulled out, focused on one category

894
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,070
from the privacy framework here

895
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,460
that has the eight sub categories.

896
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,590
But really by, you could see,

897
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,220
we quickly walked through all of these

898
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,740
to capture, what do we know?

899
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,380
What do we not know?

900
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,390
Where are the gaps that we think we see?

901
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,950
But by just walking through this,

902
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,930
and defining this in one place,

903
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,840
and maybe pulling from some
of these other standards

904
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,070
and frameworks, and other
exercises we've done,

905
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,210
and having this together,

906
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,010
it now creates that centralized place

907
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,770
to help us streamline that process.

908
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,020
And we can then, if we
capture it in this way,

909
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,310
we can hand it off to
those different groups.

910
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,760
Like Mike had mentioned,

911
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,290
whether it's an IT team, or
maybe the cybersecurity team,

912
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,409
or my leadership, or other stakeholders

913
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,075
that are from the business,
that want to know,

914
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:39,810
how are we processing data?

915
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,800
What kind of privacy concerns do we have?

916
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,440
And being able to clearly show here,

917
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,350
where we know that we are doing things,

918
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,649
where we know there are gaps.

919
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,220
And then we can use this as a place,

920
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,080
it's kind of that jumping off point

921
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,659
for diving in a little bit deeper,

922
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,760
and figuring out where do we want to,

923
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,890
where do we want to learn more?

924
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,740
Where do we think those largest gaps are,

925
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,150
by looking in that gaps
column on the right.

926
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,767
And seeing where do we have

927
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,290
a paragraph of text instead of a bullet?

928
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,700
Or where have we put, you know,

929
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,260
none in on the notes column,

930
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,159
that we know we're not doing anything.

931
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,515
- And I think, yeah, like Kelly mentioned,

932
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,670
it's really, yeah, we started

933
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,960
with this example here is,
it's just one sub category,

934
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,270
so there are several within
the privacy framework.

935
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,650
But really understanding your inventory,

936
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,650
both the systems and data,

937
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,000
is really a key or core component

938
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,690
to kind of build it out the
rest of the privacy frameworks.

939
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,280
That's what we wanted to
start with this example here.

940
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,510
I think that's the exercise

941
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,550
that most organizations
will go through first

942
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,810
to kind of understand what, you know,

943
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,826
what do we have?

944
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,679
What systems do we have?

945
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,029
What data do we currently process?

946
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,219
And then from there, you can get into

947
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,899
the more mature, I guess,
different sub categories

948
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,940
to kind of understand, the processes

949
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,770
beyond understanding just
your inventory and systems.

950
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,850
And here I want to talk a
little bit about resources from,

951
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,400
specifically for the privacy framework.

952
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,940
So these are cross walks that the

953
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,120
community actually provides.

954
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,900
So you can see the link there

955
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,390
for the NIST Privacy Framework,

956
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,250
where they actually have these.

957
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,410
So these are, like I said,

958
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,549
provided by the privacy community.

959
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,635
And we've listed the ones here

960
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:12,710
against laws, regulations,
some against the standards.

961
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,780
And then other frameworks you'll see there

962
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,820
like cybersecurity framework
and even the A153 controls.

963
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,800
We did pull some of these into the example

964
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,060
we went through today,
but they're really there

965
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,730
for the community to kind
of use as that baseline

966
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,280
like we did with this walk
through of the scenarios.

967
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,050
So if you've mapped to some of
these other frameworks here,

968
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,170
you're not starting from zero,

969
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,680
you kind of understand
where you are currently.

970
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,980
I mean, you kind of build them in,

971
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,960
and certainly, you kind of
build them in, tailor 'em,

972
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,950
ensure that you're mapping
to the right pieces

973
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,370
within your organization.

974
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,665
But these are really here just as

975
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,280
informative, I guess, references,

976
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
and just help to kind of get started.

977
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,290
As you sorta build out your,

978
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,393
and augment your privacy program.

979
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,509
We also have some resources as well.

980
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,680
Our resources from Optic,

981
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,513
specifically the one there

982
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:02,120
at the privacy framework crosswalk,

983
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,520
which was the template.

984
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,270
It's essentially a blank template

985
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,692
that we have of the scenario

986
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,690
that we just walked through.

987
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,140
Therefore, for you all
to use as appropriate,

988
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,160
if you need to tailor and
bring in additional controls,

989
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,993
certainly use that.

990
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,279
But like I said, we've
used it with organizations.

991
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,850
We find it helpful to kind
of document that process.

992
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,200
They kind of have that crosswalk there,

993
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,379
but they're certainly there

994
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,040
and we have other templates as well

995
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,330
for both privacy and cybersecurity.

996
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,360
And then again, here we
have the NIST resources,

997
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,340
the privacy framework crosswalks
that we just went through.

998
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
And then also two use cases

999
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,233
that NIST provides that
provides additional detail.

1000
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,080
More in a text format,

1001
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,230
sort of what we did, how
organizations sort of

1002
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,219
approach privacy from a
baseline to kind of apply

1003
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,683
the privacy framework as
they're just starting out.

1004
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,580
Okay.

1005
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,060
- So, yeah, to wrap up here,

1006
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,320
and apply what you've learned today, yeah.

1007
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,050
We've got a few things
to do over the next,

1008
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,500
over the coming weeks
and months next week,

1009
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,160
so you can identify the
relevant regulations,

1010
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,049
what actually, what are you worried about?

1011
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,740
What applies to you that you need to meet?

1012
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,359
And start aligning that
to the privacy framework,

1013
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,100
using those crosswalks
that Mike mentioned,

1014
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,540
or the template that you could get

1015
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,529
from the Optic website.

1016
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,710
The first three months,

1017
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,270
you know, you, after
you've got that mapped out,

1018
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,776
you can start documenting
what you're doing today.

1019
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:25,690
Inventorying your data maps, and systems,

1020
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,080
getting that started, identifying
your privacy stakeholders.

1021
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,295
And then moving on past
that in the next six months,

1022
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:35,200
documenting your current state
across the whole framework.

1023
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,680
Really rolling out across
all the sub categories,

1024
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,500
and then begin prioritizing your gaps,

1025
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,080
and implementing capabilities

1026
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,243
in your privacy program, to
figure out how to improve.

1027
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,583
- Yes, so to wrap it up,

1028
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,070
it's really take action (laughs) early

1029
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,151
what we're saying here.

1030
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:52,870
Like Kelly mentioned, I mean,

1031
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,210
there are a lot of things that

1032
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,460
can be done in kind of moving forward.

1033
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,980
Hopefully this will be
helpful to kind of use

1034
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,570
to kind of build out as
you kind of walk through

1035
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,320
building out and maturing
your privacy framework.

1036
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,670
But yeah, it's really just
to take that first step.

1037
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,480
It may seem daunting at
first, but yeah, really,

1038
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,030
kind of start with what you know,

1039
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,740
and you kind of move
forward as you build out.

1040
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,852
And with that, we thank you for

1041
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:15,569
watching our presentation today.

1042
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,110
And hopefully, keep the questions coming.

1043
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,180
We really enjoy answering your questions

1044
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,482
throughout the presentation.

1045
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,080
- Thank you very much.
