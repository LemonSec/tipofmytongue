1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,940
- Hi, I'm Brad Arkin.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,525
I'm the Chief Security and
Trust Officer here at Cisco.

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:07,550
And I wanna take you through

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,730
our Zero Trust architecture rollout.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,060
From zero to hero.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,570
How we deployed Zero Trust in five months.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,700
For the agenda today, we're
gonna start out by defining

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,650
what do I mean when I say Zero Trust?

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,470
Zero Trust has a lot of definitions

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,799
depending on who's talking.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,900
I wanna define very clearly
what Zero Trust means for me

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,279
and the context of this
description and this roll out.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,900
The next thing I wanna talk about

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,170
is the Zero Trust Landscape.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,170
And so what does your
organization have today

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,290
sitting out there in the environment

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,200
and what incremental building
blocks do you need to deploy

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,620
in order for you to be ready
for a Zero Trust roll Out

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,330
for your environment?

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,570
And finally, I'm gonna take you through

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,064
exactly the different steps
that we took here at Cisco

22
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,550
to do our Zero Trust Deployment.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,290
And we did it in just a few months.

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,140
And so sit back I'm gonna take you through

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,305
all of those details as
we get into the bit of it.

26
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:04,388
The first thing I wanna
do is make sure everyone

27
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:08,256
understands what we mean when
we talk about Zero Trust.

28
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:11,970
Zero Trust is become a
marketing term that has so

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,030
many different definitions
that you can apply it

30
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,387
to just about anything.

31
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:18,850
In the context here that
I'm talking about Zero Trust

32
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,770
for this presentation,
the important points

33
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,859
for us are captured here on the slide.

34
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,869
The most important thing
is we wanna move beyond

35
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,780
using user passwords

36
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,239
and relying on the
message security control.

37
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,228
The real focus is looking
at the user certificate

38
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,366
that we associated with a user

39
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:40,146
and then a device
certificate that we associate

40
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:43,228
with each particular
device the user might use.

41
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,737
And so if you have a phone,
a mobile tablet, a laptop

42
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,929
you might have three
different device certificates

43
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,459
associated with one user certificate.

44
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,180
And in combination, we know
that user A has device B

45
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,447
and together, when you
make a connection request

46
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,970
we can then start to ask questions

47
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,760
around the device posture,

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,630
is this device appropriately patched?

49
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,120
Is it configured the way it's
supposed to be configured?

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,400
And all of that gives us
a health determination.

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,980
And if we like what we're learning

52
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,950
through that health check process,

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,380
the next step would be
to issue a multifactor

54
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,240
authentication challenge to the end user.

55
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,041
And so this might be a push notification

56
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,367
that the user can respond to and say,

57
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,530
"Yep, that's me I initiated the request

58
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,630
I'm now ready to go."

59
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,810
Now where things might go different is

60
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,750
what resource the user
is working to connect to.

61
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,770
In some cases it might be a
third party SaaS application.

62
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,925
That's hosted somewhere
out on the internet.

63
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,390
And on this diagram here

64
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,799
we have that indicated by Salesforce.

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,510
And so if you're connected to Salesforce

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,394
then the connection would flow directly

67
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,336
to that third party, SaaS interface.

68
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:55,500
Another flavor of connection
would be the user connecting

69
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,291
to what was previously an
on-prem deployed service.

70
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,411
And in this example, we have
the Cisco corporate intranet.

71
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,404
Now, in this case, in the old
days, you could only connect

72
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:10,760
to this service by first
initiating a VPN connection.

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,590
And then once on the corporate network

74
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,578
you could then connect
to the internet website.

75
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:17,679
What we wanna move towards is basically

76
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,658
SaaSifying this on-prem service

77
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,358
and making it available to
the user wherever they are.

78
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,910
If they're in a Starbucks,
if they're at home

79
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,049
if they're on an airplane

80
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,860
the connection should just
flow through and work.

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,270
And from the end user perspective

82
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,709
they don't need to know the difference

83
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,599
between a third party cloud
hosted SaaS application

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,230
and an on-prem application that's managed

85
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,690
and hosted internally by Cisco.

86
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,260
The user experience on the
back end should be the same

87
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,077
regardless of how it's deployed.

88
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,119
So this is what we mean by Zero Trust

89
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,901
and everything else that we
talk about in this presentation

90
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:54,391
we'll be taking you through
the journey of what we deployed

91
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:57,810
how we rolled it out, and
how we did it so quickly

92
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,391
to get it rolled out in just a few months.

93
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:04,060
So the Cisco Zero Trust Architecture.

94
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,740
In the beginning you've
got your on-prem apps

95
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,930
that are off on the left

96
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,350
and you've got your SaaS apps

97
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,030
that are off on the right.

98
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,170
In the middle, you've got this DMZ.

99
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,479
And so what we want to achieve is

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,740
whether you're an end
point deployed internally

101
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,928
within the Cisco Corporate Network

102
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,869
or externally sitting in a Starbucks,

103
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,969
sitting at home, somewhere off premise

104
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:29,060
we wanna be able to create
these exact connections

105
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,760
so that regardless of which
end point you're sitting at

106
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,147
you can connect to all of these
different types of services.

107
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,849
That's the goal.

108
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,938
And so what we find is that most people

109
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:40,986
within your corporate environment today

110
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:44,128
you're gonna have some kind
of enterprise single sign on.

111
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,760
You're going to have some
type of directory service

112
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,460
which we have here labeled
with AD for active directory,

113
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,399
and then some kind of identity provider.

114
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,668
The identity provider can
do some checks to make sure

115
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,330
depending on what app
you're trying to connect to

116
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,308
do you have their permissions,
are you on the right group?

117
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:01,300
Have you authenticated accurately?

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,420
So they're providing whatever that single

119
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,809
or multifactor authentication is.

120
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:07,159
And so pretty much every organization

121
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:10,010
looks like this in the beginning.

122
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,950
And then the question is

123
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,610
how can we then deploy the
Zero Trust components we need

124
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,759
in order to achieve that
true Zero Trust architecture

125
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,600
that we define on the previous slide?

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,634
And so here at Cisco, what we did was,

127
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:25,427
we rolled out a few new
pieces to the architecture.

128
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:26,976
So starting in the middle

129
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:29,765
maybe the most important
pieces of the network gateway.

130
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:33,159
This is what allows external end points.

131
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,852
So that laptop sitting in a Starbucks

132
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:37,493
to connect through the network gateway

133
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,464
to then get to the on-prem apps.

134
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,013
That is probably the most
interesting piece here.

135
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:45,580
And there are some people
who feel very threatened

136
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,000
by this network gateway deployment

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,224
and they say, "No, no, it's
inappropriate, it's not fair."

138
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,763
You should only connect through the VPN

139
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:55,024
in order to get to your on-prem stuff.

140
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,860
For me, I don't understand
what the fuss is about

141
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,320
because what is a VPN,
if not a different name

142
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,567
form of network gateway,

143
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,062
that lets you go from the
outside to the inside.

144
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:07,330
For me, they're the exact
same thing, conceptually.

145
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,300
And if you implement it
properly and you configure it

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,270
in a way that's consistent
with your security outcomes

147
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,912
and your policies, I think
you can be just as secure

148
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:20,320
with a network gateway as
you would be with a VPN.

149
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,625
And so for me, it's a new component

150
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,880
but from a trust perspective

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,522
and we were relying on the
architecture to keep us safe.

152
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:30,603
I think if analogous to
what we have with VPNs.

153
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,080
So that network gateway in the top center

154
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,322
that's the first new piece.

155
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:38,722
The next piece is some kind
of Cloud certificate authority

156
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,880
and multi-factor authentication service.

157
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,145
And so we have that with the
green bubble off on the right.

158
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,419
There are other ways you
could actually deploy this

159
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,450
in a way that might be internal on prem.

160
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,080
In our model, we use a
cloud provider to do this.

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,553
And so that's deployed on the right

162
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:55,554
and that is going to deliver
us the posture checks,

163
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:58,799
the certificate checks that we're doing.

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,190
And then another thing that we have

165
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,250
is a certain management infrastructure

166
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,207
which is on the far left of the slide.

167
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,328
And what certificate
management does for us

168
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:10,049
it is it lets us keep track
of every device certificate

169
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,120
and every user certificate

170
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,550
in what is associated with what.

171
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,537
So that we can look these up

172
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:16,299
and make sure the cert
hasn't been revoked,

173
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,846
make sure it's still valid
and signed by the right CA.

174
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,556
And then if all of these things pass

175
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:24,039
then we can move that device
onto its next sequence

176
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,716
in the workflow for the Zero
Trust authentication process.

177
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:30,136
And so with these new pieces here

178
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:33,397
what this allows us to do
is it creates a pathway

179
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,147
for the off-premise end points

180
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,592
to connect to those on-premise apps.

181
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,190
And we also have the ability

182
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,250
for the on-prem end points
to connect to the SaaS apps

183
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,596
that are externally hosted.

184
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,016
So all of this together
now gives us what the

185
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,646
main components are of the
Zero Trust architecture,

186
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:53,630
and how the information
flows go back and forth

187
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,230
to deliver that Zero Trust experience

188
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,108
that we defined on the previous slide.

189
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,520
Okay, so some quick ground rules here

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,080
in terms of what is the scale

191
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,320
of the environment that we need to manage?

192
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,530
So we've got well over a
hundred thousand end points

193
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,556
that are pretty evenly split
between Mac and Windows.

194
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,719
And those are just the laptops.

195
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,646
We have a equally large
number of mobile devices

196
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,737
which would include iOS,
Android, phones, and tablets.

197
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,857
And so it's a very large set
of employed managed devices.

198
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,203
And then the number of user authentication

199
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,864
when we rolled out our pilot,

200
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,441
we were seeing about 10,000 a day.

201
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,479
And this number has gone up dramatically.

202
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,860
Now that we've got a general availability

203
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,693
for the population.

204
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:36,225
And in the beginning,
we started with a group

205
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:40,510
of about 20 applications
that were previously hosted

206
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,042
on-prem, only accessible through VPN.

207
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,625
And through this project

208
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,004
we wanted to publish and expose
through the network gateway.

209
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:50,870
So they'd be accessible
to manage the end points

210
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,780
that we're working through that

211
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,959
Zero Trust workflow.

212
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,926
And so we started with about 20.

213
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,200
We think that there
might be several hundred

214
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,190
when it's all said and done,

215
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,250
that we're gonna enroll in this process

216
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,128
but maybe only at the top hundred or so

217
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,309
are used widely across the company.

218
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,740
And so we wanted to start

219
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,378
with a core set that were really important

220
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,870
the very basic things like
the corporate intranet,

221
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,703
the corporate directory,

222
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:14,288
and things that people use
every day throughout the day.

223
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,230
And if we can get those workflows working

224
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,289
through the Zero Trust architecture

225
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,240
then we could start to pick
up after we've gone live

226
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,318
the more exotic services and applications

227
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:27,439
that are used by a smaller
percentage of the company.

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,440
And the goal here is
that we wanted to include

229
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,520
all of the different end point devices

230
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,460
that our users use throughout the day.

231
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,110
And so it's not just laptops,
it's not just workstations

232
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,618
but includes mobile devices

233
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:44,410
and headphones, handhelds and tablets.

234
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,900
So this is the sort of the
chess board that we started with

235
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,910
in terms of what we needed to get done

236
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,360
to get Zero Trust rolled
out in this environment.

237
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,200
The hardest part of this entire
project is making sure that

238
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,639
everyone involved understands
the transformational nature

239
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,639
of getting to Zero Trust
architecture goal now.

240
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,479
This is not an incremental change

241
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,800
that we could just deploy a
new component and then move on.

242
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,319
We needed a lot of different
teams from across the company

243
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,728
to get involved and understand,

244
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,130
we're really looking to
transform the end user experience

245
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,018
for how they access these
corporate resources.

246
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:26,658
And to give it the attention
and the time that it deserves.

247
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:31,480
And making that decision and
leaping in with both feet

248
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,420
is what allowed us to get
this project done so quickly

249
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,750
because everyone understood
that this was not a business

250
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,680
as usual incremental improvement,

251
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,670
but it really dramatic
before and after change.

252
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,410
And once everyone was on board with that

253
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,350
they understood the change
that needed to happen.

254
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,700
Then we were able to move forward

255
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,280
with a really good project plan

256
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,678
and make this roll out
happen very quickly.

257
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:56,078
But making that decision
collectively as a group

258
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,499
across the entire company
that we needed to leap

259
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:01,689
that was definitely the
hardest part of the project.

260
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,497
And so having made that
decision the next part for us

261
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,670
became just a matter of
executing across the timeline.

262
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,438
And so we started small in
the lab getting the components

263
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,964
working together to prove that it can work

264
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,940
and then building up the infrastructure

265
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,061
though we know it will scale

266
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:22,009
for the load that we intend
to deploy on this environment

267
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,490
and then getting ready
for the pilot group.

268
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,360
And the pilot had 35,000 users in it.

269
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,070
So it was a very big set of
users that we went forward

270
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,525
with a pilot and about 20 applications

271
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,410
that we did when we did
the initial wheel of life.

272
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,250
And then from there, we
were able to scale out

273
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,140
to cover the rest of the company
and then start to ramp up

274
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,120
the number of applications
that are supported.

275
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,707
And as we got that rolled out

276
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:48,330
we didn't have to do as much advertising

277
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,520
because people would click
a link in their email.

278
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,098
It would just open up in the browser.

279
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,820
They weren't on VPN.

280
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,140
They didn't even realize they're using

281
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,245
the Zero Trust Architecture

282
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,405
because everything had
happened behind the scenes

283
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:01,380
where we were deploying the certificates

284
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,290
out to these end points,

285
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,131
getting the network gateway configured

286
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,160
and getting all the browsers configured

287
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,209
so that when you just click
the link, it would just work.

288
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,357
And so for the end
users, for most of them,

289
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:13,678
no training, no direct outreach
or contact much required

290
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:15,975
because it worked the
way they expected it to

291
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,597
and started getting an
error message that said,

292
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,059
"Oh you've got to connect to VPN."

293
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,502
And so that was really
satisfying to see the usage

294
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:25,150
numbers go up so dramatically
once we went live.

295
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,996
So now that we are live,
the next steps here

296
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:31,305
are expanding this Zero Trust Architecture

297
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,500
to include the mobile end points.

298
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,730
So you get the same kind of
experience that you have today

299
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,645
from the laptops working on
the mobile devices as well.

300
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,370
We also want to make it a lot easier

301
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,672
to onboard future applications

302
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:46,160
so that when they're connecting in

303
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,130
getting the new application onboarded

304
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,490
and getting that connected into
the Zero Trust architecture

305
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,890
should be as easy as possible.

306
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,381
So for every new acquisition we make

307
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,870
we can get them onboarded and enrolled

308
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,220
in the Zero Trust architecture
as seamlessly as we can.

309
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,173
And then also looking at understanding

310
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:05,144
how do we support partners,
third parties that we work with,

311
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:07,230
where they may not be
on managed end points

312
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,195
but they're using their
own corporate hardware.

313
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,184
They still need to connect
to certain services.

314
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,863
So how are we gonna handle
those types of edge cases

315
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,480
which are a little bit more exotic

316
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,613
than what we had supported
in the initial roll out?

317
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,800
All of that has to come from us

318
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,142
but the initial deployment from
when we started the project

319
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:25,276
to when we went live just a few months.

320
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,697
The communication goals that we had here

321
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:30,502
was to make sure that
every team that we needed

322
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:34,079
involved in the critical path
of the project deployment

323
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
understood their role,

324
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,990
understood the transformational nature

325
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,374
of the work that we're deploying

326
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,500
and that it wasn't
something they could defer

327
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,610
for a year or two years, but
they needed to get lined up

328
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,777
to the aggressive schedule
that we had put forward.

329
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:48,350
And making sure that those
folks understood the priority,

330
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,766
understood they couldn't say no thanks,

331
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,130
but they could say, I need extra help.

332
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,988
I need more resources.

333
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,396
I need help adjusting my
priorities to make room for this.

334
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:59,097
That was really one of the
biggest communication goals

335
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,140
for the rest of the end-users.

336
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,920
It was just a, Hey,
it's coming, stay tuned

337
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,270
and things are gonna change.

338
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,140
If you're very perceptive
of your surroundings

339
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,391
you might notice that the
workflows are evolving.

340
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:11,260
Don't be scared here's what's
happening in the background.

341
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,300
And so getting that information rolled

342
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,010
out to the broader population was there.

343
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,262
That was more for folks
that would be interested.

344
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:19,111
The main focus of the communication

345
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,852
for the critical path project teams

346
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,850
was to make sure that they
understood they're involved

347
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,161
in helping to transform the company

348
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,651
and how we connected
from external end points

349
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,560
to these on-prem applications.

350
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,829
We did a lot of work at Sprinklr in deduce

351
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,810
that this project was coming
when we had all hands meetings.

352
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,430
So with our CIO and me
talking with each other,

353
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,420
my boss had some staff
meetings where we talk

354
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,435
about the project and potential headaches

355
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,486
or friction that were running into

356
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,420
and all of these things
help to keep the pressure on

357
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,295
so that if we did stumble
in the project execution

358
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,886
we could spot that quickly,

359
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:57,024
bring in the incremental
resources we needed to get unstuck

360
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,436
and then keep moving.

361
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,817
And that proved to be really,
really helpful for us.

362
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:05,440
The other thing was very
useful, was a steady cadence

363
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,090
of communication to project stakeholders.

364
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,530
That's just in the form of a
Friday afternoon (indistinct).

365
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,939
And so each week leaders
would get this email

366
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,860
and it'd say, "Hey, we're seven
days closer to going live.

367
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,902
Here's the countdown timer.

368
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,601
Here's what we got done in the past week.

369
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:18,852
Here's, what's coming up next."

370
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:22,400
And there's a section labeled
things where we're stuck

371
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,589
where we're feeling blocked,
things where we need help.

372
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,222
And so we could that get
attention over the weekend

373
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:29,829
and come in Monday morning
to get these things

374
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,233
unblocked and then keep moving.

375
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,936
And that was the goal
for the communication

376
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,384
just to make sure that we didn't slow down

377
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,960
or get stuck going down some rabbit hole

378
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,010
that might take us weeks to recover from.

379
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:44,510
So in the end, what we got from this was

380
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,750
a vastly improved end-user experience

381
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,060
for what it's like to connect
from an external end point

382
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,798
to an on-premise application.

383
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:56,160
We did so not only did we not
reduce our security posture

384
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,400
but we enhanced it,

385
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,230
because we're now getting
these moment-to-moment posture

386
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,520
and health checks at the end point

387
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,518
and the way it's configured.

388
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:04,450
And so if someone makes a bad mistake

389
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,214
and they misconfigure
something throughout the day

390
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,760
we can spot that and intervene
and have the infrastructure

391
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,319
in place to give a message to the user

392
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,440
that had to create corrective
action before they're able to

393
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,408
access the sensitive
resources that they desire.

394
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,107
And so being able to
intervene right at that moment

395
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,680
it's allowed us to maintain
much better security hygiene

396
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,215
for the fleet and also to reach people

397
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,867
right when they're looking
to access information

398
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,397
as opposed to doing
something after the fact

399
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:32,105
and that's been really helpful for us.

400
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,528
And what we now have

401
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,627
with this new set of checkpoints

402
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,967
is basically a broader set
of governance opportunities.

403
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,430
And overall, this is gonna
provide building blocks

404
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,637
for us to deploy, do security
capabilities in the future.

405
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,032
That's gonna make me
feel much more confident

406
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:51,140
as we meet the new threats that we see

407
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,564
in the world that we're living in.

408
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:54,640
And so for all of you

409
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,850
my goals today with our time together

410
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,576
is that you had the chance to learn about

411
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:02,455
how to take your current
deployment and infrastructure

412
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,109
which likely doesn't
have any network gateway

413
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,754
or the certificate management components.

414
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:09,079
And then what are the
incremental building blocks

415
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,925
that you need to deploy

416
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,399
in order to get ready for Zero Trust?

417
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,440
We defined what Zero Trust
means in this context

418
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,160
because it's become a term that
can be very broadly applied

419
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,136
to a lot of situations.

420
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:21,714
And what are the different steps

421
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,582
and milestones in your project plan

422
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,104
that you need to have in place

423
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,262
in order to have a successful roll out.

424
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,774
And that this is not the kind of project

425
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:29,994
that has to take three years

426
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,955
is something that we can
squeeze in and do a lot tighter.

427
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:35,730
And in this environment
with a very large set

428
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,130
of user deployments, we're
able to roll this out

429
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,639
while a hundred percent of the
population working from home

430
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,984
in just a few months.

431
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:45,530
And finally some best practices around

432
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,127
how to loop and leverage
your stakeholder community

433
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:49,850
and make sure that you
have good communication

434
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,310
going back and forth,

435
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,376
so that when you do hit points
of friction in the project

436
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,260
you're able to clear those

437
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,637
and keep going and keep up
with the project schedule.

438
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,770
The Zero Trust architecture roll out

439
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,230
was a very exciting project for us.

440
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,250
It allowed us to completely
change the way the end users

441
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,870
within our environment,
access their services

442
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,879
that they need to get their jobs done.

443
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,272
And we got it done in such
a short period of time,

444
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:18,621
this involved, not just the
communication work we have,

445
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,571
the aggressive technology roll out

446
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,980
but a lot of people coming together

447
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,510
and understanding from the beginning

448
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,403
that this is a transformative project

449
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:29,182
for how the company
rolls out new technology

450
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:31,632
that's touching every
corner of our workflow.

451
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,191
Is a lot of fun to share
these details with you.

452
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,640
And I'm really happy if
you have questions to ask

453
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,190
we can talk about it.
