1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,460
- Good morning everyone,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,140
thank you for attending this presentation

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,260
on faulty assumptions, why
intelligent sharing fails.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,500
My name is Michael Daniel

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,400
and I am currently the President and CEO

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,110
of the Cyber Threat Alliance.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,570
CTA is a nonprofit that
enables cybersecurity providers

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,960
to share threat
intelligence with each other

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,140
in both automated and
human to human fashion.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,410
The findings, implications
and recommendations

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,070
in this presentation are
mine but they largely stemmed

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,160
from my experience in making CTA work

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,840
as an information sharing organization.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,800
While many topics generate eye-rolls

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,650
from cybersecurity practitioners,

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,610
information sharing is
one of the few topics

17
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,250
that can produce the same response

18
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,420
in policy circles as well.

19
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,780
We seem to talk endlessly
about information sharing

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,320
and virtually every cyber
security panel study or review,

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,980
from the last half century,

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,730
seems to have an information
sharing recommendation in it.

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,860
Further, no one is really
against information sharing

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,620
at least in theory.

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,260
Yet information sharing
never seems to quite work.

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,240
It doesn't help the way
that it's supposed to

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,910
or it doesn't seem to solve the problems

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,520
the way that it's supposed to,

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,490
or it occurs only in a
trickle and fades out,

30
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,490
or it just doesn't happen at all.

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,059
Basically, information sharing
rarely lives up to the hype.

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,210
And so the real question is, why?

33
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,229
The answer it clearly
isn't for lack of trying,

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,150
we've got plenty of examples
of initiatives or efforts.

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,300
I also don't think it's really
the legal impediments either.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,520
I don't want to entirely
dismiss the legal concerns

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,530
but in many cases, those
concerns have been addressed

38
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,970
through various pieces of
legislation over the years

39
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,840
but information sharing
is still not happening.

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,970
So my contention is that we have made

41
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,370
some faulty assumptions
about information sharing.

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,760
As a result the foundation for most of our

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,910
information sharing efforts is flawed.

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,899
And since the foundation is flawed,

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,800
the resulting activities and initiatives

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,880
also suffer from some
fundamental weaknesses.

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,452
So just what are these flawed assumptions?

48
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,060
Based on my time at the
White House and CTA,

49
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,570
we've identified three assumptions

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,109
that seem to underpin most
information sharing initiatives.

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,600
The first is that cyber threat information

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,950
consists primarily of technical data.

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,100
That is, indicators of compromise

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,783
such as IP addresses and malware hashes.

55
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,440
And that it is primarily that kind of data

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,130
that we're looking for
information to be shared on.

57
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,630
Second, a second assumption
is that all organizations

58
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,480
should be sharing that technical data,

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,820
that everyone should be
participating in efforts

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,090
to move that kind of data
around the ecosystem.

61
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,980
And the third assumption is
that sharing should be easy.

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,290
Once the connections are
made between organizations,

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,030
in effect, it's like saying
once you have the pipes

64
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,440
hooked up, the information
should just flow.

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,650
And all three of these
assumptions are essentially wrong.

66
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,520
And because they are wrong,

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,270
initiatives and efforts
built on them often fail.

68
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,540
So let's talk about how they are wrong.

69
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,620
So first of all, cyber threat information

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,120
clearly consists of more
than just technical data.

71
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,670
There's information that
a particular IT product

72
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,980
has a vulnerability that
needs to be patched.

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,170
That is cyber threat information.

74
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,630
Sure, there's technical information

75
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,350
that goes underneath that,

76
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,060
but the fact of the need for
a patch is not technical,

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,453
but it's very relevant
to many organizations.

78
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,220
So clearly not the only kind
of information is not CTI,

79
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,350
is not technical data,
but we've tended to act

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,850
as if that's the only kind
of CTI that actually matters.

81
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,799
Second, we act as if all
organization should share that data

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,640
but the truth is that most organizations

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,890
cannot produce or consume technical data.

84
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,450
In fact, most organizations
are pretty lousy at it

85
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,220
and they always will be.

86
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,940
And that shouldn't
really be very surprising

87
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,240
because most non-profits
companies, government agencies,

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,920
have actually remarkably
little cyber capability.

89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,530
So why do we think that
sending those organizations

90
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,930
a bunch of IP addresses or
hashes will do any good?

91
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,400
And why do we say you should share

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,620
what you see on your network

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,990
when most of them aren't
going to see anything at all.

94
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,960
It just doesn't make any sense.

95
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,530
And finally sharing is in fact not easy.

96
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,140
Connecting the pipes is insufficient.

97
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,550
Sharing is actually remarkably hard work.

98
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,640
And the fact that we needed to create

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,919
an entire dedicated nonprofit like CTA,

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,130
to make sharing work in
the cybersecurity industry

101
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,800
is just one very clear example of how hard

102
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:32,520
sharing and sharing effectively really is.

103
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,049
So particularly if you
want to share at scale,

104
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,800
if you want to share
at a speed that matters

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,450
and you want to do so with high quality

106
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,460
over an extended period of
time, that's going to take work

107
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,849
and simply connecting the pipes
is not gonna be sufficient.

108
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,110
So let's take each one of these
faulty assumptions in turn

109
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,160
and explore them in a little more detail.

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,080
So once you thinking and analyzing,

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,270
the diversity of CTI
becomes readily apparent.

112
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,700
There's all sorts of different
kinds of information.

113
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,550
There's warnings about malicious activity.

114
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,900
There's proofs of concept about exploits,

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,349
there's attribution.

116
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,820
In fact, there's a
plethora of information.

117
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,300
So if we're gonna move away
from an assumption that,

118
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,830
CTI is all about technical information,

119
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,560
how should we do that, how
should we organize our thinking

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,243
about cyber threat information?

121
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,100
Well, the first step we
can take is thinking about

122
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,850
the nature of the information.

123
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,980
Who uses it, what they
use the information for,

124
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,310
how fast that information changes

125
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,940
and what the timeframe is
for using the information.

126
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,100
Using those kinds of questions as a guide,

127
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,150
we can actually see four broad categories

128
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,760
of cyber information, technical, tactical,

129
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,393
operational and strategic.

130
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,080
Now technical information is exactly

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,370
what we've been talking about.

132
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,973
And so some CTI certainly is technical.

133
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,980
And that's your IP addresses,

134
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,750
whether they're good, bad or unknown.

135
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,480
Malware, hashes, and
other kinds of things.

136
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,920
Now, this kind of information
needs to be used very quickly

137
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,470
and it's value degrades very rapidly.

138
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,220
And that's why we put that
down at the technical layer.

139
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,510
The tactical layer, the next
level up gives you information

140
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,053
about specific instances
of malicious activity.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,950
And this kind of information

142
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,440
tends to last a little bit longer

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,080
although it's still fairly short term

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,090
but it's measured more
in days or maybe a week.

145
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,599
And it's really used to make
adjustments on your network,

146
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,560
make adjustments to configurations

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,613
or to specific devices on your network.

148
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,700
Operational information is the
next layer up from tactical.

149
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,050
And this is the kind of information

150
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,880
that helps more senior personnel
make system-wide decisions.

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,159
Like, how often should
we patch our networks?

152
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,440
And then finally, there's strategic CTI.

153
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,440
This is the type of CTI that
doesn't change very often.

154
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,450
And it's measured over the
course of months or years.

155
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,740
Things like the kind of targets
that the Chinese government

156
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,500
might be going after to
steal intellectual property

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,320
to benefit their own companies

158
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,740
or the rise of ransomware
as a significant threat.

159
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,440
This type of CTI should influence

160
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,340
broader strategic activities
of an organization

161
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,190
and are really intended for
the most senior personnel

162
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,173
in a given company.

163
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,960
So now once we have
this framework laid out,

164
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,580
we actually want to take
the different kinds of CTI

165
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,800
that might be out there

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,080
and try to fit them into this framework.

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,390
So that's what we've
done on this next slide.

168
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,610
So if we take these
categories and generalize

169
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,153
the types of CTI we often deal with,

170
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,060
we identified really about
11 different types of CTI

171
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,760
spread across the four categories.

172
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,060
And you can see them here.

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,940
Now, these are the ones
that we have identified

174
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,480
based on our sharing activities.

175
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,300
And I'm sure that we'll eventually add

176
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,440
a few more types to this chart.

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,000
In fact, if you have
some additions right now,

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,630
you could go ahead and
put them in the chat.

179
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,360
If you have some that
you think about later on,

180
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm sure that we can find a way

181
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,000
for you to get in touch with me

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,540
because I would love
to know what those are.

183
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,130
But the key point about this is,

184
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,570
if you organize your thinking
about CTI in this way,

185
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,180
even though it's more complex,

186
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,170
it will allow you to use CTI

187
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,050
to answer a broader array
of questions and some more,

188
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,340
support more types of decisions.

189
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,250
And more importantly, it will
enable you to tailor the CTI

190
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,860
to the organization

191
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,883
and focus it on what the
organization actually needs.

192
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,760
In order to actually make use of that CTI

193
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,539
to make cybersecurity better.

194
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,943
And that leads me right into
the second faulty assumption.

195
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,020
The second faulty assumption
really relates to,

196
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,563
why organizations should share CTI.

197
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,309
The thinking, I think normally
goes something like this.

198
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,890
If sharing is good, more
sharing should be better.

199
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,420
And if more is better

200
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,189
then if we get a lot of
sharing, then that's great.

201
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,430
So if everyone shares, that
would be the best of all, right?

202
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,300
Except, it never seems
to work out that way.

203
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,699
And the reason why is
what we come back to from

204
00:08:58,888 --> 00:08:59,721
that beginning slide

205
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:02,130
we keep asking non-security organizations

206
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,700
to share highly technical CTI

207
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,730
and then wonder why they fail at it.

208
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,100
We need to think differently
about why an organization

209
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,060
might share CTI, why
they might consume CTI

210
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,723
and what they would get
out of those activities.

211
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,230
Now it's not exactly a revelation

212
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,650
that different organizations

213
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,280
have different information requirements

214
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,113
based on their business.

215
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,829
For example, the kind of
information a sports team needs

216
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,950
is very different than
the kind of information

217
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,200
that a bank is going to need.

218
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,290
They operate in vastly
different industries.

219
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,410
They use different information
for different purposes.

220
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,980
So their needs are going
to be very different.

221
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,190
Similarly, cyber threat
information needs to also differ.

222
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,500
And they're going to vary
on a array of factors

223
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
such as industry type,
size, geographic location,

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,220
business function, and so on.

225
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,050
So just as with any information type,

226
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,020
organizations will produce
and consume information

227
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,492
based on two really key factors.

228
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,140
One, is it relevant to
their business model?

229
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,069
And two, can they put it to use?

230
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,960
If you aren't meeting
either of those two needs,

231
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,100
relevancy and capacity
or comparative advantage,

232
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
then the information is
actually going to turn out

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,163
to be useless and it won't be
used or it won't be produced.

234
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
So let's take each of those two in turn.

235
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
So relevance, when it's looked
at from this protective,

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
and you start thinking about relevance,

237
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,100
what is relevant to a business?

238
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
The first thing that you
actually realize is that,

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,830
frankly most CTI types are irrelevant

240
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,880
for most organizations.

241
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,450
Most of those categories that
you saw back a few slides ago

242
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,820
simply aren't going to matter
for most organizations.

243
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,390
They aren't gonna be able to use it,

244
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,330
it's not clear how to relate to

245
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,070
any of their business systems.

246
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,630
The second thing is that
in fact most organizations

247
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,590
only need to make a very few number

248
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,540
of cybersecurity decisions

249
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,599
and they're not certainly
not making them every second

250
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
and they're not making
them even every day,

251
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,260
in many instances.

252
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,760
They're only occasionally making some

253
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,280
limited cybersecurity decisions.

254
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,060
And if these two conclusions are correct,

255
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,583
then there are some implications
that flow from that.

256
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,040
First, relevance to the
organization's business

257
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,880
is what should drive CTI sharing.

258
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,590
If you can't directly tie this,

259
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,320
the value of the sharing
to the business model

260
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
and the business needs
of the organization,

261
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,403
it's just not going to work.

262
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,050
And the second thing is that organizations

263
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,609
should only produce and consume CTI needed

264
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,410
for the decisions they need to make.

265
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,950
There's a lot of information out there,

266
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,290
and in fact most of us are drowning in it.

267
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,780
And so one of the key factors is

268
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,069
that you should only focus on
the CTI that you really need.

269
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,730
Of course, sometimes that
takes discipline and focus

270
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,220
to get down to that
information that you need,

271
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,530
but really should be only
the CTI that's needed

272
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,760
for making the decisions
that an organization has,

273
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,510
that are gonna be relevant to them.

274
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,040
Now, the other side of the
coin is comparative advantage,

275
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,380
which is an economic
term, but it's capacity.

276
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,540
What are you actually good at?

277
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,240
And the truth is that most organizations

278
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,090
aren't very good at the
technical side, that's okay.

279
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,680
It doesn't make sense for them to be.

280
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,870
It's not economically
sensible for them to be.

281
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,510
So we shouldn't expect them to,

282
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,790
and our programs and sharing activities

283
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,510
should recognize this fact.

284
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,510
However, it is also true
that most organizations,

285
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,290
even if they can produce and
consume certain CTI types,

286
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,209
they may not be the most
efficient or effective at it.

287
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,207
And that's why I included the
concept of not just capacity,

288
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:45,967
but comparative advantage.

289
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:50,800
And this tends to be true
specifically for governments.

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,430
Governments can often
produce technical CTI

291
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,709
but the private sector is
typically way more efficient

292
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,240
at that task.

293
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,540
And so just because the
government can produce

294
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,420
and share technical CTI through programs,

295
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,099
does not necessarily mean
that it should be doing that.

296
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,870
And so really in addition
to the relevance side

297
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,840
and the capacity side,

298
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,550
we're really thinking here
about comparative advantage.

299
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,229
Where are your comparative advantages

300
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,443
in what you produce and
in what you consume?

301
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,570
And so therefore comparative advantage

302
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,840
is what should drive CTI
production and its consumption.

303
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,140
So here is an example where
governments have an example,

304
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,840
have an advantage in
attribution and warning

305
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,360
because those types of information

306
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,280
benefit from intelligence capabilities.

307
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,130
And so there, that's not
a kind of information

308
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,240
that anybody else is really

309
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,210
typically going to be able to produce.

310
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,210
And so that's the kind of
analysis that you need to do

311
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,340
to determine how

312
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,800
you should be sharing
what you should be sharing

313
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,349
and where you should focus
your sharing efforts on.

314
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,250
So finally we come to what in some ways

315
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,490
is the most pernicious assumption.

316
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,180
The idea that sharing should be easy.

317
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,579
Now, actually it's fairly,

318
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,220
it's not surprising that we've kind of

319
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
fallen into this trap.

320
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,969
We've got a lot of many
large companies out there

321
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,300
who have made it their
mission to make sharing easy,

322
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,920
maybe a little too easy.

323
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,760
I mean, I think all of us have experienced

324
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,240
that moment of senders or more

325
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
after you've hit the enter key on an email

326
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,449
or posters remorse after you've

327
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,880
posted something on social media,

328
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,310
haven't been able to take it
down before it's proliferated.

329
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,420
The ease with which information in general

330
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,150
can move around the internet,
fools us into thinking that,

331
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,740
CTI sharing should therefore also be easy.

332
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,930
But it turns out that
sharing CGI effectively

333
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,262
over the long-term is really hard.

334
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,329
Now we know this, we could see it.

335
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,860
There's plenty of evidence for it.

336
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,700
I mean the cybersecurity
landscape is littered

337
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,710
with the carcasses of dead
information sharing initiatives.

338
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,240
They get started to address a
particular threat or problem

339
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,710
and then they simply fade away.

340
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,560
That means that connecting the pipes

341
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,199
is not going to guarantee success.

342
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,790
And in fact, high-quality
information sharing

343
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,310
requires really four elements.

344
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,132
It requires trust, money,
time and attention.

345
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,630
So taking each one of those four in turn,

346
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,730
you know trust means that you can rely

347
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,010
on what the recipients of
the information you provide

348
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,630
will do with that information,

349
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,150
that they will handle it
and protect it properly.

350
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,689
Without trust people simply
are not going to share.

351
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,060
Now trust cannot be
manufactured or bought.

352
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,579
It has to organically grow over
time, which means that it is

353
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,633
something that results from investment.

354
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,459
The money part means
that sharing isn't free

355
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,600
or at least the kind that provides value.

356
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,930
Money is going to be required

357
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,620
in the form of subscription
fees or membership fees

358
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,650
or some sort of participation fees.

359
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,980
Regardless, what I would say
is that the free information

360
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,230
out there is probably good

361
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,760
but it's not going to be enough for you,

362
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,810
it's not gonna cut it.

363
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,369
You're gonna have to invest some money

364
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,230
into the sharing activities in
order to really get a return

365
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,920
and have it be useful for you

366
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,520
in protecting your organization.

367
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,220
Time means that either you
or someone on your team

368
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,880
has to spend part of their day working

369
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,820
on these sharing activities.

370
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,620
You can't just do it as
an occasional side project

371
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,880
or you'll get results that look like

372
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,283
an occasional side project.

373
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,780
And finally attention means
you have to get attention

374
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,980
seeing your level of support
for the sharing activities.

375
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,710
Otherwise they will falter

376
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,210
when it comes to finding the money

377
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,423
or keeping the effort going over time.

378
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,610
So now that we have, we've
gone through and looked at

379
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,210
these three faulty assumptions
and figured out why those,

380
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,590
the original assumptions about

381
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,390
technical cyber threat
information being technical,

382
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,877
that all information
organizations should share it,

383
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:50,010
and that it's easy, now that
we've kind of debunked those

384
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,240
and have identified some
alternative assumptions,

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
what are the implications of those?

386
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,959
So if we shift those assumptions,

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,210
get rid of the old faulty ones

388
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,283
and replace them with new more
realistic ones, what happens?

389
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,889
Well, I can identify at least
eight different implications

390
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,670
that come from these revised assumptions.

391
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,190
There's probably more,
but here are the ones

392
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,083
that I've picked out in particular.

393
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,849
One, few organizations are going to share

394
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,849
all the different types of CTI.

395
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,629
It's gonna be the pretty rare organization

396
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,329
that has a business need for
every single one of those

397
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,480
different 11 types of information.

398
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,800
Even at CTA, an organization
that specializes in CTI,

399
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,580
we don't share all of the CTI types.

400
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,230
That's not a shortcoming, it's a feature.

401
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,150
But it means that no
organization is gonna be

402
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,150
the single source of all CTI
or the recipient of all CTI.

403
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,890
Many public private
information sharing programs

404
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,150
are based on sharing technical CTI.

405
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,690
So this implication is
that those public private

406
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,030
information sharing
programs need to evolve,

407
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,180
to include other types of CTI,

408
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,950
depending on their target audience.

409
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,370
They need to be broader and
they need to really think about

410
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,060
what their audience is
and who their audience is

411
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,373
and what the information
is needed by that audience.

412
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,010
A third implication is that
information sharing programs

413
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,083
need to explicitly build trust.

414
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,879
Business rules and processes

415
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,860
all need to reinforce that trust.

416
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,129
It's not purely a technical
problem to be solved.

417
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,960
So you really have to actually
work on building that trust

418
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,843
and not just simply hope that
it will grow organically.

419
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,610
It is also, the flip side is,

420
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,300
that you don't have to
just completely focus

421
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,710
your information sharing
outputs on one type of CTI.

422
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,820
You can certainly combine types,

423
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,360
but you just have to stay
aware of your audience.

424
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,350
It doesn't mean we need 11 different types

425
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,090
of information sharing products for CTI.

426
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,050
It just means that you have
to be aware of your audience

427
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,530
and tailor what kind of CTI

428
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,822
you're putting in the products for them.

429
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,940
The fifth implication
is that we can reversely

430
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,310
reduce the number of organizations

431
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,600
expected to share technical data.

432
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,090
And that would improve our
ability to be efficient

433
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,510
and effective in those programs,

434
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,540
because it would be
focused on those entities

435
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,020
that actually can do that kind of sharing

436
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,570
and can make use of that kind of sharing,

437
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,929
which would sort of cut
out a lot of the noise

438
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,930
and cut down on the false
positives and raise the quality

439
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
of the information that is being shared.

440
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,700
Similarly, for those
that aren't cybersecurity

441
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,990
providing organizations,

442
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,210
focusing on relevance
and comparative advantage

443
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,340
would reduce the burden
of these sharing programs

444
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,810
and the risk of the sharing program,

445
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,139
so they're increasing their
value to the organization.

446
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,710
It'll make it much, if it's
focused on the business model

447
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,110
it'll make it much more obvious
how it actually benefits

448
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,410
the company or the organization.

449
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,010
It will answer that question
of what's in it for me.

450
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,739
Another implication is that
we need some standard formats

451
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,890
for things besides technical CTI.

452
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,160
We have the formats for technical CTI,

453
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,600
such as STIX, the structured
threat intelligence exchange

454
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,590
or MITRE ATT&CK, but we do
not yet have many standards

455
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,480
for non-technical CTI.

456
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,320
And so just as using the STIX framework

457
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,550
ultimately makes it easier
to share technical CTI,

458
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,919
having a standard framework
for some of these other

459
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,920
types of CTI such as best
practices for defensive measures

460
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,310
would also be very helpful.

461
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,360
And then finally, we know from experience

462
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,790
that creating a flash of the pan

463
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,840
for information sharing is easy

464
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,610
but effective CTI really requires planning

465
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,010
and a willingness to stick with it

466
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,393
even if the immediate return seems low.

467
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,130
So, those are the implications
of those revised assumptions.

468
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,110
But if we actually want to
put these revised assumptions

469
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,010
into practice, how would we do that?

470
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,390
Now, if we did put them into practice

471
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,490
we could dramatically improve

472
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,233
the volume and quality of CTI sharing.

473
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,690
Now, of course, like everything
about information sharing

474
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,170
it's really easy to say
that, but hard to do.

475
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,610
So to close out this talk,

476
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,179
I will discuss how using
these revised assumptions

477
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,373
might work in real life.

478
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,920
So these revised
assumptions leads logically

479
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,840
to some clear actions.

480
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,899
Again, these aren't
necessarily easy actions

481
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,940
but they flow naturally
from the changed mindset

482
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,240
about information sharing.

483
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,900
So the first one is that if CTI

484
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,590
comes in many different
flavors as it were,

485
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,720
then seek out some of those
new flavors, in other words,

486
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,130
seek out some new sources
of non-technical CTI.

487
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,660
If the CTI you've seen
or has been able to get,

488
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,040
hasn't helped you, it's probably because

489
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,860
it's not the right kind for your needs.

490
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,530
So look for those different sources,

491
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,430
whether from the government or an ISAC

492
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,280
or other reliable entity.

493
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,910
New sources might in fact, make
you aware of threats sooner

494
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,610
or just make it easier
for you to figure out

495
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,780
that there's a threat out
there that might affect you

496
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,980
and what to do about it.

497
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,470
Now, if organizations share or consume

498
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,310
different types of CTI,

499
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,780
you should focus on
what's relevant to you.

500
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,080
And so just because a
colleague or a friend

501
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
finds one type of CTI
useful in their context,

502
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,600
doesn't mean that you'll find it useful

503
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,679
in your current context.

504
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,890
And more is not always better.

505
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,930
We're often drowning in information.

506
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,880
So the right move for you might in fact be

507
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,980
to get rid of some CTI sources.

508
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,060
These moves will free
up resources for you.

509
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,740
It will allow you to connect CTI

510
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,970
to your business
operations more effectively

511
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,770
and increase the efficiency
associated with that effort.

512
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,220
And then finally, if sharing is not easy,

513
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,423
you've got to prepare to make
the investment over the term.

514
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,610
But it's and yes, that means
you need to take the long view.

515
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,610
Yes, there are a lot of threats
flying around the internet

516
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,479
on a daily basis, but it's more important

517
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,340
that you build a sharing program
over time that will endure

518
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,139
and provide benefit to
the company over the term.

519
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,800
And that's gonna take your time.

520
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,980
So it's okay to go slow and build up.

521
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,690
Crawl, walk run applies
to CTI sharing too.

522
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,480
Now applying these ideas will vary

523
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,800
depending on the organization

524
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,010
and your role within the organization.

525
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,780
So let's talk about some of
those different perspectives

526
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,100
For organizational leaders,

527
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,050
the kind of application that
you're gonna be thinking about

528
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,320
for these revised assumption

529
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,120
occurs at the very much
at the strategic level.

530
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,580
If you're in that kind of position then,

531
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,470
here are some examples of
the actions you could take.

532
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,557
You should be asking your
cybersecurity provider or staff,

533
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:30,240
what CTI would help your business?

534
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,143
What information do you really need?

535
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
What does your provider
or team need to know

536
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,640
to protect your business
operations and information?

537
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,480
Be upfront, ask those questions
because it's amazing to me

538
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,520
how often people don't ask those questions

539
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,933
and just work based on those
old faulty assumptions.

540
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,970
But the second part is then
once you've actually gotten

541
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,220
some of that information that you need,

542
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,840
you need to act on that
shared information.

543
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,800
It doesn't do your business any good

544
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,860
if you don't act on the
information you receive

545
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,919
or if you don't share useful
information when you have it.

546
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,130
So if the shared information indicates

547
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,660
you should make a change, do it.

548
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,120
Make sure your IT provider does it.

549
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,610
Or otherwise there's no real
point in you being involved

550
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,423
in the sharing activities.

551
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,270
You should periodically
assess the impact of sharing,

552
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,080
have your IT provider
collect some useful metrics

553
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,939
such as meantime between incidents

554
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,070
or the time to detect an incident

555
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,620
then examine how these
metrics change over time

556
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,750
and whether or not you can
tell if the sharing activities

557
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,880
you've been involved with
actually contribute to

558
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,360
changing those metrics
in the way that you want.

559
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,193
And then you can adjust

560
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:36,830
your sharing activities appropriately.

561
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,260
And then lastly, stay at
it, sustain that investment.

562
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,600
Sharing is not a one and done activity.

563
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,030
You'll have to maintain the effort

564
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,379
in order for it to provide
the level of benefit

565
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,213
that you need.

566
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,120
If you're leading a company cyber team

567
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,530
then your perspective is gonna
be a little bit different.

568
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,590
You're the one that's
gonna really be identifying

569
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,139
your company's cyber security decisions.

570
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,130
Now, as we were talking about,

571
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,400
some organizations may not
make decisions very often.

572
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,190
So knowing what decisions you need to make

573
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,660
tells you what information you need.

574
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,750
You need to identify what types of CTI

575
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,640
support those decisions.

576
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,110
It might only be one or two types

577
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,709
and you may not need it very
frequently, and that's okay.

578
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,510
You should create a plan to
get from where you are today

579
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,713
in terms of CTI, to where you want to be.

580
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,730
And as we were just discussing,

581
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,530
remember that that plan could
include dropping or unneeded

582
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,500
or duplicate CTI sources since
more is not always better.

583
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,330
The plan should enable you
to get the maximum useful CTI

584
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,230
for the least part and
aligning that your CTI

585
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,420
clearly with business needs
will help you secure resources

586
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,403
and maintain those resources over time.

587
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,389
And then finally, I would say,

588
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,100
make information sharing a criteria

589
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,560
when selecting cybersecurity providers.

590
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,919
Vendors that can
demonstrate how they share

591
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,430
will ultimately provide
you better cybersecurity

592
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,483
as an organization.

593
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,129
Now, of course, if you're
a cybersecurity provider,

594
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,290
these revised assumptions look
a little bit different again.

595
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,040
For one, if you adopt this
framework for discussing,

596
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,250
analyzing, and sharing CTI,

597
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,100
you can become much more intentional about

598
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,480
distinguishing between CTI types.

599
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,640
You can reduce confusion and
focus your messaging better,

600
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,560
and distinguishing between these CTI types

601
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,493
will improve the sharing outcomes.

602
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,130
You should also take the time to identify

603
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,070
your comparative advantage in CTI.

604
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,639
What specific type of CTI
does your company provide?

605
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,800
Not all providers will share
all types of CTI as we said.

606
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,399
Any more than a recipient will take

607
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,470
all the different types of CTI.

608
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,010
By focusing tightly on
the CGI that your company

609
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,840
has a comparative advantage in,

610
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,350
you will make yourself more competitive.

611
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,740
You're gonna have to invest
resources in sharing activities.

612
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,010
For too many people in the
cybersecurity industry,

613
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,879
information sharing is designated

614
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,640
as a other duty as assigned.

615
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,530
Instead, if you make it
CTI sharing an explicit

616
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,030
part of someone's job,
and you're gonna get

617
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,149
a lot more out of it.

618
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,160
If you make it an explicit
performance metric

619
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,100
for the company, you're going
to get a lot more out of it.

620
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,610
It'll allow you to actually
focus those resources on it

621
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,500
in a way that will be far
more beneficial to you.

622
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,620
And finally, don't just focus
exclusively on technology.

623
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,080
In making sharing work,
policies, processes

624
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,580
and the business models that are used

625
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,913
are just as important as the technology.

626
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,870
Finally, government agencies

627
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,909
have yet a fourth perspective on this.

628
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,180
They're coming at it from
a much broader perspective,

629
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,480
generally trying to get
sharing going across

630
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,750
large swaths of the cyber
ecosystem at one time

631
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,743
as opposed to just bilateral
sharing relationships.

632
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,230
So for government
agencies the real issue is

633
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,970
identifying their comparative advantage

634
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,270
and focusing their
limited time and resources

635
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,020
on where governments actually
bring advantage to the table.

636
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,570
And again, I will repeat,
it is almost assuredly

637
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,100
and in providing context
for the technical data

638
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
not providing the technical data itself

639
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,760
But as we were discussing earlier,

640
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,820
it means that government
should also refine

641
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,520
their existing sharing programs.

642
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,920
They should review those programs

643
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,650
to make sure that the
types of CTI being shared

644
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,700
match the needs of the program recipients

645
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,710
or the target audience of the program.

646
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,530
If you've got a low
participation rate in a program,

647
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,180
it could be because there's a mismatch

648
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,950
between the target audience

649
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,573
and what's actually being
provided through the program.

650
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
It is likely the case
that if you could increase

651
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,480
your strategic and targeted warnings,

652
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,090
that will be the best thing you could do.

653
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,280
Governments, because of
their access to intelligence

654
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,780
and law enforcement information,

655
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,830
could really shine in this area.

656
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,419
And then finally, you could
think about how to incentivize

657
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,620
CTI through public policy.

658
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,040
How can you reduce the economic burden

659
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,250
while increasing the
return on the investment

660
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,703
for those sharing activities
across the entire ecosystem?

661
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,550
So in conclusion, but I would
just want to say here is

662
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,360
that all the studies, panels
and reviews are not wrong.

663
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,399
Information sharing is an important,

664
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,010
even critical element in
effective cybersecurity.

665
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,920
Unfortunately, information
sharing has not lived up

666
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,170
to its promise due to how
we've approached the issue.

667
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,110
We've been using those bad assumptions.

668
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,070
So it's not surprising that the
results aren't what we want.

669
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,200
However, if we shift our assumptions

670
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,830
and operate on the basis that CTI

671
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,919
consists of many different
types of complex information,

672
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,770
that relevance and comparative advantage

673
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,350
should drive sharing,

674
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,800
and that sharing requires
long-term sustained investment,

675
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,970
then we will be able to make
sharing live up to its promise.

676
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,330
Of course, we're not
gonna solve cybersecurity

677
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,250
using information sharing,

678
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,170
that's a whole other presentation.

679
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,060
But improved CTI, that
lives up to its promise

680
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,590
would definitely make life
much tougher for the bad guys

681
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,300
and I'll take that outcome any day.

682
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,440
So thank you very much
for joining my talk today.

683
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm really looking forward to

684
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,437
when we can engage again
in-person, thank you.
