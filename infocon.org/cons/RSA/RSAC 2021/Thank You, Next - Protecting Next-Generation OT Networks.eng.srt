1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
- Hi, my name is Chris Williams.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,610
I'm with Capgemini.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,920
And I'm gonna talk to you all today

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,183
about Protecting
Next-Generation OT Networks.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,250
As for myself, I've been in
the IT space for quite a while.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,200
My former experience includes
military communications,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
government contracting,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,240
and now working with the commercial world.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,650
I've written four books on
cybersecurity management

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,369
including "Enterprise Cybersecurity"

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,140
which is used to teach
cybersecurity management

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,490
at over a dozen universities
around the world.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,777
And with that, let's
dive in (clears throat).

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,530
So over the course of the
next couple of minutes

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,070
we're gonna talk a little
bit about OT Networks,

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,100
for those of you who might
be new to this space.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,470
We're also gonna talk
about how OT Networks

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,820
have been changing over the past 10 years,

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,520
and then we're gonna
consider those changes

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,020
and how they're going to affect

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,840
how we need to be doing cyber
defense around these networks.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,350
And then finally, I'm
gonna try to leave you with

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,720
some actionable feedback

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,610
on how you can apply
some of these lessons,

25
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,400
how you can go back to your organization

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,530
and start making an impact

27
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,613
on protecting your OT environments today.

28
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,640
So first off a little
bit about OT Networks,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,787
and for those of us who grew
up in the IT space, it's like,

30
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:16,270
"What do you mean that
there's a computer network

31
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,679
that's running my power plant

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,280
or my water plant or the
back of my grocery store?

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,490
What's up with that?"

34
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,729
The reality is that these
are computer networks

35
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,260
that make the world go round

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,610
and they're doing incredible
things on an industrial scale

37
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,077
and what they've been doing

38
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:35,289
and how they've been impacting
us has dramatically grown

39
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,020
over the course of the past two decades.

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,833
And that's really the
significant component here.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,990
What is an OT Network in practice?

42
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,649
It used to be that it
was very specialized.

43
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,100
It used to be, it might've been
highly proprietary networks

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,312
or anybody who remembers Token Ring.

45
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,929
And since then, particularly
over the past three decades,

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,980
it's become a lot more standardized.

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,190
And so typically what we
see today on OT Networks

48
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,410
is that we've got controllers

49
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,619
that are connecting to
the exact same IP network

50
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,950
using the exact same internet technology

51
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,820
that we use in our back offices.

52
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,340
And then those controllers
may then be connecting

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,950
to dedicated devices
through dedicated circuits

54
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,640
or separate circuits, or it
may be that those devices

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,239
are also connecting to
the same IP networks.

56
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
One of the big trends
that we've been seeing

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
in particular over the past decade,

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,510
is just everything over IP and
also everything is wireless.

59
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,899
So all of these devices

60
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,373
that folks are going into plant floors,

61
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,950
and a lot of times they're
replacing a lot of copper wiring

62
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,119
with either just standard ethernet wiring

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,410
and ethernet switches

64
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,079
or perhaps the whole
thing is going wireless.

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,460
We're getting rid of the wires altogether.

66
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,360
But this Operational
Technology, these are devices,

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,040
they're sensors, they're
actuators, they're cameras,

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,510
they're access control devices.

69
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,450
One of the older types of OT Networks

70
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,910
that most organizations have

71
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,420
is your physical access control network.

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,440
And this is controlling your your doors,

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,972
your gates, your cameras.

74
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,130
And then of course. in
an industrial environment

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,609
or a clinical environment,

76
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,640
you're gonna have other
more specialized equipment.

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,140
And in particular, there's six use cases

78
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,640
that we frequently see with OT Networks.

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,049
One of them or three of them
on kind of the purple boxes

80
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,440
in the picture here.

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,010
These are our OT environments

82
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,519
that tend to be on your
classic IP networks.

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,980
These are IP services, it's smart printers

84
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,480
it's smart copiers, it's IP telephones.

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,619
Physical security generally
tends to stay isolated.

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,250
Although we've seen in environments

87
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,180
where folks have got their
physical access control

88
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,460
running over this exact
same office network

89
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,210
or perhaps just only lightly separated off

90
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,600
perhaps via VLAN or
some switch separation.

91
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,060
And then another one is HVAC,

92
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,990
your heating and air conditioning systems.

93
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,500
And of course, many of you
know about the Target hack.

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,210
And one of the ways that
that hack was perpetuated

95
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,400
was through an HVAC vendor
and using that to get access

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,340
into the inside of the Target network.

97
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,720
And then on the more industrial side,

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
three of the major
applications of OT Networks

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,130
are in healthcare,
manufacturing and utilities

100
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,950
and your SCADA networks.

101
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,089
And SCADA stands for

102
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,979
supervisory control and data acquisition.

103
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,150
So these are systems
that are used to control,

104
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,929
perhaps your big plants,
power converters valves,

105
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,530
actuators, and other types of sensors.

106
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,469
So heavy duty equipment all
controlled over your OT Network.

107
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,090
And in all of these, the big
pattern that we've been seeing

108
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,743
is greater amount of computing capacity,

109
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,450
greater numbers of sensors,
greater numbers of actuators,

110
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,840
greater numbers of devices.

111
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,310
If I had to put this
in orders of magnitude,

112
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,950
the amount of computing
capacity on your OT environment

113
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,260
has been increasing by one
to two orders of magnitude.

114
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,990
That's 10 to a hundred times as big

115
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,770
as it used to be over the
course of the past 20 years.

116
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,109
So these are very, very
significant evolutions,

117
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,720
and are making these
networks a lot more important

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,420
than perhaps they were previously.

119
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,500
So, how is this changing,
what's happening?

120
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,969
Well these networks,
they're becoming better,

121
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,210
they're becoming stronger,
they're becoming faster,

122
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,159
just like "The Six Million Dollar Man,"

123
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,370
but that also is making them
potentially more vulnerable.

124
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,160
And that also is making them a potentially

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,220
more attractive targets
to cyber attackers.

126
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,290
Certainly there's a lot
more that cyber attackers

127
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,420
can do attacking a modern OT Network

128
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,560
compared to a decade
ago or two decades ago.

129
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,993
So how do we protect these environments?

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,820
The classic model for
protecting these OT Networks

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,099
is called the Purdue Model.

132
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,570
It is in many ways, for
those of us old timers,

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,667
is the original zoned network.

134
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,229
And this model goes back to 1989.

135
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,120
Originally, it was actually framed out

136
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,530
as a framework for just talking about

137
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,659
and framing out supervisory
control of industrial systems.

138
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,750
And the identified,

139
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,630
hey there are different levels of control

140
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,170
going from where you're actually
hands-on with the devices

141
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,890
all the way up to where
you're doing budgeting,

142
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,150
financial analysis and so on.

143
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,969
And we can characterize these
different types of roles,

144
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,220
these different types of activities.

145
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,700
We can put them into levels.

146
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,219
Well, as folks were network
enabling these capabilities

147
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,950
after 1989, what they
found was that this model

148
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,880
for organizing your industrial systems

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,710
is actually a decent model
for organizing your security

150
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,380
around these industrial systems.

151
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,780
First off, that the different layers

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,520
tend to render themselves well

153
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,799
to some measure of
isolation and segregation,

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,010
that okay, for example,
level one basic control

155
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,320
while I've got basic control
across all of my systems.

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
So I can do that as a level
of network conductivity.

157
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,920
Level two, area supervisory control.

158
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
I can make that a layer of conductivity.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,810
So the whole model lends itself well

160
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,950
to the way we tend to stray it

161
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:13,190
and wanna segregate things
on a networking level.

162
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,530
Perhaps the most important
thing that engineers discovered

163
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,489
is as they were employing this model,

164
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,340
is that that demilitarized
zone between levels three

165
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,310
and four, in this figure,
it's shown as the yellow box,

166
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,900
that segregation is key.

167
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,950
That on the bottom side of
that level zero through three

168
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,260
these are the industrial systems,

169
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,469
these are the mechanical systems.

170
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,680
This is on the plant floor
or in a clinical environment,

171
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,150
this is inside the hospital.

172
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,530
Whereas on the other hand,
level four and level five

173
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,719
these are more the information systems

174
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,680
where we're taking an analyze data,

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,470
we're doing planning,
we're doing logistics,

176
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,760
we're using computer terminals.

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,770
And so those are systems

178
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,630
that tend to be more computer-oriented

179
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,230
whereas level zero through
three tend to be the levels

180
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,080
that are more industrial-oriented

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,969
and placing a demilitarized zone

182
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,420
or some level of
segregation between the two,

183
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,040
makes a lot of logical sense.

184
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,890
And in many of the
environments that we work with,

185
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,510
that DMZ is the primary defensive layer

186
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,039
around the industrial networks.

187
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,100
And in fact, zero through three,

188
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,510
that's what they call their OT Network

189
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,210
or their plant network or
their hospital network.

190
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,200
And then level four and five,
they call that the IT network.

191
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,900
Now, part of the challenge here is that

192
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,840
up until quite recently,
the industrial network

193
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,929
was really owned by the industrial folks.

194
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,440
That it might be under the
custody of the plant manager

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,990
or the plant engineer,
whereas level four, level five

196
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,900
that would be your IT network,
the purview of the CSO.

197
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,810
And you age old challenge
with organization

198
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,750
that you've got a CSO who
maybe doesn't know much

199
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,570
about plant operations

200
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,170
and who isn't really paying much attention

201
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,750
to what's going on on the
industrial side of the house.

202
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,090
And then you've got plant engineers

203
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,630
who aren't really a cybersecurity folks

204
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,260
who aren't really paying much attention

205
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,970
to what's going on the
cyber side of the house.

206
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,640
And the trend that we're
looking at right now is that,

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,010
that segregation which
has worked pretty well

208
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,203
for the last 20 years,

209
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,980
but that model is starting to show its age

210
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,880
and it's starting to have some issues.

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,199
So let's dive in.

212
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,103
The other aspect of this is
increasing network complexity.

213
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,589
And I mentioned earlier that this idea

214
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,960
that your OT Networks today have got

215
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,504
10 times as much connectivity,

216
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:32,050
100 times as much computing capacity.

217
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,199
For a lot of organizations

218
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,910
that may even be an understatement

219
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,959
if we look at some of
the modern technology

220
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,810
that's out there.

221
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:41,070
And then the other aspect of that,

222
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,220
I mean I can replace a
20-year-old PC with modern PC

223
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,140
and get 10 times as
much computing capacity.

224
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,830
But the other thing is we
got 10 times as many widgets

225
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,810
that cameras have become vastly
cheaper and more accessible.

226
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,859
Folks are realizing the
value of having a camera

227
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,180
pointed at that machine

228
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,400
so that when the machine starts activating

229
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,360
then you start getting
a warning light on it,

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,670
you can look and go, "Oh,
the machine smoking."

231
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,089
That type of visibility
really helps a lot.

232
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,710
And particularly when we're
trying to control staffing,

233
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,770
perhaps we've got lights out facilities,

234
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,270
perhaps it's a sterile facility.

235
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,250
We don't want a lot of people in there

236
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,770
for sanitation purposes,
particularly recently

237
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,110
that having this type
of remote connectivity

238
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,420
becomes very valuable.

239
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,680
And so all of this, when
we combine it together

240
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,949
has dramatically increased
the number of devices,

241
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,920
it's dramatically increased
the amount of conductivity

242
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,990
and Oh, by the way, this same trend

243
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,300
is happening on the IT side.

244
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,219
So not only are our OT Networks
getting more complicated,

245
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,990
our it networks are getting
more complicated as well.

246
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,990
On the OT side, we also add in things

247
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,990
like embedded operating
systems and cross connections.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,040
What does that mean?

249
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,910
Embedded operating
systems that I can get...

250
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,296
Well, 10 years ago, I'd be talking about,

251
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,697
"Hey, I can get an Android device for $500

252
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,020
and I can network connected it."

253
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,817
Well, nowadays today I can
get a Raspberry Pi for $100

254
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,580
and I can network connect
it, or even less than that.

255
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,880
So we've got a lot more devices
that are running full blown,

256
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,120
multitasking, multi
threaded operating systems

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,490
and they've got all the complexity

258
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,930
of those operating systems
and also all the vulnerability

259
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,380
of those operating systems,

260
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,710
particularly compared to kind of

261
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,690
your dedicated network connected devices

262
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,150
that we may have had in the past.

263
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,189
Another factor this is that
now we've got more data.

264
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,310
Now we've got a lot more business drivers

265
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,650
that are asking us for
conductivity across to IT.

266
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,370
That look, I'm collecting
all this camera data,

267
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,230
this is great, but I
want my remote workers

268
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,520
on the IT network to be
able to access the cameras

269
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,400
on the plant floor to be
able to see what's going on

270
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,590
when it's not their shift.

271
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,110
Okay, great. Now I've
got to pump that data.

272
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,110
And then on OT Network and
this can be gigabyte today,

273
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,470
it can be terabyte today

274
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,625
and now I've got to get
it over to the IT side.

275
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,710
Conversely, I've also got
a lot more back and forth

276
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,330
on the IP side of look, I'd
like to be able to control this

277
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,240
on the OT Network.

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,120
And I know it's OT, but again,

279
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,070
the conductivity becomes very useful.

280
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,690
And one of the arguments that I use

281
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,020
when I work with folks on this

282
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,189
is that the business
driver for connectivity,

283
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,130
tends to be so overwhelming
that you're the cost savings

284
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,770
or the value or the synergy

285
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,810
that you're gonna get
from that conductivity,

286
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,839
you can hold it at bay for a little bit,

287
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,950
but you're not gonna win that battle.

288
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,300
That this information wants to be free,

289
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,790
information wants to be shared,

290
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,880
information wants to be exchanged.

291
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,170
And that's what makes that
information valuable and useful.

292
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,120
Having it prepped on the OT environment,

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,450
it's not generating
value for your business

294
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,960
or it's not generating as
much value as it could be

295
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,240
if it were being shared in all
the logical ways it could be.

296
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,330
And that then leads into the same thing

297
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,560
then becomes true with your vendors.

298
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,359
We're seeing vendors
of industrial equipment

299
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,950
who are requiring that as part
of installing that equipment

300
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,720
into this environment that
you are providing connectivity

301
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,550
back to that vendor so that that equipment

302
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,030
can generate diagnostics and
analytics back to the vendors

303
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,160
so that they can provide their support.

304
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,510
You call them up with a problem,

305
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,347
they wanna be able to get
on a terminal and say,

306
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:17,470
"Well, look, that system
reported into me 30 seconds ago,

307
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,010
and it's showing nominal,

308
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,660
why are you telling me there's an error?"

309
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,500
They wanna be able to have that data

310
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,470
so that they can work that out

311
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,860
because it allows them to
provide better support to you,

312
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,710
faster and cheaper.

313
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,970
That's just the reality of it.

314
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,960
From that, we're then seeing
drivers for increased levels

315
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,230
of data collection on your OT Networks.

316
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,110
And a lot of times we're
seeing cloud technology

317
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,280
being used to achieve that.

318
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,839
And so we're seeing private cloud.

319
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
Sometimes it's, you're bringing VMware

320
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,660
into your OT environment,
your OT data center.

321
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,850
It could be that you're bringing
in hybrid cloud technology

322
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,770
like Nutanix, that I can
do a stack of those boxes

323
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,069
and walah, I've got an
instant mini data center

324
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,170
for my OT environment
with gigabytes, terabytes,

325
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,520
sometimes even petabytes of
storage on an OT Network.

326
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,829
And then from that, what
are we also seeing is

327
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,183
is we're seeing data lakes.

328
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,070
And there are a couple of big patterns

329
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,980
we're seeing in data lakes.

330
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,970
One of them is kind of on-prem

331
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,570
where folks are bringing just
a lot of computing capacity

332
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,240
into the OT environment.

333
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,610
The other trend that we're seeing

334
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,480
is that folks are are providing
kind of minimal capacity

335
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,390
in the OT environment.

336
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,500
so the OT environment
can operate correctly,

337
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,820
but then connecting outbound to data lakes

338
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,990
that are in Azure, AWS, Google,

339
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,800
or other vendor private clouds,

340
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,329
and then they're doing advanced analytics

341
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,570
in those environments.

342
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,330
So this is the conductivity
trend that we're seeing,

343
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,570
the pattern that we're seeing increasing

344
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,313
all of these IT capabilities
that are on OT networks.

345
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,449
This conversation wouldn't be complete

346
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,860
if we didn't talk about Raspberry Pi.

347
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,140
And not that that I'm
a huge Raspberry Pi fan

348
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,810
or anything along those lines,

349
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,390
but if you haven't been paying attention,

350
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,430
this sucker popped up on the
radar a couple of years ago

351
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,569
and it's now sneaking in everywhere.

352
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,880
This is a device, it's
three inches by two inches

353
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,170
in dimensions.

354
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,250
It's tiny, and it's a full blown computer.

355
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,690
And I mean, you can get the bottom

356
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,830
of the line version of these
for $35 (clears throat).

357
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,313
And there are a couple of things

358
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,340
that are really significant about.

359
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,710
First off is, it's a full blown computer.

360
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,000
It can run Linux.

361
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,300
Some folks have even hacked
windows to work on this thing.

362
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,569
It can run a full operating system,

363
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,430
it's got full computing capacity.

364
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,262
But then the other thing

365
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,510
that makes it really, really powerful

366
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,130
is this a general purpose
IO header, the GPIO header.

367
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,920
And it's actually that roll of pins

368
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,790
along the top row of the figure,

369
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,650
if you're looking at the figure

370
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,699
and those pins can be
programmed in software

371
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,630
to send signals to actuators
also to collect signals

372
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:01,510
from sensors, and it's
completely general purpose.

373
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,000
So you can write anything
you want to this.

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,760
So we've got Raspberry Pis
that are controlling signs.

375
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,920
We've got Raspberry Pis that
are controlling temperature

376
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,709
sensors, that are controlling
industrial equipment.

377
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,710
Generally, it's non-critical
'cause these aren't exactly

378
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,760
industrial grade reliability machines,

379
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,630
but for kind of secondary and
less critical applications,

380
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,560
this is one of the
fastest and cheapest ways

381
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,627
that you can improvise
on an industrial network

382
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:35,319
and that you can build pretty
much anything you want to

383
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,153
in an industrial environment.

384
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,060
And so we are seeing
these things popping up

385
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
like hotcakes in industrial environments

386
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,380
that folks will get a camera

387
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,530
and, "Oh, let me get the storage
option with that camera."

388
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,839
Well, guess what, instead
of a plastic housing

389
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,783
the vendor's slapped a Raspberry Pi.

390
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,130
And so this is one of the
patterns we're seeing.

391
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,680
And so you should expect
you're gonna see these things

392
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,660
on your OT environments

393
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,160
or you're gonna see industrial equipment

394
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,380
with equivalent levels of capability.

395
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,520
And the fact that we can
do this, this cheaply,

396
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,990
it is a game changer for the industry.

397
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,760
This is replacing components

398
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,069
that when you build them
as industrial components

399
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,149
that could be a thousand
dollars, could be $10,000.

400
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,790
And now we've just
replaced that functionality

401
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,920
with something that is really dirt cheap

402
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,040
and very it's easy to
deploy, it's easy to upgrade,

403
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,917
it's relatively flexible and it shifts

404
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:34,917
a lot of your engineering
that used to be in hardware

405
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,900
or doing dedicated Asics
or dedicated logic chips,

406
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,280
you just do it on a Raspberry Pi instead.

407
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,240
And so this is something that's coming.

408
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,800
If you haven't seen this neuro
team environments already,

409
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,100
keep your eyes peeled, you likely will.

410
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,966
And of course the is,

411
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:53,590
is that it's running off
the shelf operating systems.

412
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,580
It's got similar vulnerabilities,

413
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,129
it's got similar patching requirements.

414
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,700
Maintaining these devices
in an embedded environment

415
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,100
can be tricky and they
aren't incredibly powerful

416
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,933
what they can do

417
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:08,640
that it may just be driving
a temperature sensor.

418
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,190
But the fact is is that
you've got a device there

419
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,000
that if it were compromised,

420
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,040
if it were under control of the attacker,

421
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,730
they could run a full cyber attack suite

422
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,783
off of that temperature sensor.

423
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,760
And this can have a significant impact

424
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,343
in your overall cyber posture.

425
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,810
And so to sum this up

426
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,000
and to kind of bring
these factors together

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,609
and obviously, I'm just talking
about the highlights here

428
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:36,570
(clears throat) we've got
seven major transformations

429
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,889
that we are seeing.

430
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,630
Increasing numbers of OT devices.

431
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,560
A lot more devices on your OT Network.

432
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,629
More of those devices are
either fully networked

433
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,510
or are network capable.

434
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,640
More of those devices also are smarter

435
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,610
and running things such as
full blown operating systems

436
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,129
like Raspberry Pi or similar.

437
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,260
A lot more external connectivity,

438
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,480
a lot more requirements
for external connectivity,

439
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,490
both across your IT side,
as well as to your vendors,

440
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,900
to your partners, to
your equipment providers,

441
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,130
to your support providers.

442
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,060
It just goes on and on the
connectivity requirements.

443
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,550
From that we're now seeing
trends towards cloud technology

444
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,250
coming into OT environments,
private OT clouds.

445
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,140
And then we're also seeing
more advanced OT applications

446
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,110
including analytics and
a lot more data analysis

447
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,270
and including some machine learning

448
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,790
and artificial intelligence
coming into OT environments.

449
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,010
And there's a lot of value to this

450
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,720
that if it can allow you to
predict when that $25,000

451
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,220
piece of equipment needs service

452
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,200
or is prone to failure
or is being overstressed,

453
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
that is incredibly valuable information.

454
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,270
And it's through this
advanced connectivity

455
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,230
and additional technology
on your OT environments

456
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,300
that you're getting this,

457
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,419
but all of this now is
driving the OT environment

458
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,480
as an attack vector.

459
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,860
And so we're seeing an
increased cyber attacks

460
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,199
that are targeting these devices.

461
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,500
And because of this, the
Purdue Model on its own

462
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,583
may not be enough.

463
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,939
And so consequently,

464
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,860
it's time for a bit of a paradigm shift.

465
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,399
And so we've got to start
bringing more IT techniques

466
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,670
into our OT cyber defense.

467
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,580
And in how are we gonna achieve this?

468
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,220
There are eight major areas
that I'm gonna look at.

469
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,810
Obviously, in the interest of times,

470
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,790
I'm only gonna be able to
touch on these briefly,

471
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,120
but I wanna give you a taste

472
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,699
of some of the things you
should be thinking about

473
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,400
and some of the opportunities
that you may have

474
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,333
to improve your OT cyber security.

475
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,570
First off, converging IT and OT.

476
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,090
And this is perhaps
the most important idea

477
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,929
in this and the impact it
has on your organization,

478
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,300
and that is OT and IT
security are converging.

479
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,200
The technologies are converging.

480
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
The separation that we have
had for the last 20 years

481
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,840
separated by that DMZ network
isolation, it is eroding.

482
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,780
And the reality here is that
the OT folks need the IT folks,

483
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,560
the IT cyber folks to help them understand

484
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,950
how to protect all of
the additional technology

485
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,440
that's in the OT environments.

486
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,270
And similarly, the IT
folks need the OT folks

487
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,610
to understand how your OT environment

488
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,270
is different from your II environment

489
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,570
and how you need to be
protecting that OT environment,

490
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,439
a little bit using some
of the same techniques,

491
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,710
but also some different techniques
from what you're used to

492
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,307
and what you're used to in
doing IT cyber security.

493
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:23,340
And I'm gonna assume that many
of the folks on the line here

494
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,060
are our IT cyber folks.

495
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,730
I'm certainly hoping I've got
some OT cyber folks as well.

496
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,563
Well guess what,

497
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,580
if you guys haven't been
talking to each other,

498
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,810
now's a good time to start

499
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,620
because I expect you're
gonna be working together

500
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,969
very closely in the decade to come.

501
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,720
With that, we've got a new model,

502
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,160
and this is another
very important headline

503
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,610
for everybody to be aware of,
and that is hot off the press,

504
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,209
the MITRE team has a
unveiled an ATT&CK framework

505
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,410
for industrial control systems.

506
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,220
Brand new, I think it was
February of this year it came out,

507
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,540
and it contains 11 categories
for characterizing the phases

508
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,379
and the steps and the
methods and the techniques

509
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,730
for conducting OT, cyber attacks.

510
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,560
So I liken this that this
is your periodic table

511
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
for OT cyber.

512
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,820
And it lays out what the
phases of an OT attack

513
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,950
might look like and it lays
out for each of those phases,

514
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,330
what are some of the techniques

515
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,040
that attackers might be using.

516
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,960
And so we've been using
the the ATT&CK framework

517
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,740
on the IT side for quite some time

518
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,100
to help with standardizing cyber defense

519
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,730
and doing automation of that cyber defense

520
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,210
and also data interchange,
coordination of personnel,

521
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,840
coordination of technology.

522
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,280
Well, guess what, now
with the OT framework

523
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,490
we can do some of the same
things in the OT environment

524
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,620
and perhaps with a little
bit less improvisation

525
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,530
than we would have had in the past

526
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,960
or that we had in the past

527
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,620
trying to adapt the standard
ATT&CK framework over to OT.

528
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
So think of this as your periodic table

529
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,392
for analyzing these attacks.

530
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,840
From this, perhaps the
biggest trend we're seeing

531
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,699
is zero trust.

532
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,610
And I use zero trust with, I don't know,

533
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,790
a little bit tongue in
cheek 'cause I'm afraid

534
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,379
it's got an overused in
industry a little bit lately,

535
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,620
but this idea of let's start
locking down our environments.

536
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,979
And at that point, at least
I think is a very good one.

537
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,360
OT environments tend to be
kind of hard and crunchy

538
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,889
on the outside, soft
and chewy on the inside

539
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,210
with a lot of trust and a lot of ability

540
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,740
to move within the environment

541
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,250
once you get onto the OT Network,

542
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,860
that definitely needs to change

543
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,649
and we need to start locking things down.

544
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,130
We need to start introducing
additional security

545
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,240
capabilities, whether
it's at the network layer

546
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,260
things like network access
control, network segmentation,

547
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,170
sub-segmentation within your Purdue Model.

548
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,420
Authentication is a big one.

549
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,550
We're definitely seeing a
majority of our industrial clients

550
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,340
are deploying authentication
within their OT environments.

551
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,347
And a lot of folks are like,

552
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,570
"Oh yeah, I have authentication already.

553
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,460
I've got this a windows
domain controller we deployed

554
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,060
in 2003 and it's still
running after 17 years."

555
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,590
Yeah. You might wanna update that.

556
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,149
Might be time to do some patching,

557
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,350
might be time to do a
little bit of refresh.

558
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,190
It's definitely time to frankly,

559
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,570
assume that you've got
attackers on the OT environment

560
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,710
and start upgrading things accordingly.

561
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,450
Same way as we've been doing
in the IT side for awhile.

562
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,610
The key thing, and perhaps
the big mistake that I see

563
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,229
in zero trust is folks who
kind of the pendulum swings

564
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,590
the other way and they want
to lock everything down.

565
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,820
I've dealt with a lot of OT environment...

566
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,800
Not OT environments,

567
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,810
a lot of zero trust environments

568
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,169
where doing things is extremely difficult

569
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,900
because you spend more times
on permission management

570
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,840
than you do actually, doing whatever it is

571
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
you're trying to do.

572
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,140
So I guess I would discourage folks

573
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,000
from perhaps going that
far down that rabbit hole.

574
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,660
But what I do encourage
is try to pick a subset

575
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,820
of the overall zero trust architecture.

576
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,840
Maybe some basic authentication,

577
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,020
maybe some network segmentation
or some access control,

578
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,810
maybe some monitoring, and
then deploy that subset

579
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,050
so that you have a
reasonable level of security.

580
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,889
And the other thing is that

581
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,060
it doesn't have to be all prevention.

582
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,610
You can get a lot out of detection,

583
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,443
and that's something I'm gonna talk

584
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,570
about a little bit in a second,

585
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,010
but definitely consider
the zero trust framework.

586
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,810
Consider it an overall architecture

587
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,800
for securing your environment.

588
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,763
And then select a subset
that really works for you.

589
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
And then from that as
a part of that subset

590
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,150
I do expect you're gonna
be deploying identity

591
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,283
and access management.

592
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:37,530
And we've seen a huge
uptick in IAM demand,

593
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,670
not just on the OT side,
but on the IT side as well,

594
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,280
over the past several years

595
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,970
and cloud is driving this,
remote work is driving this,

596
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,840
consumer identity is driving this.

597
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,480
There are a lot of drivers going on

598
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,150
with identity and access management.

599
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,920
It is definitely a hot topic today,

600
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,340
and I probably spend
more time on IAM issues

601
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,493
than I do on any other
cybersecurity issue.

602
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,470
And the reality is, and
what I encourage folks

603
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,510
is to look at the same
or similar IAM models

604
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,740
for your OT environment
compared to what you're doing

605
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,790
on your IT environment.

606
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,440
And one model that we've
had some success with

607
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,860
is actually treating IAM as
a service, maybe internally,

608
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,639
maybe even you're gonna
an outside IAM vendor,

609
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,280
but then treating that as a shared service

610
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,180
with shared identity services

611
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,130
being delivered into your OT environment

612
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,420
as well as into your IT environment.

613
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,640
And what does that mean?

614
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,570
It means frankly, you've
got the same credentials

615
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,270
in your OT environment that
you do in the IT environment

616
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,270
and the same logins.

617
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,629
It means that you can do access
control in a single place,

618
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,150
business roles can be
handled in the same place,

619
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,150
multi-factor authentication
can be a shared service.

620
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,050
There are a lot of advantages
to that simplicity,

621
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,879
but the one note of
caution in that approach

622
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,410
is you still have got to
design your OT Network

623
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,710
so that it's gonna fail safe.

624
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,050
One of the challenges that we have with OT

625
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,990
is that in an IT environment,
if a critical security service

626
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,250
goes down and folks are locked
out of the IT environment

627
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,060
frequently, well I wouldn't
say that's acceptable,

628
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,399
but that doesn't tend to result in safety

629
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,750
or a dangerous situation, in
an OT environment that can.

630
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,200
And so one of the challenges

631
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
in adapting some of these shared services

632
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,920
or in bringing IAM as a service
into your OT environment

633
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,750
is going to be shaping it
so that it's going fail safe

634
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,280
or that you've got appropriate
safeguards in place

635
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,490
that if you have an outage
of some of these components

636
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,900
or you've got a WAN outage

637
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,840
or you've got a limited network failure

638
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,149
that your OT environment
is going to degrade

639
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,730
in a manner that is still safe.

640
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,980
And it also meets kind of

641
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:41,090
your safety and regulatory requirements

642
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,199
for protecting your people,
protecting your property

643
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,830
and protecting that environment.

644
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,047
So definitely some
challenges in doing that

645
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,850
and you've got to consider those,

646
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,379
but certainly don't let that dissuade you

647
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,790
from bringing IAM capabilities in the OT.

648
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,639
It's most likely gonna be a must-do

649
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,190
if you haven't done it already.

650
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,820
And then from that, the other
side of your cyber defense

651
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,689
or enhancing your cyber-defense in OT,

652
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,850
there's gonna be monitoring.

653
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,219
And this is really your ace in the hole

654
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,110
in trying to establish
that zero trust framework

655
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,479
or established that increased
cyber defense within OT

656
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,380
without shooting yourself in the foot.

657
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:24,852
And I harp on this with folks
monitor, monitor, monitor,

658
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:29,440
and my one, two, three
for doing monitoring

659
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,020
is start number one, and
this is just coming from

660
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,340
classic risk management methodology,

661
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,530
assets, threats vulnerabilities.

662
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,330
Let's start with what are our OT assets?

663
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,750
What are the threat actors

664
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,080
who are gonna target those assets?

665
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,010
What are they trying to do?

666
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,440
Where are they coming from?

667
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,770
What are they gonna do?

668
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,800
What's the impact of their attack?

669
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,090
How's it gonna affect my environment?

670
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,679
And let me look at that,
let me think about that.

671
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,150
And the cool thing is that

672
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,700
a lot of these potential
cyber threat actions

673
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,709
are also similar to just operational risks

674
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,040
that equipment failure,
people making mistakes,

675
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,500
accidents occurring, natural disasters,

676
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,210
a lot of those are going to trigger

677
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,900
some of the same challenges
in your OT environment

678
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,660
that a cyber attacker might.

679
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,130
And so frequently you can
do cyber attack monitoring

680
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,370
in conjunction with operational monitoring

681
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:26,120
and even detect off some of
the same potential sensors.

682
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,379
So that's kind of part number one.

683
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,383
Part number two is designing
that monitoring approach.

684
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,900
Where we wanna watch in
order to be able to catch

685
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,270
potential attacker activity.

686
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,960
And we've got a couple
of highlights in the box,

687
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,380
privilege activity,

688
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,280
privileged accounts on
your OT environment.

689
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,500
Yes, that's the thing.

690
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,890
Folks you're doing privilege
access management in OT.

691
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,490
Changes, unauthorized changes.

692
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,430
Again, this becomes a safety

693
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,680
and configuration management thing anyway,

694
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,080
but it's also a cyber thing.

695
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,510
Indicators of compromise.

696
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,490
And sometimes I'm gonna be
bringing over the same IOCs

697
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,460
that I use on my IT network.

698
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,590
Other times, these are gonna
be indicators of compromise

699
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,080
that are OT, specific.

700
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,100
Attacker tools.

701
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,639
Frequently, if I have an attacker

702
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,430
who's targeting an OT environment,

703
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,090
they're gonna bring the same tool set

704
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,270
into that OT environment that they would

705
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,510
if they were targeting me on my IP side.

706
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,640
And so the detections I can put in place

707
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,710
to detect those tools and their activity,

708
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,010
exact same sensors, I can reuse
them on the OT side as well.

709
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,690
And then similarly, attacker techniques

710
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,970
they're gonna get into the environment.

711
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,050
Guess what? They're gonna do port scans.

712
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,930
Guess what? They're gonna
target your privilege accounts.

713
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,290
They're gonna target your infrastructure.

714
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,639
So a lot of the same
behaviors that we look for

715
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,820
on the IT side, we can
look for on the OT side

716
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,860
and bringing those over is
not gonna be very difficult

717
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,909
or it shouldn't be very difficult.

718
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,640
And all of that leads to kind
of the third column here,

719
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,910
those monitoring goals.

720
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,410
And we can use these goals

721
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,760
not just to potentially
detect cyber attackers,

722
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,550
but also secondary impacts.

723
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,149
It can support us in asset discovery,

724
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,980
it can support us in
vulnerability management,

725
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,160
it can support us in policy compliance,

726
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,090
road to device detection,
and the list goes on.

727
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,030
So there are all sorts of
things we can accomplish

728
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,020
with our monitoring.

729
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,310
Not all of them are
directly cyber related.

730
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,620
A lot of them are gonna support us

731
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,360
in other business ways as well.

732
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,590
So a lot of power we can get out of this,

733
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,560
if we can put a robust
monitoring framework in place.

734
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,340
And then from that, if we've
got robust monitoring in place

735
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,240
we can start doing security orchestration.

736
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,650
We can start doing security automation.

737
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,450
One of the big things
that I work with folks on

738
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,480
is predicting what's coming in cyber

739
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,190
and in my mind, the scariest scenario

740
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,060
that I worry about is fully
automated cyber attacks.

741
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,500
We have seen glimpses of them.

742
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,560
We've seen partially automated attacks.

743
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,740
Fully automated attacks are coming

744
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,950
and when they get here in my mind,

745
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,180
the only thoroughly effective defense

746
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,340
is gonna be fully automated response.

747
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,419
And to do that, we're
going to have to have

748
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,800
automated secure security orchestration.

749
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,860
This technology is relatively new.

750
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,340
It's still relatively immature.

751
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,459
Doing this today on your
own team environment

752
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,050
is still gonna be relatively difficult.

753
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,899
I would encourage you
to lay the groundwork.

754
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,490
Maybe you pick some
basic SOAR capabilities

755
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,490
to implement sooner rather than later,

756
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,930
but definitely don't get ahead of yourself

757
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,620
because it can become a rat hole

758
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,429
that's very labor
intensive, it's very flaky,

759
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,700
it's very noisy, but definitely
perhaps as you're doing this

760
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,840
on your It side, deploy a
subset of those capabilities

761
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,149
to your OT side

762
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,110
so that you can at least get
some level of a rapid response.

763
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,929
Another aspect to this

764
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,830
is PLA and PLC configuration control.

765
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,720
You'd have a hard left turn.

766
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,730
This is something that
you don't see typically

767
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,740
on your IT environment.

768
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,910
These are OT specific technologies

769
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,929
and it's really cool stuff
when you dig into it,

770
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,320
but it's also very specialized technology.

771
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,153
Well guess what?

772
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:56,310
When somebody blows away
one of those configs

773
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,440
fixing it can be really hard.

774
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,420
And we've seen situations where
PLA configurations got lost

775
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,180
and they had to bring
the manufacturer back in

776
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,520
or they actually had to replace equipment

777
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,450
because they didn't have
the original configs

778
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,900
or it was 20 years old

779
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,962
and the person who knew
it was long since gone.

780
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:15,900
And the thing is, if I
really want to screw with you

781
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,107
as a cyber attacker, I'm
gonna target your PLS and PLCs

782
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:20,740
and I'm gonna try to blow them away.

783
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,260
And frequently, these systems
are not that well protected

784
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,160
unless they're relatively new.

785
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,750
And so getting onto them

786
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,050
getting access, administrative access

787
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,960
and being able to change
some of these configurations

788
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,770
if they're network connected,
it can be relatively easy.

789
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,900
So this is definitely an area.

790
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,190
I encourage you to give this attention

791
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,340
because this is the one

792
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,879
that really could make your life difficult

793
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,120
in the event of a cyber attack

794
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,770
against your OT environment,
because it's very specialized.

795
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,210
It's very different, and
it's very hard to fix

796
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,800
if things go wrong.

797
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,220
Final piece, looking at secure
OT clouds and data lakes.

798
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,960
I talked about this a
little bit earlier on.

799
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,940
It's definitely coming,

800
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,700
and there are a couple of
aspects to doing this securely.

801
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,110
Number one is first off,

802
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,960
having that infrastructure,
that cloud infrastructure

803
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,050
in a secure posture and one technique

804
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,870
is by having it all directly aligned

805
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,500
with your demilitarized zone

806
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,010
or further segmented within
kind of your level zero to three

807
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,190
OT environment, things along those lines,

808
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,860
you don't want high capacity
compute infrastructure

809
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,360
just sitting on your OT
environment unprotected.

810
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,590
You definitely want
additional layers around it.

811
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,130
The other aspect of this, and
you can see it in the figure,

812
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,909
is extension to third parties.

813
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,639
And we talked a little
bit about that earlier on.

814
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,679
It's definitely happening,

815
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,460
and it's happening at all
levels of the produce act.

816
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,929
And one of the big
things that we recommend

817
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,120
to folks who are doing this is

818
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,870
is to be careful that your
third party conductivity

819
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,170
it's not inherently bad.

820
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,690
I mean, certainly it adds risk,

821
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,180
but be careful that you make
that connectivity directly

822
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,490
aligned to your produced acts.

823
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,049
So you're doing level zero conductivity

824
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,430
to a third party will
that needs to be isolated

825
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,129
at level zero from your level
zero to their level zero,

826
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,603
and not then crossing over into level one.

827
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,600
Similarly, your level four connectivity

828
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,670
with your third party, that
needs to be your level four

829
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,870
to their level four with isolation there.

830
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,640
And you wanna try to do that isolation

831
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,480
at the perimeter level.

832
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,213
You also wanna try to do it internally

833
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:24,750
with some level of segmentation
inside of your environment.

834
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,790
And so this way, this allows
us to extend our OT environment

835
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,410
out to our partners, out to our vendors,

836
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,839
out to our providers and et
cetera, but we want to do so

837
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,210
in a way that we're not
our Purdue model back home.

838
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,210
And that's a very important
point as you're doing this,

839
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,700
also as you're deploying compute capacity

840
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,250
or as your industrial
environment is leveraging

841
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,080
compute capacity that perhaps
is coming from elsewhere.

842
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,110
And so to bring all of this together

843
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,013
here's our vision of the
OT Network of the future.

844
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,060
We're gonna bias towards conductivity.

845
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
We're not gonna try to hold back

846
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,690
on the fact that these
systems wanna be connected.

847
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,530
We're also gonna embrace the Purdue Model

848
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,830
that we've had in place, but
we continue to have in place.

849
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,810
In particular, we're
looking at potentially

850
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,029
adding two additional components to this

851
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,360
or enhancing these components in this.

852
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,160
First of these is your
industrial security DMZ.

853
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,759
We're gonna call this level 3.5.

854
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,480
And one of the things we're gonna do

855
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,510
is we're gonna bring our
additional OT cyber capabilities

856
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,410
into that environment so
that they can be isolated

857
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,759
from our level zero to three,

858
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,870
but then also can deliver services

859
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,259
that are crossing over from
level three into level four

860
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,920
and potentially even back to
the it environment as well.

861
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,340
Similarly, we also have got
a level 4.5, we'll call it

862
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,573
which is a forum for delivering
shared security services.

863
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:46,430
And it could also be used
for shared IT services.

864
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,450
Although I don't like mixing
my IT and my security services,

865
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,750
maybe that's 4.5 and port
4.6 in your environment.

866
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,870
But this idea of going
ahead and segregating those,

867
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,420
we segregate them from the it side,

868
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,980
we segregate them from the OT side

869
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,910
and then we allow them to
deliver services to both sides.

870
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,040
And by doing all this, we
should be able to achieve

871
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,110
some measure of attack containment.

872
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,220
We're also gonna be able to employ sensors

873
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,160
at the network layer or
the application layer

874
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,509
at the user layer at all various layers

875
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,430
so that they can then enable
things like automated response.

876
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,310
And so by putting all of this together

877
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,053
let's take this back home to you.

878
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,330
This month, right now you go home,

879
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,529
look at your OT environment.

880
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,670
If you're on the IT side

881
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,440
and you haven't talked to the OT side,

882
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,150
get together and have a meeting,

883
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,430
and let's look at how is
your OT environment changing,

884
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,210
what's new in your OT environment

885
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,200
and where are things going?

886
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,990
What are your plans
over the next two years

887
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,129
in that OT environment?

888
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,280
'Cause I can almost promise
you, your OT environment

889
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,840
has gotten a lot smarter than you think

890
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,700
over the last 10 years.

891
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,609
And it's gonna get a heck of a lot smarter

892
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,880
over the next 10 years.

893
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
And then finally do some
checks on your OT environment

894
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,450
for indicators of compromise.

895
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,620
Frequently, you're gonna have
the logs on the firewall,

896
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,520
frequently people aren't
looking at those logs.

897
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,353
Well, guess what?

898
00:37:57,353 --> 00:38:00,320
I can turn on my
detective port scan sensor

899
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,020
on my switches and the OT environment,

900
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,670
leave it on for a couple of days and see,

901
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,030
do I have port scans running
in my IOT environment,

902
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,240
check elsewhere in my logs.

903
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,959
There's a lot you can look for

904
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,210
and possibly catch within
your OT environment

905
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,380
that might be signs that
you've got a problem right now,

906
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,930
today and obviously the
sooner you can jump on that

907
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,089
if you do have a problem,

908
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,950
the better it's gonna be for everybody.

909
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,740
This year obviously, we
can't make a hard right turn.

910
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,680
It's already April,

911
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,140
particularly if you're on
an annual budget cycle,

912
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,299
but there are some things we can do.

913
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,480
You most likely can improve your logging

914
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,060
and monitoring and your OT
environment and particularly,

915
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,080
when you look for
indicators of compromise,

916
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,913
you've probably said,

917
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,210
"Gee, it would be nice if
we had that information."

918
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,463
Well, let's turn that
option on and get that.

919
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,290
Start collecting that data, go to ATT&CK.

920
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,000
If you're familiar with ATT$CK for OT

921
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
and you're using it already, great.

922
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,620
If you're not familiar with
it and you're not using it,

923
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,910
I encourage you to study it.

924
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,060
And because that's gonna
give you some great ideas

925
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,480
for detective controls that
are relatively easy, fast

926
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,560
and cheap to start deploying today.

927
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,049
And while we're deploying
that additional detection

928
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,290
in place, we can take
some of the other areas

929
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,279
that I talked about

930
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,210
and start framing out for your environment

931
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,400
what your vision for Next-gen
OT security looks like.

932
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,204
And then once you've got that,

933
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:14,100
and largely that's a staffing exercise,

934
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,080
it's a thought exercise,
it's a coordination exercise.

935
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,400
These are all things we can do

936
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,542
without having to ask for budget,

937
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,850
But once we have that, then
we can start talking budget,

938
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,730
we can start talking resources,
we can talk talking schedule

939
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,530
and that will then position
you so that maybe next year,

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,680
maybe the year after,

941
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,720
certainly over the next couple of years,

942
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,160
you can frame out plans and
you can frame out projects

943
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,810
and resources to continue
enhancing your OT cybersecurity

944
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,460
over time in the years to come.

945
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,980
And with that, that
concludes my presentation.

946
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,080
I'm hoping I've given you some great ideas

947
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,580
and some food for thought

948
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,167
and good luck with your
cyber security challenges

949
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,529
and your OT environment.

950
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,500
And thank you very much.

951
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,447
Have a great day.
