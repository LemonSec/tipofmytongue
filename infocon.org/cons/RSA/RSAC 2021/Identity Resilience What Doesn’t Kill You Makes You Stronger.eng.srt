1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,573
- Hi, my name is Zulfikar Ramzan

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:06,180
and I'm the chief digital officer of RSA.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm excited to talk to you today

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,960
about the idea of identity resilience.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,163
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,709
Now a little bit about my background.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,130
I was born in Africa.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,549
I have South Asian roots.

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,780
I grew up in the US on the East coast.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,120
And for the last couple of decades

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,130
I've lived in California.

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,323
In short, I am a walking identity crisis.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,692
So I can think of no better
topic to discuss with you today

14
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:35,400
than the idea of identity to resilience.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,350
How are we're gonna move forward
in the identity landscape?

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,440
Well, the first thing
I wanna convince you of

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,460
is the idea that in today's society,

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,113
identity is foundational.

19
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,220
And I wanna do that by talking
about the idea of trust.

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,460
So, first of all, if you
think about it for a moment

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,203
our society depends on
trust in a fundamental way.

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,750
Imagine if you will, that this
was an in-person conference.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,850
At some point, we're gonna do those again.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,683
And if it were

25
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,460
then by the time I left my home

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,819
to when I arrived for
the speaking engagement,

27
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,639
at the conference,

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,150
I would have to go through a
number of trust checkpoints

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,370
and make a number of very
large trust assumptions.

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,203
First of all,

31
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:14,320
I may have to trust the driver

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,119
of any public transportation I took.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,479
I'd have to trust the people on the plane,

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,510
the pilot, the staff I engage with,

35
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,970
people at the hotel,
people at the conference,

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,600
the attendees of the session.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
all of them might have to trust

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,140
not to do any form of
malfeasance while I'm there.

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,640
And I have to go through a whole number

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,540
of security checkpoints along the way.

41
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,039
Now, if you think about it for a moment

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,080
what makes us bootstrap trust?

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,289
How do we start to enable

44
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,173
and engender trust despite
all these assumptions?

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,860
Well, I believe identity is core to that.

46
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,980
If you think about it for a moment

47
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,860
whenever we engage any
type of transaction,

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,190
typically what we're doing
is binding our identity

49
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,410
to some type of permission,
some type of allowance.

50
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,030
And that in turn is bound
to some type of institution

51
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,340
that's being used to help
us bootstrap our identity.

52
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,310
For example, imagine that
I'm going to the airport

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,793
and at the TSA checkpoint.

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,100
At that moment in time, I'm
showing maybe a driver's license

55
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,480
or a passport.

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,130
In that case what I'm doing

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,490
is establishing proof of who I am.

58
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,130
In other words, establishing an identity

59
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,240
but I'm tying that identity
to some kind of issuer,

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,140
whether it's the US
Passport Agency or the DMV

61
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,790
that effectively binds my
identity to an institution.

62
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,260
And again, every step of the way,

63
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,870
whether it's at the airport or
checking into the conference

64
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,580
getting my conference badge,
make my way to the session.

65
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,210
Typically I've got to
show my conference badge

66
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,910
at the session to be allowed in,

67
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,510
as a speaker

68
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,799
every step of the way,

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
at some point there's an identity check

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,190
and that identity check

71
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,920
is used to engender some form of trust,

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,280
which then becomes the ultimate fuel

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
for society to move forward.

74
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,250
Now, the challenge with this approach

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,020
is that the way we look at identity today

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,300
is actually quite broken.

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,960
If you think about it for a moment

78
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,410
we have very little agency
over our identities.

79
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,880
Our identities are managed
by centralized institutions

80
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,210
in this world that I just talked about.

81
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,950
Our passports can be revoked.

82
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,899
Our driver's license can be taken away.

83
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,550
In many ways, when we think
about identity in modern society

84
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,040
it doesn't match what
we think about identity

85
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
in terms of at a more fundamental level.

86
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,410
Now, when you look at digital identities,

87
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,270
these problems only become much worse.

88
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,943
They exacerbate, they multiply.

89
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,290
And I think we have a lot we
can do in terms of moving away

90
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,920
from this traditional
centralized model of identity

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,679
into a world where identity can scale

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,593
and be resilient for modern society.

93
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,710
Now you've heard me talk about terms

94
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,670
like centralization being bad
and things of that nature.

95
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,790
If you think that I'm going to talk today

96
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,989
about the idea of blockchain,

97
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,403
let me tell you blockchain
is not the answer.

98
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,250
I think blockchain has applications

99
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,230
in areas like cryptocurrencies,

100
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,480
obviously that was the application

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,530
for which blockchain was first developed.

102
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,930
But aside from these types of applications

103
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,900
I believe that any problem

104
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,770
that people are using blockchain to solve

105
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,310
can be solved more readily by
existing legacy technologies.

106
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,930
In some cases, far more efficiently.

107
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,940
And I think that
blockchain can play a role

108
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,620
in identity management,

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,810
but by no means is it
a required technology.

110
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,642
And in fact,

111
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,072
it's probably not even the best
technology for that purpose.

112
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,940
Instead, I do want to talk about

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,332
a technological idea that
dates back now 40 plus years.

114
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,000
If we go back to 1977, Ron Rivest,

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Adi Shamir and Len Adleman

116
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,310
or as we like to call them, RS&A,

117
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,270
embarked on a quest to
think about this notion

118
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,253
and formalize the idea
of digital identities.

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,050
You can see this picture

120
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,780
taken in 1982 of Rivest,
Shamir and Adleman.

121
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,510
Ron Rivest is in the
middle of this picture

122
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,693
with his plaid shirt.

123
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,120
To your left or to Ron's right

124
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,720
is Adi Shamir with his hipster beard.

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,190
And you've got Len Adleman,
who's on your right

126
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,090
or Ron's left with his
hands in his pocket.

127
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,852
RS&A focusing on this problem.

128
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,300
They in turn were motivated.

129
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,650
They were inspired by some earlier work

130
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,239
by people like Whitfield
Diffy, Marty Hellman

131
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,163
and Ralph Merkle.

132
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,890
On this picture

133
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,570
that you can see on the
left-hand side of the screen,

134
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,390
you've got Marty Hellman in the middle.

135
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,020
Whit Diffy with his long mane
of hair is to Marty's left.

136
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,462
And then Ralph Merkle is to Marty's right.

137
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,820
Together these folks were pioneers

138
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,223
of the modern digital era.

139
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,360
I wanna tell you the story
of how this all came about.

140
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,030
In the mid 1970, Ron
Rivest, was short a paper

141
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,760
by one of his graduate students.

142
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,690
A paper written by Diffy and Hellman

143
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,110
called New Directions in Cryptography.

144
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,310
And this paper posited the idea

145
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,570
of creating secure digital identities,

146
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,853
of enabling the idea of a
digital signature concept.

147
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,810
But the paper couldn't quite figure out

148
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,890
how to make the details work.

149
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,000
How to actually make the
underlying mathematics

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
achieve what they wanted to
achieve in an overall framework.

151
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,360
And so Ron began to embark on
trying to solve this problem

152
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,570
and he enlisted the help of
Adi Shamir and Len Adleman.

153
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,690
The process typically went like this,

154
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,320
Ron or Adi would have an idea

155
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,270
and then when Len,

156
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,400
Len was like the killjoy of the group.

157
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,409
Len was the person who found all the flaws

158
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,370
in everything that Ron
Adi would come up with.

159
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,380
And they would do this
process over and over again.

160
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,980
Ron or Adi coming up with an idea,

161
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,510
Len finding a flaw in it,

162
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,740
and they kept going on and on

163
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,350
until they found themselves at an impasse.

164
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,810
They needed a critical creative ingredient

165
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,280
to help fuel their innovative thinking.

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,830
And they found that ingredient,

167
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,730
alcohol.

168
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,787
Or more specifically, Manischewitz wine.

169
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,880
It's a true story.

170
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,120
One evening there was a Passover dinner

171
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,330
at the home of one of the
graduate students at MIT

172
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,359
and Ron, Adi and Len
were all in attendance.

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,940
A great deal of Manischewitz
wine was consumed that evening.

174
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,980
And Ron went home.

175
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,500
He had trouble falling asleep at night.

176
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,333
And he did what we all do

177
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,480
when we have trouble falling asleep.

178
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,433
He sat on his couch and you
read a mathematics textbook.

179
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,720
If you're really interested,

180
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,763
it was Dixon's Group on Group Theory.

181
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,010
But in particular, while
a book like Dixon's book

182
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,840
on group theory might put us
all to sleep late at night,

183
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,960
for Ron it did actually
quite the opposite.

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,250
For Ron, what was remarkable,

185
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,302
is as he was reading this particular book,

186
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:24,710
he got to a chapter on permutation groups.

187
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,190
And in this chapter, there
were some interesting ideas.

188
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,060
And as Ron was reading this chapter

189
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,970
he kept coming back to that problem

190
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,390
of how to create a
secure, digital signature.

191
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,580
How to actually create the
cryptographic equivalent

192
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,940
of a normal signature that could help bind

193
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,023
a key of some sort to someone's identity.

194
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,570
And along the way,

195
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,700
he came up with a set of insights,

196
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,409
right that evening.

197
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,590
And he spent that entire
evening, that night,

198
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,210
writing up his insights, cleaning them up.

199
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,080
And the next morning he showed
the insights to Len Adleman

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,707
and Len looked at Ron and said,
"Ron, I think you got it."

201
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:06,090
And that was the birth
of the RSA Cryptosystem

202
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,619
and the rise of digital signatures,

203
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,423
which fueled the modern digital era.

204
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,060
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say

205
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,523
that every single one of us,

206
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,493
throughout the day, use this
technology on a regular basis.

207
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,619
Whether you are doing a
searching inquiry on Google

208
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,390
or buying a product from Amazon

209
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,659
or doing a virtual conference session.

210
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,740
This technology underpins
the modern digital society

211
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,490
and the work of people like
Rivest, Shamir and Adleman,

212
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,559
their predecessors, Whitfield
Diffy, Marty Hellman

213
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,209
and Ralph Merkle,

214
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,880
have enabled us to engage
in digital transformation.

215
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,020
They have put the trustworthiness
in digital technology.

216
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,970
It's allowed us to embrace that technology

217
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,083
and use it and build a more
resilient world in the process.

218
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,390
This idea though, was a
beginning of a modern foundation

219
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,939
of digital identity

220
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,810
and specifically look at the problem

221
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,989
of what I think of as identity assurance.

222
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,990
How do I prove that I am who I say I am?

223
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,473
That, to me,

224
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:06,329
is one of the most fundamental
problems in identity.

225
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,480
It's really about
establishing who you are.

226
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,130
Now the work of Rivest, Shamir and Adleman

227
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,950
is really one component of
enabling identity assurance.

228
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,703
And I'll talk about some of the
additional components later.

229
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,590
The second key area I wanna talk about

230
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,630
that builds upon identity assurance,

231
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,053
is access assurance.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,833
What do I know about

233
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,600
what you should be given
access to in the first place?

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,750
Are there critical systems

235
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,730
that you should be given access to,

236
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,860
or maybe you've got the right identity

237
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,810
but somebody gave you the wrong access.

238
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,069
And finally, there's a
notion of activity assurance.

239
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,870
How do I know that you'll
do the right things

240
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,703
with that access?

241
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:43,689
Engage in the right set of activities?

242
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,100
After all, maybe you are the right person.

243
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,120
Maybe you were given the right access

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,990
or perhaps you turned
road became an insider

245
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,660
and did something nefarious
with that activity

246
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,670
or more commonly, maybe you didn't realize

247
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,502
you were doing something

248
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,860
that could cause a lot of
problems down the line.

249
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,590
So these three pillars, identity
assurance, access assurance

250
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,270
and activity assurance

251
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,439
are the three critical pillars

252
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,750
when it comes to managing
modern digital identity

253
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,200
and achieving identity
resilience for the future.

254
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,680
If you think about the way
identities evolve over time

255
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,252
it's evolved along the
lines of these pillars.

256
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,340
In the early days, when organizations

257
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,690
thought about digital identity,

258
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,430
their focus was their employee base.

259
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,510
How do they get their
employees to be able to access

260
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,420
back office applications,

261
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
access critical data

262
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,719
from anywhere in the
world, from any location.

263
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,960
That was a very powerful concept.

264
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,010
It allowed organizations
to enable their employees

265
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,340
to work from anywhere, to be remote

266
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,040
and to do all sorts of wonderful things

267
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,783
that enabled organizations
to thrive and move forward.

268
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,900
As organizations saw the benefits

269
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,560
of enabling this remote workforce,

270
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,329
they began to realize
that the same technologies

271
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,610
that could be used to
enable a remote workforce

272
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,030
could also enable a much more
robust partner ecosystem.

273
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,430
And so they began to enable their partners

274
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,030
with similar capabilities,

275
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,740
giving their partners the
ability to access critical areas.

276
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,090
That led to the rise of
B2B exchanges and protocols

277
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,810
and particular also
markup languages like SAML

278
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,760
the Security Assertion Markup Language.

279
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,490
The next phase was
looking at the same idea

280
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,900
but bringing it to the actual consumer.

281
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,920
Imagine if organizations

282
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,880
could directly deal with their customers

283
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
providing services directly to them

284
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,410
using the digital medium.

285
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,689
That gave rise to the idea of E-commerce.

286
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,670
And as E-commerce has continued

287
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,339
we've now seen a world where
the pendulum is shifted

288
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,853
towards not just people,
but people and things.

289
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,150
The canonical example here

290
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,900
is a world where you
have a smart refrigerator

291
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,199
and a smart refrigerator can detect

292
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,500
that you're out of milk

293
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,303
and place an order on your behalf.

294
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,090
And where this idea gets
interesting from an identity lens

295
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,240
is that all of a sudden you have a thing,

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,270
like an IOT device or a smart fridge

297
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,060
or something of that nature,

298
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,910
making a decision on behalf of a person

299
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,560
and effectively taking action
based on that decision.

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,219
In this case the person has
delegated their authority

301
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,570
to that device.

302
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,110
The device in turn makes a transaction

303
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,930
and the human is never involved anymore.

304
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,780
That takes everything to a new level.

305
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,890
And finally, you've got the modern era

306
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,699
which is really about
building relationships.

307
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,750
Let me talk about that in a simple level.

308
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,400
Think about your vehicle.

309
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,829
Today you have a vehicle

310
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,200
and you effectively have a relationship

311
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,170
with your vehicle as the
owner of that vehicle.

312
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,900
If you can prove that you
are indeed the right owner,

313
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,733
by for example,

314
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:40,770
having an app on your phone

315
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,860
that allows you to open the
vehicle with touch of a button,

316
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,760
you in turn are allowed

317
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,980
to engage in behaviors with that vehicle.

318
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,820
You can drive it somewhere
and so on and so forth.

319
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,900
Now at this point, all I've talked about

320
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,132
is a simple two-person, mini
bi-directional relationship.

321
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,060
You can actually make these
relationships much more complex.

322
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,960
Imagine a world where you are, let's say,

323
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,510
driving to a restaurant

324
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,723
and you wanna give your
vehicle to a valet.

325
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,573
At this point

326
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:09,130
maybe you trust your valet
with driving the vehicle

327
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,580
but you wanna put certain restrictions

328
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,750
on how that vehicle is being driven.

329
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,120
Maybe you want to limit the radius

330
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,910
that the vehicle can go,
the physical distance.

331
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,280
Maybe you wanna limit the number of miles

332
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,370
that the vehicle can drive

333
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,930
or maybe you wanna limit the actual speed

334
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,739
the vehicle can go when
you're not in the vehicle

335
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,760
and it's being given to a valet.

336
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,730
So now here you're talking about
establishing a relationship

337
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,720
delegating authority
but putting restrictions

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,883
around that authority.

339
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
By the way, that's really
tapping the surface,

340
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,579
really tapping or scratching

341
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,800
the surface of the iceberg here.

342
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,300
If you think about it for a moment,

343
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,319
there's a lot more you can do.

344
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,040
Imagine a world where you could

345
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,410
only give you a vehicle to a valet

346
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,870
if you knew for sure that that valet

347
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,830
had not got into a traffic accident

348
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,920
sometime in the last 12 months.

349
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,370
Or that their driver's
license was up to date.

350
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,330
Or imagine you wanna give a
vehicle to a family member.

351
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,490
Let's say you are a parent

352
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,130
and you wanna help your
son drive a vehicle,

353
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,630
your daughter drive a vehicle.

354
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,010
Maybe you will only do it

355
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,010
if you can get an assurance

356
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,930
that their last report
card grade was high enough

357
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,250
before you're gonna give
them access to a vehicle.

358
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,020
Now, when you make more
and more elements digital,

359
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,860
whether it's digital grades,
digital report cards,

360
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,020
getting digital DMV records
and accident records and so on

361
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,760
and these digital pieces can talk together

362
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,840
using technologies like the
RSA algorithm and others

363
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,010
to bind identities with
different transactions,

364
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,960
the possibilities become
limitless in what you can achieve.

365
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,853
I think we're living in a world
today where we can actually

366
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,670
start to achieve a lot of those aims.

367
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,502
Remarkably using technologies

368
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,523
that have been around now for decades.

369
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,030
Let me talk about how
that evolution will work

370
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,180
through the idea of
decentralized identity.

371
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,350
So first and foremost, if you
look at the original world,

372
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,110
the focus was on centralized
identity management.

373
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,160
In that world you had one
identity for organization

374
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,100
and for relationship.

375
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,380
That identity who is controlled
by a central authority.

376
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,570
That central authority
effectively had full sovereignty,

377
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,533
full rights, full agency,
over that identity.

378
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,110
They could revoke it,

379
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,033
they could do whatever they
wanted with it. It was digital

380
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,450
so it was more convenient in some cases

381
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,270
but also didn't really truly
achieve the notion of identity.

382
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,569
Now, by the way, early examples of that

383
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,420
are in the certificate authority model,

384
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,939
introduced in the early papers
on public key cryptography.

385
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,610
RSA was a very early
proponent of that model

386
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,910
and developed a certificate authority

387
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,870
and actually spun it out
as a separate company

388
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,810
that we now call Verisign

389
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,650
and really prompted the idea of E-commerce

390
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,683
using central authorities to
basically manage your PKI.

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,050
But that to me was really the first step.

392
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,180
The next key evolution happened
when people realized that

393
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,410
Hey, the central authority idea

394
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,273
just put too much power in
the hands of one entity.

395
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,153
Wouldn't it be better

396
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,320
if you could have a federated identity,

397
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,940
a situation where that central power

398
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,950
was divided among multiple sites

399
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,930
where you could have
multiple identities linked,

400
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,410
allowing one identity to be
used in multiple locations

401
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,490
thereby creating a great level

402
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,390
of convenience with that one identity.

403
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,570
One of the first examples

404
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,050
of trying to achieve this
federated identity concept

405
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,323
was Microsoft Passport in 1999.

406
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,910
And while the idea was useful

407
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,740
it still actually put
Microsoft at the nexus

408
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,480
of being able to do
all these transactions.

409
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,360
So in some ways, yes you
could use your identity

410
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,770
in more places,

411
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,980
but you were still beholden to one entity

412
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,930
when it came to managing your identity.

413
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,130
A few years later

414
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,780
some microsystems helped
establish something

415
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,189
called the Liberty Alliance

416
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,610
and RSC was an early member of it.

417
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,590
And the Liberty Alliance was
really driven around the idea

418
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,100
of being able to convert this
idea of a monopoly model,

419
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,670
to more of an oligopoly.

420
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,890
Having multiple organizations

421
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,199
get involved in the federated process.

422
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,230
So no one organization
was given all the power

423
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,283
in that process.

424
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:00,170
It was great but still is not
quite where we want it to be.

425
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,839
You still don't have the full level

426
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,843
of agency over your identity.

427
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,400
Now, one place where we started to see

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,369
more agency over identities

429
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,203
comes in the next year,

430
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,403
which is the user centric
epoch in identity management.

431
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,069
Think of technologies like Open ID.

432
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,349
Here you just get to own your identity

433
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,050
but there may be a third
party identity provider,

434
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,992
IDP that mediates the identity.

435
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:28,089
Now in that world, one
identity can be used

436
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,209
to access multiple sites
and multiple services.

437
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,043
One example of that,

438
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:35,770
that was derived from Open
ID is Facebook Connect.

439
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,550
Your single Facebook account could be used

440
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,450
to access multiple services

441
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,800
with just a single username and password.

442
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,520
So on the one hand,

443
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,270
users were able to create
their identity so to speak

444
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,650
and use it in multiple locations,

445
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,130
but we still we're not quite there yet

446
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,637
because ultimately in scenarios like that,

447
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,780
the identity provider

448
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,020
could basically revoke identities at will.

449
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,010
And in some cases, people
woke up one morning

450
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,720
and realized that their
Facebook account was revoked

451
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,400
for reasons they didn't fully understand.

452
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,233
And the issue is

453
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,149
that not only was their
Facebook access now

454
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,800
no longer available

455
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,050
but every site that was
using their Facebook identity

456
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,460
through Facebook Connect

457
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,310
was in turn no longer available

458
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,310
and that's an issue.

459
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,790
And so we come now to the modern era,

460
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,623
which is really about

461
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:24,470
looking at decentralized
identity management.

462
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,730
And in this world, users can
create their own identities.

463
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,730
They can actually obtain and
present verifiable credentials

464
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,690
and verifiable claims
about their identities.

465
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,520
And those claims can
be tied back to sources

466
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,600
that are believed to be trusted

467
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,453
or at least are trustworthy
in one way, shape or form.

468
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,773
And what's really nice about this model

469
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,929
is it's given agency back to the user.

470
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,120
You're really focusing on

471
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,610
identity as a means to access
or achieve some other aim.

472
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,479
And focusing on the idea
of verifiable claims.

473
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,710
Now, one benefit of this approach

474
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,970
is it affords more
privacy to the end user.

475
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,270
In particular, it allows the end user

476
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,310
to only provide the
details that are necessary

477
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,053
for a transaction to take place.

478
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,240
Imagine for a moment, if you will,

479
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,920
that let's say I'm going to the airport

480
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,220
that today when I go to the airport

481
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,620
and talk to the TSA agent,

482
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,060
what I really have to prove to the agent

483
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,893
more than anything else,

484
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,400
is that I am a legitimate
ticket holder for a flight

485
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,320
that is at some point
beyond the check point

486
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,560
where the agent is standing.

487
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,419
That's all the agent really needs to know.

488
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,140
But what I tell the agent
instead is a lot more.

489
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,780
First of all, I give
them my boarding pass.

490
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,830
I hand them my driver's license,

491
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,870
which may contain all sorts
of other information about me.

492
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,939
It has my full name.

493
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,350
It's got my date of birth.

494
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,560
It's got my address.

495
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,520
It has my organ donor status.

496
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,760
It even has a terrible picture of me

497
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,180
that was taken far too many years ago

498
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,230
that I no longer like to even see.

499
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,210
And so, as you can imagine,

500
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,060
I'm sure in all this data

501
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,120
when all I'm trying to do is
achieve one single purpose.

502
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
With the idea of verifiable claims

503
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,270
we can eliminate that and
really focus on sharing

504
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,940
what's actually essential.

505
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
And really focusing on an element first.

506
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,100
And what's remarkable is
that these technologies,

507
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,760
even though they've been
around for a long time,

508
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,440
I believe now is the time
where they'll finally take root

509
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,120
because of a couple of key market drivers

510
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,469
and a couple of broader trends

511
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,930
in the way people think about the world.

512
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,330
Let me highlight those here.

513
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,940
First of all, in today's world,

514
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,370
we have a easy place to store
cryptographic credentials,

515
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,683
namely mobile devices.

516
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,290
If you go back 30 to 40 years ago,

517
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,270
people did not have a
natural place to store

518
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,370
cryptographic key material.

519
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,030
Yes, there was conversation
about ideas like smart cards

520
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,639
and whatnot, but at the end of the day

521
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,590
nobody had a convenient
way that they always had

522
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,770
on their person

523
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,629
to store cryptographic keys.

524
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,410
Now everyone's got a mobile phone.

525
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,250
Mobile phones typically
have secure enclave

526
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,620
where cryptographic key
material can be stored

527
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,800
and the process can be
made much more seamless

528
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,720
much more usable and
much more user-friendly

529
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,943
for the masses.

530
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,450
Second, today we know

531
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,780
we have too many passwords to deal with.

532
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,350
Technologies that use verifiable claims

533
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,062
can help eliminate the need
for a lot of passwords.

534
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,450
Now, if you go back 30 to 40 years ago

535
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,870
people didn't have that many passwords.

536
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,260
There was no pain point, no
itch to scratch, so to speak.

537
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,760
And therefore 30 to 40 years ago,

538
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,530
it was hard to convince somebody

539
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,440
why they should consider adopting
something much more fancy

540
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,150
with digital signatures and public keys

541
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,983
when they could in fact,

542
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,067
simply just use a username and password.

543
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,870
Now security people
understood why usernames

544
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,703
and passwords are bad.

545
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,060
Passwords have low entropy,

546
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,230
they tend to be compromised
easily and so on and so forth.

547
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,920
But for the vast majority
of people out there

548
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,310
that pain point wasn't as evident.

549
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,960
Today, however, we all recognize

550
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,110
that passwords are just
really difficult to deal with.

551
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,729
Most people have hundreds of passwords

552
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,450
across multiple accounts.

553
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,560
I can barely keep track.

554
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,530
I'm sure you can't keep track either.

555
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,310
And so, as a result,

556
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,419
what we're seeing is a world

557
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,150
where that driver has come up repeatedly.

558
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,320
Now by the way, I'd love to ask some

559
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,020
of you in the chat window here.

560
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,840
Tell me how many passwords
you have in general.

561
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,760
How many different accounts
do you have passwords for?

562
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,940
I'd love to get a sense
of where people are today.

563
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,223
I know that I've seen this
number grow over time.

564
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,500
The third key driver has been
in decentralized storage.

565
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,670
I know I've talked about
blockchain and Bitcoin

566
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,080
and things of that nature

567
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,750
and cloud and all these technologies.

568
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,140
They've gotten people used to the idea

569
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,480
that you can have storage out there

570
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,790
handling what's going on, on your behalf.

571
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,670
And it turns out that
decentralized storage

572
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,503
even though we'd known

573
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,879
how to do decentralized
storage for many, many years,

574
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,500
it's become much more acceptable.

575
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,380
And so, as a result,

576
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,890
people out there are
not reluctant to use it.

577
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,170
And they're okay with technologies

578
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,853
that use decentralized storage.

579
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,893
Then finally, privacy.

580
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,540
Go back 30 to 40 years ago,

581
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,840
when people were not as attuned

582
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,439
to the needs of digital privacy.

583
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,320
Today we all recognize, we
see firsthand what happens

584
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
when a handful of organizations

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,250
have our most precious data.

586
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,680
Data that we are sometimes shocked

587
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,630
that they even possess.

588
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,030
Today's world is much more attuned

589
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,330
to the needs of privacy and technologies

590
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,169
like decentralized identity
management capabilities

591
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,240
using verifiable claims

592
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,490
really allow individuals to
minimize what is disclosed

593
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,803
and therefore provide privacy
back to the individual.

594
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,760
Now, so far, I've focused
on one aspect of the world

595
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
which is on identity assurance

596
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,040
and specifically around authentication,

597
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,720
which to me is one component
of identity assurance.

598
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,040
Authentication is about proving

599
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,850
that you are who you say you are

600
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,350
by virtue of possessing

601
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,280
some piece of secret material,
typically a password,

602
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,320
a one-time token, or in this case

603
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,230
a cryptographic key that
can be used to engage

604
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,253
in a transaction.

605
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,220
However, identity assurance

606
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,147
is actually much broader than that.

607
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,110
The basic concept of authentication

608
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,360
involves using proof of
possession to establish identity,

609
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
as I just mentioned.

610
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,100
But real life authentication involves

611
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,983
much more complex processes,
much more context.

612
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,180
And ultimately that context
has to be juxtaposed

613
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,170
together with broader
information about criticality

614
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,010
in terms of what's being accessed

615
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,340
in order to make a intelligent decision

616
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,720
about whether or not

617
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,930
that authentication
procedures should proceed

618
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,490
and you should be allowed to
access that particular service.

619
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,950
Let me give you a bit
of a real world example

620
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,480
of how we think about identity

621
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,240
just in our day-to-day lives

622
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,140
and how we think about identity
assurance in that context.

623
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,210
A few years ago I was in the airport

624
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,100
and I was one through the terminal

625
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,230
and in the distance I saw a person

626
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,750
who I thought was someone
I went to high school with.

627
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,540
Now look, hadn't seen
this person in many years.

628
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,010
I wasn't a hundred percent sure

629
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,500
if it was that person

630
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,950
but I kind of gradually walked up to them

631
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,680
and said, "Hey, Dan, is at you?"

632
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,227
And he looked at me and he said,

633
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:41,060
"Zuli."

634
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,893
And he smiled

635
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:44,730
and I smiled back and we
recognized each other,

636
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,170
even though it had been many years.

637
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,050
Now what we effectively did

638
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,560
is we engaged in some form
of mutual authentication.

639
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,840
We established identities with each other

640
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,080
but at no point did I say, "Hey, Dan

641
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,179
can you please tell me your
driver's license number

642
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,000
or your social security
number or your password."

643
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,150
And likewise, he didn't
do the same for me.

644
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,219
We engaged in a protocol

645
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,330
whereby we looked at a lot of
individual pieces of context

646
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,659
felt that that context met a certain bar,

647
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,850
internally giving us a level of assurance.

648
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,530
And that level of assurance,

649
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,879
in this particular case,

650
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,943
was enough given the risks involved.

651
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,440
Let me give you another example
where this comes up a lot.

652
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,680
Imagine the banking world

653
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,630
and this is something we
know really well at RSA.

654
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,430
Let me give you one remarkable secret.

655
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,510
And maybe some of you don't know,

656
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,920
which is that when you type
your username and password

657
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,303
into your bank's website,

658
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,463
they actually don't care

659
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:36,337
if you typed the right thing in or not.

660
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,940
And the reason they don't care so much

661
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,850
is that they assume
somebody who is not you

662
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,463
already knows your password.

663
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,510
Now, they won't tell you that

664
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,710
because they don't want
you to get scared off

665
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,490
and not sure your password box,

666
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,370
but ultimately they know

667
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,780
that they can't put too
much faith in passwords

668
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,550
as a mechanism for providing
identity assurance.

669
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,200
Instead, what your bank
will typically look at

670
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,210
is a variety of other factors.

671
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,930
What time of day did you log in?

672
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,810
Where did you log in from?

673
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,649
What did you do once you logged in?

674
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,570
What were the characteristics

675
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,740
of the system that was used
when you engage in that login?

676
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,877
What was the browser that you use?

677
00:26:07,877 --> 00:26:09,610
What was the user region
string on that browser?

678
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,260
And there's a whole host of
similar types of considerations

679
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,310
and signals that are
used as part of forming

680
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,720
a much more complex feature vector

681
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,840
that in turn can be used to determine

682
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,020
whether or not you are
who you say you are.

683
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,879
And these pieces of
information are, in fact,

684
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,330
much more reliable

685
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,562
than your simple username
or password alone.

686
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,490
And so we see that in the real world,

687
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,200
that's how the approach works.

688
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,780
Now in banking, you can
take this a step further

689
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,550
you can say, you know what?

690
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,159
I believe based on what I've seen so far

691
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,840
there's a 90% chance that
this is who it claims to be.

692
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,439
This is Zuli.

693
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,450
But maybe, for certain
transactions that's okay.

694
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,630
Maybe if all I'm trying to do
is maybe view my bank balance.

695
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,670
Then 90% may be good enough.

696
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,960
But I'm trying to transfer money

697
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,840
from my account somewhere else,

698
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,040
maybe at that point
you want 99% assurance.

699
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,450
Maybe you want to do some form of step up

700
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,810
or require someone to enter in

701
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,330
a multi-factor authentication code number.

702
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,510
Again, there are different
mechanisms you can choose.

703
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,050
You can effectively raise
the bar of identity assurance

704
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,409
and align it, juxtapose
it against the criticality

705
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,323
of what's being accessed and
take a risk based decision.

706
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,340
The second key pillar,

707
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,409
besides identity assurance, is
the idea of access assurance.

708
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,860
And this is really about ensuring

709
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,820
that we really understand

710
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,842
what users should be allowed to access.

711
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,180
In access assurance

712
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,520
I see a certain set of challenges
and also opportunities.

713
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,560
So first and foremost,

714
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,679
one of the biggest challenges
is digital transformation.

715
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,400
We are seeing more and
more devices out there

716
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,270
that leads to more and more identities,

717
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,600
more and more points of access

718
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,903
and much more complexity.

719
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,603
Secondly, there's
workforce transformation.

720
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,530
We're seeing people today
who are in a hybrid state.

721
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,670
Some are going to the office.

722
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,503
Some are working from home

723
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:57,240
and some are effectively
doing a bit of both.

724
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,140
I suspect that hybrid state
is gonna last for a long time.

725
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,053
On top of that,

726
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,600
we've seen a lot of people change roles

727
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,969
over the last year.

728
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,710
And in general, the idea of role changes

729
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,440
can create a lot of
complexity for organizations.

730
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,830
When a role changes,

731
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,260
you have to keep track of whether or not

732
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,000
a person's new set of
entitlements is legitimate

733
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,990
compared to what they had before

734
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,980
or whether or not you're
giving them access to something

735
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,383
they shouldn't be having
access to in the first place.

736
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,179
Third there's Nth-party risk.

737
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,710
Today we don't live in an atomic,

738
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,600
isolated instance unto ourselves.

739
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,580
Instead, every single one of us

740
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,760
is part of a much more complex community.

741
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Hyper-connected world
where every action we take

742
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,740
can have a dramatic ripple effect

743
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,703
in other parts of that ecosystem.

744
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,730
An issue that may happen with a partner

745
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,280
could in turn cause an
issue in your environment.

746
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,070
And when you've got
partners and organizations

747
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,919
and employees and customers
all engaging with each other,

748
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,600
authenticating with each other,

749
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,629
being given access to different
systems across the board,

750
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,970
what happens if one
person gets compromised?

751
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,180
What are the in turn
affects that can happen

752
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,800
in an organization

753
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,500
that itself creates a lot of complexity.

754
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,310
And finally, here's compliance.

755
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,270
We're seeing a world where
the compliance landscape

756
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,410
has shifted dramatically
with far more regulations.

757
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,580
And in that world, we've
gotta be very careful

758
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,669
about looking at data and how it's moving

759
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,320
and who should be accessing what.

760
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,040
I see also a range of opportunities here,

761
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,950
many of which involve

762
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,740
using techniques from
machine learning or AI.

763
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,000
And by this, I don't mean
fancy AI or machine learning,

764
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,570
I mean some basic element.

765
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,716
We can pre-populate entitlements.

766
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,300
We can identify entitlement errors.

767
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,220
We can enforce least privilege.

768
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,200
We could identify identity risk,

769
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,910
all through clever means.

770
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,750
And to me is a really amazing era.

771
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,150
It's a blue ocean of
opportunity for innovation.

772
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,409
Now, I'll be remiss in this talk

773
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,910
not to describe two
particular enterprise trends

774
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,653
that come up in the context
of identity management.

775
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,440
The first is zero trust.

776
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,850
And the second is passwordless.

777
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,149
Let me start with zero trust.

778
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,850
I'm sure many of you
are hearing this concept

779
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,899
and thinking about it on a regular basis.

780
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,639
So the terminology zero
trust dates back to 2010.

781
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,670
It was introduced by a Forrester analyst

782
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,480
name John Kindervag.

783
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,760
And it's predicated on the idea

784
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,129
that the original notion in security

785
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,100
of trust but verify should be replaced

786
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,773
by a more stringent notion
of never trust always verify.

787
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,280
At its core zero trust
is about the concept

788
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,020
that in cybersecurity
trust is a negative thing.

789
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,710
If I have to trust an entity,

790
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,060
trust a person, trust
anything for that matter,

791
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,060
that means I'm typically
assuming that that entity,

792
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,030
that person, that thing is
gonna behave in a certain way

793
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,410
but often without the
corresponding levels of assurance

794
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,940
that they actually will
behave in that way.

795
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,150
So we wanna minimize
what we trust in general

796
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,780
and gradually reduce the trust surface

797
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,050
with the ultimate Nirvana,

798
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,930
the ultimate goal

799
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,030
of getting to a trust service of zero.

800
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,290
Now we're never really gonna get there

801
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,030
but that's really the ultimate hope,

802
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,870
it's more of an aspirational cry

803
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,340
and a mindset if you will,

804
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,060
of any particular reasonably thought out,

805
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,460
detailed strategy that
can truly get us to zero.

806
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,560
But even though the
nomenclature of zero trust

807
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,520
came about in 2010,

808
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,060
the concept itself has been around,

809
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,840
really since the beginning of the industry

810
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,320
and the beginning of the
academic work in cybersecurity.

811
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,899
If you go back to 1976,
Jerry Saltzer at MIT

812
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,300
was working on the
Multics Operating System.

813
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,330
And in that context,

814
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,429
he introduced the idea of least privilege.

815
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,150
Not surprisingly about a year later

816
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,420
in the early papers on
cryptography that I talked about,

817
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,440
Rivest, Shamir and Adleman,

818
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,320
Diffie and Hellman and others,

819
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,720
talked about the idea of trust

820
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,020
in the context of public key cryptography,

821
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,700
specifically in the area
of certificate authorities

822
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,010
which were deemed to
be trusted authorities.

823
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,040
On these papers, they were very clear

824
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,159
that trust in this sense
was a negative thing.

825
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
You don't want to have to trust a CA

826
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,920
you're kind of forced to,

827
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,580
to bootstrap the rest of the system,

828
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,580
but typically you're making a
trust assumption to get there.

829
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,449
Ken Thompson was inspired
by the work of Jerry Saltzer

830
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,980
on Multics and he in turn developed

831
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,440
a simpler operating system
that we call a Unix.

832
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,810
And in 1984 received
the Alan M Turing Award,

833
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,659
the Nobel prize of computer science,

834
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,840
for his work on Unix.

835
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,419
and in his Turing Award lecture,

836
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,910
he talked about the
idea of trusting trust.

837
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,990
In fact, his lecture was called

838
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,980
Reflections on Trusting
Trust, available online,

839
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,333
I highly recommend you get
the transcript and read it.

840
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,200
But there he talked
about the idea of attacks

841
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,210
where you could embed something malicious

842
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,220
in a compiler that could then generate

843
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,890
a malicious executable,

844
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,790
including, by the way,
a malicious executable

845
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,470
of the compiler itself,

846
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,060
thereby creating a
perpetuating level of malice

847
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,909
that can be very difficult to detect.

848
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,710
The assault on trust continued
a decade later, in 1994,

849
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,710
as part of RFC 1636, where the
idea of the crunchy outside

850
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,030
with a soft and chewy
center was introduced.

851
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,010
And that terminology is now pervasive

852
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,670
in the security community,
been used many times

853
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,160
and we've heard it referred
to as a Tootsie roll analogy

854
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,900
or the M&M analogy and other
confections have been used

855
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,460
to describe the concept,

856
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,940
but it remains that we have to look away

857
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,550
from the traditional perimeter

858
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,070
and assume things on the
inside are trustworthy.

859
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,070
Now we can only assume that
nothing can be trusted.

860
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,659
Everything could
potentially be compromised

861
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,133
and/or could be usurped
by a clever adversary.

862
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,199
And so in 2003, the Jericho Forum

863
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,520
focused on the idea of
de-parameterization.

864
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,680
How do we move away from
the traditional perimeter

865
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,480
into a world where we are
much more decentralized

866
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,460
and have to think about trust locally?

867
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,310
And how do we minimize the
trust surface in that context?

868
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,900
Now with zero trust, we've
seen a lot of work on it.

869
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,610
Recently, NIST published
a wonderful report.

870
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,449
You can look at it,

871
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,060
Special Publication 800-207,

872
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,820
which highlights a number
of tenets of zero trust.

873
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,659
Now I wont to talk about them all here

874
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,180
but the point should be clear
that to achieve zero trust,

875
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,610
to get towards zero trust
date, never getting to zero

876
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,500
but really moving towards it,

877
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,193
you just have to look at technology

878
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:07,230
from a much more holistic lens.

879
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,760
No one, one technology
alone will get you there.

880
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,469
It's not just identity solution.

881
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,179
You may also have to have
integrated risk management.

882
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,750
You have to have network
monitoring, endpoint monitoring

883
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,880
and evolved SIM technology,

884
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,150
visibility insights and action

885
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,830
across your entire digital infrastructure

886
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,310
inclusive of all the cloud
elements, IOT, identities,

887
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,020
endpoint, network and so on and so forth.

888
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,060
If you don't think about
security, in that holistic sense

889
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,969
no matter what you do

890
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,509
you will not evolve along
that zero trust journey.

891
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,780
So it's much more complicated

892
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,080
than just one technology
alone will allude to.

893
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,310
Now in that vein passwordless has come up

894
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,489
as a way of really thinking about

895
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,939
whether we can even
eliminate passwords entirely.

896
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,169
Now, when I think about
password list in general

897
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,639
the idea is actually quite old,

898
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,980
even though the terminology

899
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,170
has gotten a lot of attention recently.

900
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,050
Many incumbent vendors

901
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,310
have been doing passwordless for years.

902
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,140
But there are some fundamental
questions to think through.

903
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,720
So number one, is a
passwordless experience

904
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,950
actually better from a user perspective?

905
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,210
Sometimes it is, but sometimes it isn't.

906
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,710
Some of these passwordless approaches

907
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,920
are in fact, quite complex,

908
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,680
involving devices that do
all sorts of fancy things

909
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,377
and are hard for individuals to use.

910
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,250
And what have you have
people who are color blind

911
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,830
or blind entirely, or can't hear properly?

912
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,330
Are you developing a
technology that can be used

913
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,273
by the masses?

914
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,780
Secondly, what happens in failure modes?

915
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,330
In many cases these failure modes

916
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,990
lead to these interesting paths

917
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,000
that ultimately rely on a password.

918
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,110
And so even though we tried
to eliminate passwords

919
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,710
in the first place, we may
not have fully succeeded.

920
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,640
And then finally,

921
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,220
can you look at that visibility itself

922
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,562
and leverage it as part of making

923
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:44,090
a much more informed risk orientation?

924
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,080
Tying back to the early
ideas of identity assurance

925
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,390
how do you juxtapose what's being accessed

926
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,640
with what you know about the
assurance levels that you have?

927
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,009
And so those are some of
the fundamental things

928
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,410
to think about in the
context of password lists.

929
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,853
And the final key point I wanna make is

930
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,503
for an identity in the ecosystem.

931
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,410
Identity is not something you
have to look at in isolation.

932
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,210
The reality is we have other technologies

933
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,377
in our security ecosystem

934
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,549
and identity has to tie
into those technologies.

935
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,983
Technologies like
integrated risk management

936
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,530
that can help us understand

937
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,860
who our most critical users are

938
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,290
and what the most
critical applications are.

939
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,480
And then we have to look at identity

940
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,430
with respect to how those
applications are being accessed.

941
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,589
Similarly, today's
security operation center

942
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,740
has to be identity aware.

943
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,272
You have to enable some
form of (indistinct)

944
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,710
or authentication to ensure

945
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,220
that the security operation
center gets to see

946
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,129
when there are failed login attempts,

947
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,110
when there are step ups.

948
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,490
And when those step ups
are not handled correctly

949
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,009
in the context of authentication.

950
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,180
And to me, integrated risk management,

951
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,669
your security operation center
and your identity ecosystem

952
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,070
all, in general, form the
three legs of the stool

953
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,137
that ultimately prop up a
successful security organization

954
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:57,040
and can help you navigate
to where you want to be

955
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,883
in the future and build
towards resilience.

956
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,273
So with that in mind,

957
00:37:02,273 --> 00:37:04,010
I wanna close by asking you

958
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,250
to think about what you've learned today

959
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,900
and to consider taking some
key steps moving forward.

960
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,980
So after you leave this conference,

961
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,010
you're gonna have a lot of great ideas,

962
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,780
take some time next week
to review what you learned

963
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,160
think about your identity
portfolio across the board

964
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,270
and make sure to adequately
considers identity assurance,

965
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,413
access assurance and activity assurance.

966
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,580
Within three months,

967
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,640
you should take time to
actually look at the tenets

968
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,900
of NIST SP 800-207, identify gaps

969
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,510
and calibrate your zero trust approach

970
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,013
to align with your overall
business objectives.

971
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,060
Then look for opportunities

972
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,880
to integrate your identity strategy

973
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,440
with your overall IRM

974
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,230
and security operation center strategies.

975
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,740
And about six months from now,

976
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,220
think about the gaps that are out there

977
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,250
and how you're gonna address
them with specific programs

978
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,600
once you've identified
what those gaps are.

979
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,810
Take a lean trust approach

980
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,570
that focuses on maximizing
the reduction in risk

981
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,513
for dollars spent.

982
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,240
Today I've talked about
a number of key areas.

983
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,089
We've talked about the idea

984
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,100
that digital identities are critical

985
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,893
for enabling trustworthiness
in digital transactions.

986
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,210
We talked about the idea
that identity assurance,

987
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,980
access assurance and activity assurance

988
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,320
are the three most critical pillars

989
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,073
in managing digital identity risk.

990
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,693
We looked at the idea

991
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:20,870
that we could have gradual evolution

992
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,330
and progress towards making identities

993
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,950
much more decentralized.

994
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,589
Moving towards zero trust

995
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,777
and gradually eliminating
the need for passwords

996
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:29,720
and some of the challenges that occur

997
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,669
when you try to go in those directions.

998
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,180
And finally, we looked
at the overall ecosystem

999
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,549
involving identity
governance and lifecycle,

1000
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,140
integrated risk management

1001
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,029
and your security operation center.

1002
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,990
As key tenets of the overall ecosystem

1003
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,939
when you think about digital identities

1004
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,120
and making them much more resilient.

1005
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,953
Over this past year,

1006
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:51,890
with COVID-19, our experiences
have been much more virtual.

1007
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,339
We have used digital technologies

1008
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,210
to help us make it past this year

1009
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,930
and do some really amazing things.

1010
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,379
But if digital technology is a rocket ship

1011
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,993
the engine is trust.

1012
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,000
We can't embrace digital
technology without trust.

1013
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,993
And if the engine is trust,

1014
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:11,890
then the fuel for that
trust is digital identity.

1015
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,339
The stakes have never been higher.

1016
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,740
And I encourage you to
think about these concepts.

1017
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,319
With that, I wanna thank you for your time

1018
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,700
and hope you have a
wonderful remaining part

1019
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,663
of the conference.
