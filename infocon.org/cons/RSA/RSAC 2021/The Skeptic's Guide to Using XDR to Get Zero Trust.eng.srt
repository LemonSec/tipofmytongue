00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,330
- Hi, my name is Greg Young,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,210
and I am the Vice
President for Cybersecurity

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,810
for Trend Micro.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,860
And thank you for attending my talk today

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,870
at the RSA Conference.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,200
This is the biggest invest event

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
and it's a privilege to speak here.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,610
And my topic today is going to be

9
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,610
the Skeptics Guide to Using
XDR to Get More Zero Trust.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,660
That is a very difficult title to parse.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,620
So what I'm really talking
about today are two trends

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,070
that are very important
in security right now.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,450
One is XDR, which we're going
to explain and talk about,

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,120
and the other is Zero Trust.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,230
And these have, for a while,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,669
been talked about very independently

17
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,670
but right now and later
after 2021 and into 2022,

18
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,790
I expect we're gonna be hearing

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,410
a lot more about these together.

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,669
The promises being proposed around this

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,970
and the hype is a little high right now.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,180
So I'm always concerned when
I hear that kind of hype

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,820
and we wanna really get to the bottom of,

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,640
is this something practical we can do

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,140
or is this just joining
two hyped things together

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,183
to try to create
something that isn't real?

27
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,373
My background, I've been in
cybersecurity for 33 years now.

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,770
Rick Astley was number four
with, "Never Gonna Give You Up"

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,089
when I started in cybersecurity.

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,460
So that was a timely
spot to start my career

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,523
with effectively what was
a meme that we used a lot.

32
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,487
In those 33 years, I have been a CISO

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,810
with the Federal
Department Communications,

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,520
with Gartner for 14 years

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,520
as their Lead Analyst for
Network Security and Military,

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,527
a bunch of other jobs and
consulting and stuff like that.

37
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:44,437
And in the last three years,

38
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,700
I have been in Trend as
Head of Cybersecurity.

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,820
So with that perspective,

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,860
hopefully we're going to
deconfuse the key things.

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,679
But really also take the skeptical
eye into these two trends

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,060
and seeing, is there a conjunction
of them that's meaningful

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,960
to you as you do your job in security?

44
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,890
I subtitled this that We
Were Promised Jetpacks

45
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,850
and Correlation, that there's
been a lot of promises.

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,502
Hey, in my 33 years,
I've seen a lot of them.

47
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,970
Some are true and some don't come true.

48
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,820
But there's been a lot,

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,107
there's so much promises around,

50
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:18,570
"If you bring things together,
it's going to be better."

51
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,597
But there's often a lot of
gotchas or asterisk there

52
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:23,890
that we need to pay attention to.

53
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,600
So the promises and especially
around the one correlation

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,170
is bringing information together,

55
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,589
is it gonna be more meaningful for you?

56
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,140
That's where we're going
to particularly dive into.

57
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,800
So what's been going on?

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,913
Why are we talking about this
first trend, which is XDR?

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,940
We're gonna to define it.

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,060
But I'm gonna talk about
what the problem is first.

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,290
So the Security Operations
Center and security teams,

62
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,579
they have been wanting
fast detection and response

63
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,460
across the entire environment.

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,293
One of the challenges

65
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,340
has been with all these security stuff

66
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,410
that's been curling
around our environment,

67
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,993
we've created a lot of silos.

68
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,260
So depth of protection,
that's a great thing.

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,769
But when silos don't
communicate that as a crack,

70
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,250
the bad guys can exploit.

71
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,960
And the SOC teams particularly

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,030
notices that they're the ones

73
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,270
who have to connect the breadcrumbs

74
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,520
or follow the breadcrumbs,
especially between these silos

75
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
that aren't naturally sharing consoles

76
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
or sharing information between them.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
So we've had other tools like (indistinct)

78
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,630
which is a link in between them.

79
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,420
But from the SOC teams
perspective, that's only one tool.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,790
These attacks don't stay in silos,

81
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,780
the security teams need
to piece these together

82
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,513
what's really happening.

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,630
EDR, Endpoint Protection
and Response is one of them

84
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,463
that goes beyond

85
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,810
the traditional sort of
endpoint protection platforms

86
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,920
that we've seen.

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,190
And EDR gives you more information.

88
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,800
So not necessarily just
sort of that spot and block,

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,617
but it gives you that deep
sort of amount of information

90
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:53,109
that's going on at the endpoint.

91
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,520
So that's been useful for SOCs.

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,660
But there's other things that
we have to dive into as well.

93
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,859
And they all seem to have
this sort of greater depth

94
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,390
that they have.

95
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,470
But we've also got the split of,

96
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,760
our technologies are split now.

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,679
So of course, cloud has provided

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,350
this other sort of silo split
between on premise and cloud.

99
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,960
And additionally, with
new kinds of environments,

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,210
even between cloud environments,

101
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,380
that's new kinds of silos were created.

102
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,920
So there's been a lot
of emphasis now in need.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,620
And one of the big silos we've
had is email, for example,

104
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,410
that emails separate sort of silos,

105
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,070
separate group managing it.

106
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,710
And, again, same as one view
but for a SOC team alert

107
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,250
that's only sort of one
sort of alerting piece

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,000
they're looking for and
doesn't give the full depth

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
of information that they need.

110
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,823
So the goal behind or the
theory behind what XDR was,

111
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,989
another one definition of it

112
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,210
is extended detection and response.

113
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,229
So EDR is the endpoint detection response.

114
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,800
And there's other DR sort
of things out there as well.

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,180
But this extended detection and response

116
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,190
is the idea to bring that
deep information analogous

117
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,510
to what we have with EDR

118
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,130
across all of this
stuff in the enterprise.

119
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,420
Well, that is a story

120
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,840
that we've been telling
for a long time in security

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,679
about one pane of glass
bringing it all together

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,600
and the like.

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,670
So why is that gonna change?

124
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,170
Well, one of the things
that's changed is MITRE.

125
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,570
I think what MITRE has done

126
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,247
is provided a really good
sort of view in saying,

127
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,517
"Hey, look, attacks aren't
shored up, one and done,

128
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,270
"throw a rock over the
fence, and we're finished,"

129
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,157
instead what MITRE does is they say,

130
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:30,686
"Look, we've analyzed attackers deeply.

131
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:34,917
"And they do this very kind
of lateral low and slow

132
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,116
"kinds of movements and
they're smart about it.

133
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:41,517
"And unfortunately, they have
targeted many of their attacks

134
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,387
"around these cracks between the silos

135
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,340
"that we have in our enterprise."

136
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,340
So when we look at a
lot of the APT29, Cozy,

137
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,230
as a few examples, they're listed,

138
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,990
but this way the attackers operate

139
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,230
is knowing what our defenses are.

140
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,580
And when our defenses are in silos

141
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,130
and when we don't have deep information,

142
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,963
they know that.

143
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,630
And they know what some of
the triggers are going to be

144
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,409
to set off alerts, to set off alarms.

145
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,120
So that's why now attacks can take months,

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,850
some almost up to a
year or more sometimes.

147
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,980
Knowing that, we don't
keep information that long.

148
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,620
And it's expensive to
keep a lot of information.

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,970
That's one of the gotchas in
trying to address this problem

150
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,030
is that if we're not keeping

151
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,309
sort of full packet capture
for years and years,

152
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,360
that would be almost impossible.

153
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,020
The bad guys are really optimizing

154
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,760
how they're doing their attacks that way.

155
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,640
So these are some of the
challenges that are being faced

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,837
right now by real security evaluations.

157
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,969
And again, not theoretical, this is real

158
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,160
that many of the attacks we're seeing now,

159
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,640
and not just the state sponsored one.

160
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,150
So yes, a state sponsored attack

161
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,030
is gonna be the most sort of advanced

162
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,010
and the most devious to handle,

163
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,860
but for attacks today that
aren't sort of, quickly blocked

164
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,053
by the safeguards that we
have in the individual silos,

165
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,300
because the bad guy is, knowing this

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,900
or it's a attack involving
intentionally multiple steps

167
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,162
where no step will be sort of
triggered, that's a concern.

168
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,610
Platforms were supposed to fix all this.

169
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,620
So we were promised platforms.

170
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,453
And by that

171
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,770
I mean things we're all
supposed to be joining together,

172
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,947
that for years, vendors
have been promising saying,

173
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:21,177
"Hey, we have our APIs, you buy our stuff,

174
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:23,077
"it's gonna communicate better together,

175
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,637
"or offering up an API,
it's going to be complex

176
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,787
"and cumbersome and it's
going to change a lot,

177
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:30,090
"so nobody's gonna integrate it with it."

178
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,780
That's been the challenges with it.

179
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,489
And this sort of, buy everything
from one vendor approach,

180
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,370
hasn't worked, nor is the API only one,

181
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,720
because again, especially
with newer products,

182
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,470
and some of the newer
products that come out

183
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,190
are some of the greatest ones, of course,

184
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,120
because they're gonna
address the newest threats,

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,330
they haven't had time yet

186
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,490
to sort of be backwardly compatible

187
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,450
with some of the other tools you're using

188
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,659
and integrate with those APIs.

189
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,333
So the problem has been
it's been a sort of a push,

190
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,340
promising, yes, once you
integrate with these things,

191
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,739
then you can get this magic.

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,467
Instead, the formula should have been,

193
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,007
"Hey, we're going to have stuff

194
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:12,140
"that works with everything out
there once we introduce it,"

195
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,110
as a goal of a product itself.

196
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,930
So I think rely on the
individual safeguards,

197
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,850
all the individual products,

198
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,393
you have to integrate with each other,

199
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:21,710
it's just not going to happen.

200
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,570
It's just, not everybody's
gonna play well together.

201
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,010
And not 'cause they wanna
make your life difficult.

202
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,570
It's just, when you have
that many moving parts,

203
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,340
it's going to be problematic.

204
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,709
So this API stuff is great.

205
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,950
You can get great information from there.

206
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,460
But that hasn't worked.

207
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,610
One of the other issues

208
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,580
is that when a lot of companies

209
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,370
focus on integrating their own products

210
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,960
to get better detection together,

211
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,840
they naturally exclude third parties.

212
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,120
So neither approaches work.

213
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,960
This sort of open source API
approach, that's one view.

214
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,470
And there's promise there,

215
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,247
but the implementation hasn't worked.

216
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,786
Now is the other side saying,
"Only our stuff works,

217
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:00,837
"you have to buy all of our stuff

218
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:04,210
"to get it really good security promise."

219
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,043
And then recognition,

220
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,600
especially for very large enterprises

221
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,630
or even large enterprises,
in fact enterprises,

222
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,950
or even small medium sized businesses

223
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,740
they have multiple products
from multiple vendors,

224
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,800
unless it's a really small business,

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,500
they're only gonna have
one security product

226
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,640
and go with that.

227
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,210
So the expectation is there's
going to be heterogeneity.

228
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,410
So how are we going to
get this information

229
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,270
across those and

230
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,939
get it in a way that's useful

231
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,437
to a quick response?

232
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:32,410
And we don't have days to kind
of parse this information.

233
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,680
And this has been part of
the challenge with SIEMs

234
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,430
is the security information
and event management tools,

235
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,560
they're not timely enough
nor do they have the depth.

236
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,780
They're getting the alert,

237
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,150
but the information behind it

238
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,720
doesn't come with it quite often.

239
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,553
And that's natural, right?

240
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,340
The same is gonna be this
joining everything there.

241
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,870
This timely, quick
kitchen immediately tool,

242
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,470
but the information you need behind

243
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,633
it's been a very, very
manual process up until now.

244
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,620
So data persistence has
been a big problem as well

245
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,230
that as the APIs change,
that's been an issue.

246
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,920
And there's lowest API denominator

247
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,780
that you're only getting the information

248
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,010
that is offered up in the API.

249
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,580
What if I need more?

250
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,850
And what is security relevant on one day

251
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,090
may not be security relevant
in the next incident.

252
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,370
And by that I mean sort of
what's offered up in the API

253
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,990
is often not rich enough,

254
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,510
that they give sort of
that traditional view

255
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,490
of what a firewall rule is

256
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,570
that there's gonna be
a to, from, what port,

257
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,510
and the time and some other
information like that.

258
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,830
Well, what about if I want
some other information

259
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,340
about what happened in that transaction

260
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,700
that may not seem to be security relevant

261
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,800
but it's going to be critical

262
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,522
once I start to piece
together an attack chain?

263
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,420
So this is where we've come
now with the promises of XDR

264
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,050
is that we've had a lot
of things out there.

265
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,250
And here's some of the
many acronyms we have

266
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,640
with the endpoint protection platforms,

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,770
manage detection and
response, when somebody else

268
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,439
like some people start to help
look through the information

269
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
in case you're not enough there,

270
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
EDR is that extended view that goes down

271
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,560
and we talked about SIEM
and the ones in yellow,

272
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,849
or once I made up because
acronyms are funny

273
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,290
and we have too many insecurity.

274
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,939
So we'll just filter those out for now.

275
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,220
But we have all of these approaches

276
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,380
that have tried to solve
bits of the problem.

277
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,237
When in turn we said,
"Hey, look, we need a glue

278
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:23,796
"between not just the endpoint stuff,

279
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:26,207
"but all the stuff in the enterprise."

280
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,800
And that's been sort of the grail

281
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,786
we've been searching for and
XDR is intentionally designed

282
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:39,093
to make a new run at this.

283
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,900
So what's it really composed of?

284
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Well, XDR, to me, when I
put everything else aside

285
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,900
and I say, "Give me the
elevator pitch on this,"

286
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,930
I say that XDR is a data lake

287
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,609
of a whole bunch of information

288
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,913
that I could possibly want
to deal with security.

289
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,060
It's gonna do a couple of things as well,

290
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,550
it's not just gonna be the information,

291
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,990
it's going to be interpretation of it.

292
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,230
Hey, we've heard for three years now

293
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,490
about how awesome AI and ML
are gonna make our lives.

294
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,130
Well, where is it?

295
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,270
Well, the idea is that

296
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,949
when you have large amounts of
information to parse through

297
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,230
or large amounts of data to
come up with information from,

298
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,230
that is where machine
learning, and hopefully AI

299
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,560
will play a role.

300
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
That has to be a key part of it,

301
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,140
we can't expect our same operators

302
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,370
to do a better job by
throwing more information

303
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,483
that is just unorganized at them.

304
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,293
So that's great.

305
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:38,700
So we're gonna have more
information to draw from,

306
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,930
from all of the stuff in the enterprise.

307
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,729
And we're gonna have some assistance

308
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,760
in finding out what's important there,

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,689
which should be easier, not harder.

310
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,380
And by that I mean the
more information we have,

311
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,547
the more focused we should be on saying,

312
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,790
"Yes, this is an attack or not."

313
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,699
What we don't wanna get into
is this tsunami of alerts

314
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,077
that saying, "We're just
gonna throw more alerts

315
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:02,840
"of anything remotely
suspicious at the operator."

316
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,800
No, that's not good enough,
it should be smarter.

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,380
The more information we have,

318
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,040
it should be a more focused
and more determined one.

319
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,439
We have only a couple of data points

320
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
we can say, "Yeah, that's suspicious,"

321
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,810
but we have a lot we can
either include or exploit that.

322
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,479
And that's what a true XDR should be,

323
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,253
not just a noisier SIEM
or a noisier data tool.

324
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,900
One thing that often gets
missed in this discussion

325
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,380
of what XDR should be
or is going to be or is

326
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,980
is the response part.

327
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,813
And that has to be a key part of it.

328
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:32,170
If it's not enough when
we have all this AI and ML

329
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,560
that if there are actions we can take,

330
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,969
that all the stuff that we
have the response towards

331
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,610
haven't taken yet,

332
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,170
as long as it's a valid response tool

333
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,319
and that we have better information of it,

334
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,110
we have higher confidence,
whether human configured

335
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,800
or we're saying we're going
to set conditions for it,

336
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,339
response has to be part of it.

337
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,740
Just can't be again, more actions

338
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,080
that we're gonna load up on the SOC team

339
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,030
or on other ops groups.

340
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,520
So response is critical

341
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,220
to being a part of a
true sort of XDR approach

342
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
that you could take.

343
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,740
And again, it can't be sort of one silo.

344
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,350
The idea is it's going
to be endpoints networks,

345
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,660
email, cloud workloads,

346
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,199
it has to have enterprise-wide coverage.

347
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,580
Because as a SOC operator,

348
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,290
you're going to be looking
at all these places anyway,

349
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,660
you're gonna have consoles
open from all of these things,

350
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,620
20, 30 consoles on some days

351
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,640
to try to track and saying,
"Is this a valid chain?"

352
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,470
Email is the one that often gets missed

353
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,790
because, what is it, 97% of all attacks

354
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,400
involve an email Nexus.

355
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,893
And unfortunately, that's
been ignored quite a bit.

356
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,300
But can't just be again,
sort of, let's just do a scan

357
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,140
of the enterprise much
like we do in other ways.

358
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,747
So the endpoint side must be saying,

359
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,257
"Hey, we've got telemetry there with EDR,

360
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:49,416
"we should be pulling that telemetry

361
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,610
"and make it more interpretive."

362
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,960
So how did it propagate?

363
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,300
And we should have a very good view,

364
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,530
not only for a single endpoint,

365
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,737
but endpoint to endpoint to say,

366
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:02,367
"Hey, a suspicious 1A went
to B and then talk to C,

367
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,396
"that's important,"

368
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,760
especially when they use
other kinds of Nexus.

369
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,580
So yes, in this case, these
endpoints send an email

370
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,750
to here and then to there.

371
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,770
And one of the great concerns

372
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,207
is that there's been an
over focus on saying,

373
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,117
"This endpoint is getting
a lot of suspicious emails,

374
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,370
"that should be a flag."

375
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,270
It's actually the reverse

376
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,770
that if you're sending out
a lot of suspicious emails,

377
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,699
that should change things.

378
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,550
We're gonna talk about that in a bit.

379
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,030
And it has to also include
cloud workloads and containers.

380
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,640
And unfortunately, as
cloud has moved so quickly

381
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,150
into organizations that the
ability to pull in information

382
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,270
has been very siloed
and a lot of the tools

383
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,110
that we're being forced to use today

384
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,440
for security alerting and
analysis in cloud environments

385
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,810
are proprietary to the cloud provider

386
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,520
that you're using the CSP.

387
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,010
And by that, I mean if you're in Amazon,

388
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,740
you have to use an AWS toolkit.

389
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,920
You don't have to, but the
tendency is to use an AWS tool.

390
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,740
Well, there is a lot of
information that AWS, Azure,

391
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,010
Google Cloud provide you
through, in their case,

392
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,740
APIs that you can pull information from,

393
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,410
why isn't that being used richly?

394
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,339
And it's not just the security APIs,

395
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,620
it's other kinds of information APIs.

396
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,900
So if you have a virtual switch,

397
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,290
sure there's security information there.

398
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,010
But there's other communication
information that switch

399
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,610
that could be crucial in
tracking down an attack

400
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,300
that may not be labeled
as a security event.

401
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,209
But it's going to be helpful
in a real security event

402
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,660
in tracking that down quickly.

403
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,199
And often our operators,
our great SOC operator

404
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
will know about those tools,

405
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,970
and again, have multiple consoles open,

406
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,387
but why are we making them do that?

407
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:43,260
And why aren't we pulling
that information in

408
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,110
and doing some better analysis on it?

409
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,959
And also from the workloads themselves,

410
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,060
what happened in the individual workloads?

411
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,579
The network as well as
that incredible silo

412
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,870
and the bad guys know that.

413
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,690
Again, it's not just about sort of,

414
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,920
if you take an endpoint
only view of the world,

415
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,939
saying, "Yeah, we have a
view of all the endpoints,"

416
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,210
but not all of your endpoints are managed.

417
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,150
And if you have these blind
spots for unmanaged endpoints

418
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,470
or unsanctioned services,
whether it be cloud service,

419
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,233
or a workload in the cloud,

420
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,000
that's what the bad guys are
often going to be utilizing.

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,950
They know that a heavily watched,

422
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,430
heavily monitored kind of resources.

423
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,109
So that's why they like to go after IoT.

424
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,532
That's why they love shadow IT,

425
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,090
because that's gonna be the stuff

426
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,740
that's going to not set
off tripwires and alerts.

427
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,210
So having visibility into that

428
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,110
is almost ironically outside
the visibility of security,

429
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,526
we're saying, "Hey, look,
we've got great view

430
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,407
"into these endpoints,

431
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:43,817
"we've got great view into these.

432
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:44,917
"These are the things we manage

433
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,659
"We're really gonna watch those."

434
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,493
And instead you're saying,

435
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,976
"Hey, the doors that aren't being watched,

436
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:54,927
"or that facility that we
own that we're only leasing,

437
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,629
"not owning, so we don't have
the same security on it."

438
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,970
That's the kind of irony

439
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,083
that we really should have the
more security visibility on.

440
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,409
And those are some of the
hardest things of course to watch

441
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,313
because they're unmanaged by nature.

442
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,439
So that's been the picture to date on XDR.

443
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
So conference has been good,
XDR has been advancing.

444
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,050
Unfortunately, there's
a lot of XDR watching,

445
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,830
taking traditional EDR, and
labeling them as what XDR is.

446
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,827
So as a skeptic, you should
approach them and saying,

447
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:36,367
"Hey, look, I should be
linking information together,

448
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:39,377
"there should be machine
learning assistance at a minimum

449
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:42,466
"with talk or roadmap for AI

450
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,087
"and there has to be a response function.

451
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:46,210
"And it has to include
email and endpoints."

452
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,130
You can't ignore those, it
can't be just a network focus

453
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,730
or just a richer SIEM.

454
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,970
And it has to pull
information from SIEM as well.

455
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,910
There's great information
there to be pulled in.

456
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,890
But it has to include all of those.

457
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,490
So that's kind of where XDR sits.

458
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,210
So let's take a look now at
where we are with Zero Trust.

459
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,610
We've been talking about
Zero Trust for a while.

460
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,670
It's sprinkled, it's almost like a preface

461
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,390
to a conversation now almost like,

462
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,480
if we're in medieval times,

463
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,030
instead of starting
with, "My Lord, my lady,"

464
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,350
we're starting out with all
our security conversations

465
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,362
in Zero Trust or ending with those.

466
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,520
And it's been very cloudy
about what that is.

467
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,590
And I have been very, very skeptical

468
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,100
because that conversation
has been very amorphous.

469
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,929
And it hasn't been very
specific or prescriptive

470
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,710
about what this means.

471
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,760
So we all agree that Zero Trust is great.

472
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,960
But there's been a lot
of Zero Trust watching

473
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,910
and a lot of misunderstanding about it.

474
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,530
And I think the
misunderstanding is natural

475
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,080
because this is a very
nuanced topic, it turns out,

476
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,870
but there is some truth here.

477
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,750
So let's dig in and find
out what's going on there.

478
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,970
This all came into focus as
you can see on the slide,

479
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,450
because of an event you
may have heard about.

480
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,430
That what happened, that's
interest of security perspective

481
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,380
during this and as much as Zero Trust

482
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,380
was the change in the workforce
that COVID-19 imposed on us

483
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,149
and additionally, how it's
changing our enterprise.

484
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,983
Two things happened.

485
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,379
Of course, one is that,
there's naturally some response

486
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,177
but there's also been
the opportunity to say,

487
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,296
"Hey, look, there's some
stuff that is better

488
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,170
"that this gives us
the opportunity to do."

489
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,670
So one is work from home.

490
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,170
So the revolution and work from home

491
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,500
as we're all experiencing

492
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,740
and I'm experiencing with you right now

493
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,890
is that this solely took a lot of people

494
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,730
that were on the inside

495
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,820
and put them "on the
outside" of our networks.

496
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,720
We've always had work from home

497
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,290
but this really kind of changed it.

498
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,730
And the work from home or remote working

499
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,903
that we've been doing was pretty bad.

500
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,530
We're gonna talk about that as well.

501
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,960
But it's been very cumbersome.

502
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,850
And it's been kind of a great weak point

503
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,812
that attackers could exploit.

504
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,159
And it hasn't only been sort
of the VPN side that's changed,

505
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,900
it's also the kinds of
machines that we're working on,

506
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,140
it's really changed the attack surface.

507
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,857
So many, as tech workers
were often privileged

508
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,380
to have resources do our job.

509
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,450
But for many industries,

510
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,420
and many of the people that we
serve, are not so fortunate.

511
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,160
So for example, they
may be sharing a laptop

512
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,610
with family members,

513
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,750
either kids who are
doing school from home.

514
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,060
So the kinds of endpoints

515
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,490
and the environment that they're in

516
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,610
are very, very different.

517
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,209
So one thing is they're
probably not as patched,

518
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,290
probably not as maintained,
they may be personally owned,

519
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,600
they may be shared,

520
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,899
they may have somebody
else's information on them,

521
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,180
multiple users,

522
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,230
and of course, they're not
as corporately controlled

523
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,160
as they were.

524
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,440
So sure it's not for everybody,
but it's really changed.

525
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,080
This environment is not the standard,

526
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,590
I-take-my-laptop-on-the-Road
Warrior kind of experience.

527
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,100
This is doing all of your
jobs that you have to do

528
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,740
from these kinds of home environments

529
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,690
with potentially sketchy kinds
of comms environments tools

530
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,790
such as weak routers,

531
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,503
which make for a really
great attack surface.

532
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,899
The complexity that this
has introduced to us

533
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,250
has been significant.

534
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,600
So always wanted to have a
SOC that looked like this,

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,780
by the way, like this slide.

536
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,190
So this is, of course,
your reactor control room.

537
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,160
But wouldn't it be great

538
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,300
if we had simple dials like these?

539
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,899
This is very kind of steampunk, in a way.

540
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,780
But the complexity that we've introduced

541
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,260
has been significant through this.

542
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,237
So it's not just enough to say,

543
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:33,180
"Oh, well, you just connect to a VPN."

544
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,430
No, no, no, because those people

545
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,510
who are outside your
network connecting now

546
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,020
are also connecting up
to the cloud, right?

547
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,750
So they're going potentially
from unmanaged devices,

548
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,300
up to unsanctioned cloud resources.

549
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,870
Additionally, there's
use your communication

550
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,600
dealing with third party
tools that they use,

551
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,050
which are really hard
to have visibility into.

552
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,490
And the kind of threat
and posture that we have

553
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,490
is very different.

554
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,990
So this is really challenged SOCs.

555
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,850
And also there's a privacy
aspects, of course,

556
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,780
of how much you dig
into a home based tool,

557
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,980
or home based laptop or device

558
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,080
in addition, of course, all
the IoT stuff that we have now

559
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,800
and all the third party
tools that we're using.

560
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,850
So it's really amped up the complexity.

561
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,860
So what happened

562
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,800
at the start of this
work at home revolution,

563
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,870
not only changed sort of
the inside of our view,

564
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,800
but it really stressed and fractured

565
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,850
a lot of the issues of complexity

566
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,070
that we've been struggling with,

567
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,080
especially around sort
of some of the staticness

568
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,860
we've expected around connections

569
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,663
and split tunnels are
naturally a risky thing.

570
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,190
So there's so many configs we have now.

571
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,380
It's much more complex network,

572
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,770
especially as these
teleworkers now or home workers

573
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,610
may move around themselves,

574
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,120
it's really changed the traffic flow

575
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,780
and integrating this is very different.

576
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,760
And of course, the opaqueness of VPNs

577
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,453
also introduces a real problem.

578
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,290
But as we look at sort of Zero Trust,

579
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,639
I'm gonna be stressing a concept

580
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,590
that Zero Trust discussions
don't normally have,

581
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,199
which is visibility.

582
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,490
And one of the skeptics
view I'm going to have

583
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,070
is that if you're having
any Zero Trust discussions,

584
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,082
is that visibility is
an important part of it.

585
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,133
Great time right now

586
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,990
to talk about Zero Trust really quickly.

587
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,050
To say that Zero Trust is a concept,

588
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,970
it's an architectural approach.

589
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,140
And it is in response

590
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,040
to many, in fact, the stresses
we've had with work from home

591
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,490
that has been in response to.

592
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,100
We're gonna diagram some of these

593
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,709
and hopefully this will
make a bit of a picture

594
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,253
about where Zero Trust comes from.

595
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,463
Some of the other stresses
we've had in visibility,

596
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,960
is part of this shadow IT,

597
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,470
so that's IT that is
not sort of known about

598
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,900
or owned by the CIO organization.

599
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,210
The off network activity we've
talked about, moving cloud,

600
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,070
not just moving to cloud,

601
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,939
but then shifting from cloud to cloud.

602
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,620
And the attackers of course, have wised up

603
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,030
in this new environment
with work from home

604
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,600
that it's a great place to attack.

605
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,820
Why go after the hard network

606
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,189
when you've got all the
sort of keys to the kingdom

607
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,270
out floating around

608
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,363
in this sort of sketchy home environment?

609
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,970
One of the other sort of
drivers for Zero Trust

610
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,950
has been the attacker behavior's changed.

611
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,890
As I've talked about with MITRE,

612
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,400
that the stealthy
movement, lateral movement,

613
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,250
and we've also seen the
severity increasing.

614
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,970
I spend my days in this environment

615
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,500
and I've seen a few shifts.

616
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,150
And one of the shifts I think I've seen

617
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,700
in the last two years definitely

618
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,710
has been about the attacker capabilities.

619
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,663
So yeah, we've always had that.

620
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:48,180
This is not just sort of
everything old is new again, no.

621
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,420
The complexity of the attacks

622
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,000
and the sophistication of
them is on the increase.

623
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,770
And that's not state sponsored stuff.

624
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,160
I think everybody agrees now

625
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,690
with the kinds of attacks
we're seeing in the general use

626
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,440
are much more advanced, not
just sort of ransomware only.

627
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,230
But all kinds of attacks,
there's almost no attacks today

628
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,410
are single step, they're all multi step.

629
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,900
And the capability and
the quality of the code

630
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,689
and the platforms using
are much, much increased.

631
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,800
So all this to say that
this amorphous thing

632
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,190
about what Zero Trust is
supposed to be keeps coming up

633
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,560
that as the attackers change,

634
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,639
as our environments have changed,

635
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,880
the old ways of doing
things aren't good enough.

636
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,030
And there was always something
that old-timey security nerds

637
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,379
used to have on their business cards

638
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,720
not all of them, but a lot of them,

639
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,620
especially ones who were
focused on policy and the like

640
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,479
would have were saying,
"Trust but verify."

641
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
And they probably have in Latin, too,

642
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,629
because they're trying to
(indistinct) more sophisticated.

643
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,437
But trust but verify means
"Yes, we're going to trust you,

644
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:57,270
"but we're gonna check out

645
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,557
"to make sure that you
are who you say you are

646
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,240
"and what you're doing is authorized."

647
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,070
Well, that's clearly not good enough

648
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,340
in this new environment,

649
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,639
that this sort of flipping
of the script we've had,

650
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,640
because of complexity,
membership, scale of things,

651
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,480
that everything has gone,
the attacker capabilities,

652
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,910
everything stretched the old
models we had to crankiness.

653
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,260
So it hasn't really broken it

654
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,330
but we're at that point of
really it's almost broken

655
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,163
and we're almost to that point

656
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,510
of sort of flipping magnetic north.

657
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,487
And I think that it has
to be flipped to say that,

658
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:31,353
"No, we're going to, instead
of, trust but verify,

659
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,157
"it's going to be we're gonna verify you

660
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:35,830
"then we're going to trust you."

661
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,720
And that's the position we're in,

662
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,330
not to the point of interfering

663
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,730
with what you're doing so much,

664
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,170
but the old way of doing them

665
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,860
always have to change
incrementally, not overnight.

666
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,693
But it's gotta change

667
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:46,840
and there's gotta be ways to do it.

668
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Just doing the old stuff
we did with more scale,

669
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,393
not good enough.

670
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:52,830
We've gotta really change
and look for new approaches,

671
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,300
because we have technology to do this.

672
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,973
So why aren't we doing it?

673
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,240
A lot of noise around
Zero Trust, as you expect,

674
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,360
saying, "Yay, everything
ZT or Zero Trust now,"

675
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,367
lots of terms out there thrown with it,

676
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:12,200
you're ZTNA, you're SASE,
you're Zero Trust certified.

677
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,507
Your poor clients even say,
people out there saying,

678
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:18,017
"Hey, just sell me some Zero Trust."

679
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,790
And that's just not doable.

680
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,490
It's like selling you
five pounds of health.

681
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,290
So what is this really all
about, this Zero Trust stuff?

682
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,860
Well, the old models we have,

683
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,709
everything on the network is trusted,

684
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,110
we're gonna assume identities
are not compromised.

685
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,790
If you're allowed in, if
you pass it on occasion,

686
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,740
that's good enough.

687
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,660
We're gonna assume users act responsibly,

688
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,240
we're going to work to
detect attacker behavior.

689
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,810
We have to flip this around.

690
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,860
And part of these
fundamental architectural

691
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,419
and design changes are that
you don't get a lot of trust

692
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,360
by defaults or just by
your membership in a group

693
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,429
or your identity,

694
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,630
you don't automatically get that

695
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,000
just by sort of being in club.

696
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,690
No, you have to have that assigned to you.

697
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,280
There's been attempts
to do this in the past,

698
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,629
which have been unsuccessful.

699
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,400
And that should be part of your skepticism

700
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,810
is that there's no magic bullet for this.

701
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,649
And it's not gonna be solved

702
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,483
with sort of one thing,

703
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,070
there's going to be a bunch of things

704
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,903
that are gonna solve it.

705
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:16,150
But there are a few pillars.

706
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,699
Verifying everything for identity,

707
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,300
and identity should not just
be extended out indefinitely.

708
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,270
It shouldn't just go on forever,

709
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,367
saying, "Right, once you're in you're in,

710
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,447
"your identity is fine.

711
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,570
"And we're just gonna say
that you're good now,"

712
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,223
that's not good enough as well.

713
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,100
Of course, we're going to be
watching in more depth now

714
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,399
about the transaction that are going on.

715
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,840
We understand, I think,
that now fundamentally,

716
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,929
but we also just can't say
we're just gonna tech stuff.

717
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,880
We have to make stuff
harder as part of this.

718
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,880
And start to see why some
of the concepts in XDR

719
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,860
start to now really link with Zero Trust

720
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,669
to say, "Hey, that," Greg
just told me a few minutes ago

721
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,010
saying that the response
capability have to be there.

722
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,780
Yes, it can't just be about
detection is good enough.

723
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,020
We just went through
this phase where we said

724
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,910
detection is everything.

725
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,160
No, that's not everything.

726
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
You can't give up response.

727
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,600
So detection is yes,
more important than ever,

728
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,793
but response and prevention is not.

729
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,010
There's a nice publication out there,

730
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,750
a special publication on Zero Trust,

731
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,190
which I encourage you to look at.

732
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,310
However, it's not a standard.

733
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,950
There's no standard for Zero Trust.

734
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,300
This document is great but
it describes the strategies,

735
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,360
it talks about the importance

736
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,179
and how government programs are adapting.

737
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,540
But it doesn't say, "Hey,
you must design it this way."

738
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,420
So yes, it kinda gives a few
hints about some specifics,

739
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,650
talks about things like
micro segmentation,

740
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,010
and a few other little
crumbs that are there.

741
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,629
But it talks about the philosophy
part, which is correct,

742
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,670
'cause that's what's Zero Trust is.

743
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,730
But unfortunately, uses
the term architecture,

744
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,740
which gets me skeptical.

745
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,890
So it's more of an approach and a strategy

746
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,950
that a true architecture

747
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,780
is what you are going to do
using Zero Trust concepts,

748
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,753
but using some more specific
things that are within there.

749
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,850
So here's the big pillar.

750
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,659
So this is one of those AhaSlides.

751
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,320
So I had that sort of
AhaSlide before about XDR.

752
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,740
This is your Zero Trust AhaSlide.

753
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,220
And this one is going to
be saying that identities,

754
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,140
yes, there has to be multi
factor authentication.

755
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,610
IEM is one of the pillars in Zero Trust.

756
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,469
Restricting network access
is one of the other pillars

757
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:19,510
and application safe lifting

758
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,970
or just saying what's
good and what's not good.

759
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,800
That's a key element as well.

760
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,180
So those are some of the pillars.

761
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,630
So it's not all about identity only

762
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,077
that if somebody says,

763
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,710
"Zero Trust is all about identity,"

764
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,070
and that's one of sort of the
bad sort of memes or ideas

765
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,780
that's going around now, that's not true.

766
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,550
Nor is it all about micro segmentation,

767
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,129
you can't get all of your Zero Trust

768
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,720
through micro segmentation.

769
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,917
But what you start to understand

770
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,179
and I start to understand now

771
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,850
is that Zero Trust towards getting a goal

772
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,000
or as a philosophy, you
can do all of these things,

773
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,750
the things that we're kind of
missing now around identity,

774
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,050
good segmentation, the
like, those are all missing.

775
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,373
And these are approaches towards that.

776
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,370
But one of the specifics are,

777
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,699
we're saying that there are
specific things we can do

778
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,720
aside from those sort of
those individual pillars

779
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,317
is that we can link
those together and say,

780
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:14,490
"Hey," for example, for SaaS apps,

781
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,880
we can do things differently.

782
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,460
We've always had CASBs
and secure web gateways.

783
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,100
Yeah, we've had those and
saying those are Zero Trust,

784
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,250
yeah, that's helpful towards doing that,

785
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,610
because like a CASB or the
Cloud App Security broker

786
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,159
will help you configure
your cloud stuff better.

787
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,710
And that's a Zero Trust goal,

788
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,990
like a well configured cloud environment.

789
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,270
But just saying that Zero
Trust is not good enough.

790
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,277
Let's link these together and say that,

791
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:43,507
"Hey, specifically for
these remote workers

792
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:47,247
"and this new kind of virtual
networking we bought now,

793
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:51,010
"beyond VPN, there's a concept
or an approach called ZTNA."

794
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,247
And it's actually more
of a product saying that,

795
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:56,940
"Hey, this is now the new
generation of VPNs we've got."

796
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,990
ZTNA is going to provide that.

797
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,420
So as the infrastructure changes,

798
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,400
your pipes and security
should change with you.

799
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,110
So hey, that sounds more Zero Trusty

800
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,350
than just a good old VPN.

801
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,669
So when you combine those, ZTNA
and the CASB stuff together,

802
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,770
you get now some specific stuff

803
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,360
around what Zero Trust can provide.

804
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,010
So this is under one term called SASE.

805
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,400
Another termed ZTE or Zero Trust Edge,

806
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,340
they mean the same thing.

807
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,860
And that is saying that
taking these traditional ways

808
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,419
of doing security safeguards,

809
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,570
putting them into this new

810
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,429
kind of flexible network environment,

811
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,940
that gives you some good
security at the edge.

812
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,670
So with this sort of COVID-19 workforce

813
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,930
and why we're talking about
Zero Trust so much now

814
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,240
is because of this.

815
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,150
Often we're talking more about SASE

816
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,460
than we are talking
about really Zero Trust,

817
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,293
but they're together.

818
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,439
SASE is a subset of Zero Trust.

819
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,120
So that's a really important understanding

820
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,639
to say that Zero Trust is the concept,

821
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,840
SASE is the implementation and
uses specific implementations

822
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,919
around VPN, CASB secure web gateways.

823
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,320
So be very cautious about
SASE watching or ZTE watching,

824
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,973
about the secure edge stuff.

825
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,610
It's early days now.

826
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,940
So part of your skepticism

827
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,070
should be that nobody has a soup to nuts

828
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,790
Zero Trust solution.

829
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,087
So I'm skeptical about saying,

830
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,300
"Hey, just come and buy other stuff.

831
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,480
"You're gonna get that."

832
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,820
Much innovation and evolutions ahead.

833
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,050
We're gonna go through
these really quickly

834
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,230
because we've covered
some of these concepts.

835
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,810
But what we're really talking to a lot

836
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,820
and what Zero Trust now is this difference

837
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,090
between managed and unmanaged.

838
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,870
So the unmanaged stuff
is a trust issue, right?

839
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,219
We have unmanaged devices

840
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,049
going out to unsanctioned SaaS apps,

841
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,510
that's the thing we can't see today.

842
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,870
And that is the kind of
stuff we want to try to solve

843
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,656
and get more trust in saying that,

844
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,567
"Yes, we're gonna trust it

845
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,536
"because it's just out in the cloud

846
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:50,889
"or we have a managed device."

847
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,199
That's not good enough
because a managed device,

848
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,429
we only see one side of it.

849
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,710
And the same for if we have a
good sort of corporate app up

850
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,710
in the cloud and it's going
to an unmanaged device.

851
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,220
Well, yes, we can get
part of that through SASE,

852
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,770
for example, but not all of it.

853
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,320
So just the cloud stuff
is not good enough.

854
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,180
We need to know as part
of Zero Trust as well

855
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,640
whether our users device
applications healthy.

856
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,549
And that health

857
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,950
is not just sort of a
normal vulnerability thing.

858
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,509
It's gotta be the history of it.

859
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,120
And this is what we're talking newly

860
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,240
to now about is posture
and sort of risk insights

861
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,968
into Zero Trust.

862
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:27,353
So if you're talking about
a Zero Trust solution,

863
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:30,067
it's not just gonna be, "Hey,
we're gonna drop this solution

864
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:30,900
"into the network."

865
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,240
No, that's not good enough.

866
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,479
The health of that in
the posture over time

867
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,060
and continuously is really
a Zero Trust concept.

868
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,170
Now if we start to link that back to XDR,

869
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,110
what we've been talking about as well,

870
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,610
that link starts to be on clearancing.

871
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,870
Yes, for me to have true Zero
Trust in this environment,

872
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,509
I have to have a rich kind of XDR

873
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,430
or a lot of data security
and kinds of security data

874
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,940
to base this on because
I need that over history.

875
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,880
And there may be conversations
going on and history

876
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,560
that may be outside the normal scope,

877
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,140
and I'm gonna have to
reach and grab for it

878
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,589
in unusual places, but if I had that

879
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,230
and I can perform backward analysis on it,

880
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,847
that's gonna get me towards
a true posture to say,

881
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,867
"Yes, my identity was
good when I signed in,

882
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:14,920
"but it's looking sketchy now

883
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,800
"with all the things I've been doing."

884
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
And this sort of posture
and health over time,

885
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,750
we've kind of had nibbles of,

886
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,440
but now we really need do
this and by linking together

887
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,870
or taking what we have in XDR to do that

888
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,410
and applying it in XDR,

889
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,149
I think now we're getting
the links that are valuable.

890
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,960
But it has to be real XDR and
it's gotta be real Zero Trust,

891
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,810
it can't just be Zero Trust watching.

892
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,650
And then there's work
from home environment,

893
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,653
as we talked about as well.

894
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:43,609
When you go to the data center,

895
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,150
and again, it's an amber connection here

896
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,240
because it's been difficult.

897
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,779
And when we go beyond the VPN,

898
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,010
the reason we're talking
about linking STUN to do this

899
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,890
and doing it as part of Zero Trust,

900
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,230
and specifically as part of SASE,

901
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,550
is saying that, yes, if
the environment changes

902
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,250
between me, if I'm in an STUN environment

903
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,203
or an STUN environment, it
has to be able to adapt to it.

904
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,910
And, specifically, actually
I'm just gonna back up

905
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,743
for a second.

906
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:15,900
This adaptation is really important.

907
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,610
And unfortunately, some of the definitions

908
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,980
around what SASE, Zero
Trust, and ZTE have been

909
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,813
is they're throwing in

910
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:24,620
some of the network technologies into it.

911
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,490
So I'm very skeptical of that.

912
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,310
So be careful if a Zero Trust solution

913
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,500
is talking too much about STUN.

914
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,120
Because to me STUN is part of the problem,

915
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,447
saying, "Hey, look, yes,
it's a new challenge.

916
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:36,887
"It's a good thing and
there's new opportunities.

917
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,767
"But it's what we have to accommodate,

918
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:42,259
"not what has to be part of the security."

919
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,930
So my Zero Trust, my SASE

920
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,520
should accommodate and
embrace an STUN environment,

921
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,180
but it doesn't mean I have
to own the STUN necessarily.

922
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,009
So be very skeptical about STUN solutions

923
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,483
being sold as Zero
Trust solutions as well.

924
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,960
The terminology as we mentioned,

925
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,660
there's equivalents depending
on who they're termed by,

926
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,540
but they mean the same thing.

927
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,410
So when we're talking
about Zero Trust, SASE,

928
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,839
we start to bring in the endpoints

929
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,170
as they play this more
important role on the edge.

930
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,780
This is where these terms
get thrown around a lot.

931
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,360
But they effectively mean the same thing.

932
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,780
And we've given that good diagram

933
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,270
of what we think SASE really means.

934
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,990
That is not interchangeable in Zero Trust.

935
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,549
It's a subset of it, and
it's specifically about

936
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,880
that people and stuff

937
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,830
outside the enterprise edge connecting.

938
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,600
And again, be really cautious of CASBs,

939
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,250
or secure gateways being just
sort of Zero Trust watched.

940
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,000
So for it to be truly SASE,

941
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,540
it's gotta have that
working no matter where

942
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,620
and that VPN or ZTNA, that's
just the connectivity service.

943
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,240
ZTNA on its own doesn't give you much.

944
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,899
There's a new sort of VPN
except a more flexible

945
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,743
and smart VPN, which supports
better security goals.

946
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,870
So again, Greg Young, thank
you very much for this session

947
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,400
and your attendance here,

948
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,410
and I look forward to speaking with you

949
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,740
in the future, thanks
