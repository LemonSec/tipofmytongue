00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,280
- [Announcer] Please welcome the CEO of Apiiro,

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,012
Idan Plotnik.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,540
- Software development is the core driver

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,800
of business growth,

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,920
and organizations are being held back,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
because DevSecOps, cloud security,
and risk management tools

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,630
lack of understanding of risk

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,000
from design to code to cloud.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,430
Prioritizing risks across changes is hard,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,800
because risk is multidimensional.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,489
Consider a user story that
requires collecting new data,

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,800
and the developer that changed the logic

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,422
of an internet facing API,

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,610
and EdsPPI to an internet facing,

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,640
to a business impact application.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
The security expertise
of the developer matters.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,110
The same is true for
pull request discussions,

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,950
cloud infrastructure changes,

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,190
and authorization controls
in the API gateways.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,210
These are all critical
pieces of information

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,809
needed to evaluate the risk of a change.

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,363
And no one is looking at them.

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,980
Before Apiiro, it was impossible

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,580
to connect the dots from
design to code to cloud,

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,210
because the tools lack of risk visibility

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,559
across on-prem and cloud applications.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,100
Decisions have been made too late

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,929
with many other processes

30
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,540
and fragmentation across many tools,

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,590
and a ratio of one security architect

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,590
to 159 developers who all
generate multiple changes a day.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,820
To release these changes for production,

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,470
dev teams needs to go
through threat models,

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,520
security and compliance
reviews, pen-tests,

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,100
triaged noisy alerts,
and risk assessments,

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,470
which are manual and inaccurate.

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,570
Expecting a single
architect to review hundreds

39
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,259
of changes a day and
decides which are risky

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,673
is asking the impossible.

41
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,670
Apiiro is reinventing the
security development lifecycle

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,060
for agile and cloud native development.

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,260
And it's hard, because you
must add context to code

44
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,209
from design to production.

45
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,900
We use NLP machine
learning and UVB concepts

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,020
to analyze application open source

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,740
and infrastructure as code,

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,080
text from user stories,
developer knowledge,

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,260
data from third-party
tools and business impact.

50
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,660
We empower dev, security,
and compliance teams

51
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,210
deliver faster while
reducing costs and risk

52
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,413
all in one platform.

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,110
The Apiiro Code Risk Platform provides

54
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,030
a real time application inventory,

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,210
an action of a remediation work plan,

56
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,350
an adoptive governance engine,

57
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,420
automated remediation workflows,

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,899
and CACD attack prevention

59
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,260
like the one used in solar winds

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,510
and abnormal developer behavior.

61
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,670
Apiiro is led by serial entrepreneurs

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,480
and top tier investors.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,649
We launched in October

64
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,460
and already have over 40 customers.

65
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,040
We are at the intersection

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,010
of DevSecOps cloud
security risk management,

67
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,450
which combines to a $100 billion market.

68
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,670
DevSecOps and cloud security are failing

69
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,420
to become a business enabler.

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,171
We must move to a
multidimensional risk management.

71
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:20,412

72
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:25,413
