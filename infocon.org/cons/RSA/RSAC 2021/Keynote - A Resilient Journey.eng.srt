1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(music)

2
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:18,296
(music)

3
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:25,130
- It is indeed quite a hill we must climb,

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,820
and our recent times
have certainly felt dark.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,610
To the security teams,
analysts, engineers, investors,

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,400
and media tuning in from
around the world, welcome.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,810
I hope you and your families
are safe and healthy.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,950
It's been 15 months since we met,

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,250
right before the pandemic
stopped the world in its tracks.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,210
And in that time,
countless doctors, nurses,

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,480
and other first responders
have been brave enough

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,879
to be the light for all of us.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,310
They've worked tirelessly to save lives,

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,080
and we owe them our gratitude.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,640
I also want to express my deepest thanks

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,340
to each of you, our
digital first responders.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,230
When everything was upended, you made sure

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,180
that kids could still log
into their classrooms,

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,180
researchers could collaborate on vaccines,

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,603
and governments could
serve their citizens.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,110
Though I'd prefer to
thank you all in person,

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,170
virtual formats like this
symbolize the year we've had,

23
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,170
the adaptations we've had to make,

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,170
and the theme of RSA
Conference 2021, resilience.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,580
So how has that theme played
out over the last year?

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,789
In 2020, we experienced the first death

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,900
attributable to a cyber attack;

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,380
a global software supply chain attack

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,149
with a blast radius affecting
at least 18,000 organizations;

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,150
social media accounts belonging
to former presidents, CEOs,

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,913
and celebrities compromised
by, no less, a 17 year old.

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,763
These stumbles might suggest
that we are not very resilient.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,320
A counter-argument,
though, is we fended off

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,150
the largest distributed
denial-of-service attack

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,610
ever recorded, at 2.3 terabits per second,

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,720
and protected the safety
of our water supply.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,900
While we have certainly fallen down,

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,310
every time we have fallen,
we have gotten back up.

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,140
So aren't we pretty resilient after all?

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,339
Ultimately, being resilient
is not good enough;

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,500
we must be good at resilience.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,333
But are we?

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,429
Let's start by defining resilience.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,420
Resilience isn't just about
getting up when you fall.

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,950
To be good at it, we must fall less often,

46
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,762
withstand the fall better, and
rise up stronger every time.

47
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,920
So over the next few minutes,

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,869
I will walk through three
ideas for us to consider

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,650
in order to get better in
our resilience journey.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,440
So what on earth do tigers,
airplanes, and sewing machines

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,890
have to do with cyber resilience?

52
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,833
Let's find out.

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,640
March 2020 was unforgettable.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,690
It brought the start of the lockdown

55
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,359
and the premiere of "Tiger King".

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,520
34 million people watched "Tiger
King" in its first 10 days.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,270
Eventually, 64 million
households would tune in.

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,750
That's an incredible surge,
and it got me thinking:

59
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,970
how does Netflix ensure that
its 203 million subscribers

60
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,453
can stream whatever they
want whenever they want it?

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,730
Netflix does not fall down often:

62
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,822
less than 30 seconds a week.

63
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,080
In 2011, Netflix was
preparing to move its content

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,200
from the data center to the cloud.

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,410
The new availability and performance

66
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,630
were critical to user experience,

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,780
and they had to design a
fault-tolerant architecture

68
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,760
within an environment
they didn't fully control.

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,340
So they invented something
called Chaos Monkey.

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,420
Imagine a monkey shutting
down production instances

71
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,833
and chewing through cables
in your data center.

72
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,120
By bringing in and building in chaos,

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,050
this tool accounted for
a common type of failure

74
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,209
and ensured graceful
degradation and survival

75
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,349
without any customer impact.

76
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,680
In fact, simulating chaos worked so well,

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,860
it inspired the creation
of the Netflix Simian Army,

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,770
a collection of tools to
help prepare for chaos:

79
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,530
the latency monkey, conformity monkey,

80
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,989
and, yes, for sure, security monkey.

81
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,640
It's that kind of engineering
that has helped Netflix

82
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,050
build a resilient and successful business,

83
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,010
and ensured we could
all binge "Tiger King".

84
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,300
Chaos is a pretty good way

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,923
to describe our context in cybersecurity:

86
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,280
boundless, complex, hyper-connected

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,429
and dynamic tech stacks
sitting on multiple clouds;

88
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,763
workloads that move about everywhere;

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,840
machine and human actors working,

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,070
playing, learning from anywhere;

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,930
and the added randomness
of malicious actors

92
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,920
trying to disrupt, steal,
subvert, and instill fear.

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,910
How can you secure chaos?

94
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,790
You can't, you don't.

95
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,750
You focus on resilience
by embracing chaos.

96
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,320
How?

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,320
One, expect the unexpected;
two, trust no one;

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,940
and three, compartmentalize failure zones.

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,390
In cybersecurity, to practice chaos

100
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,140
and reliability engineering,

101
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,669
teams should constantly assess
and test their responses.

102
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,830
Attack your own network and see
if you recorded that attack,

103
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,099
because if you don't have visibility,

104
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,250
then you don't know what to defend.

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,200
And once you do have visibility,

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,430
use threat intelligence to understand

107
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,050
your vertical's likeliest antagonists,

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,130
including their methods.

109
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,510
And then in addition to
modeling the likeliest attack,

110
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,590
make sure to throw in a few unlikely ones

111
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,722
in your red and blue team exercise.

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,230
Zero trust was always important,

113
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,450
but in the post-COVID
work-from-anywhere-always world,

114
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,890
it is an imperative.

115
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,729
It is a mindset, not just an architecture.

116
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,530
Micro-segmentation, providing
layer seven threat prevention,

117
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,549
and risk-based continuous
multifactor authentication

118
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,860
are critical components,
but most important of all

119
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,310
is to limit trust to what
is absolutely required

120
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,090
and never elevate trust
based on unreliable factors.

121
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,229
The global system for mobile
communications predicts

122
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,280
that IoT connections will reach

123
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,190
almost 25 billion globally by 2025,

124
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,980
and that might be an underestimation

125
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,360
based on the traction of 5G.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,100
By some estimates, we are
connecting 127 devices

127
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,330
to the internet every second.

128
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,479
And it's not just connected devices,

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,210
it's connected organizations

130
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,210
and the private data flowing
through this value chain.

131
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,719
Companies increasingly
rely on third parties

132
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,130
and on average share confidential
and sensitive information

133
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,430
with approximately 583 third parties.

134
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,120
Yet only a third keep a
comprehensive inventory

135
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,290
of these third parties.

136
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,830
Too many dominoes stacked
too tightly together.

137
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,870
Look, we can ensure that
each domino remains upright.

138
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,080
Instead, we have to
space them farther apart.

139
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,460
What does that mean?

140
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,030
Implement third party risk assessments

141
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,729
to map your organizational business graph

142
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,360
to get a vectorized view of risk.

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,870
Implement network segmentation
and least privilege

144
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,100
not just in east-west scenarios
or southbound traffic,

145
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,240
but northbound as well.

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,330
It's like wearing a mask.

147
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,280
We should wear one not
just to protect ourselves,

148
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,852
but to protect others.

149
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,340
What if the SolarWinds servers

150
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,880
were only allowed to
talk to the known good,

151
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,450
rather than being disallowed
to connect to the known bad?

152
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,400
Could the Twitter hack have been avoided

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,409
if the employees had not been trusted

154
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,520
to change the email addresses of accounts?

155
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,282
By being prepared for chaos,
we will fall less often.

156
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,969
But despite our best efforts,

157
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,750
at some point along our
journey, the terrain will shift,

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,883
the ground will catch our
feet, and we will stumble.

159
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,332
This next section is about
withstanding the fall.

160
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
In World War Two, the Allies faced

161
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,849
a version of this problem.

162
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,990
They needed to minimize
damage to their aircraft

163
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,169
in order to keep them flying.

164
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,689
They worked with a statistician

165
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,730
named Abraham Wald from
Columbia University

166
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,500
who examined damaged aircraft

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,690
that had returned from missions.

168
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,650
He saw where the bullets had hit,

169
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,699
and used those patterns to recommend

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,783
where engineers should
place additional armor.

171
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,550
Before Wald, the military assumed

172
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,303
that they should reinforce the
areas drawing the most fire.

173
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,020
But after looking at the damage,

174
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,470
Wald made a counterintuitive
recommendation:

175
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,830
place the extra armor in the areas

176
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,400
that showed the least damage.

177
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,550
Why?

178
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,390
The aircraft that Wald
examined may have been damaged,

179
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,560
but had returned safely to base.

180
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
The unscarred areas had been enough

181
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,233
to carry the plane back home.

182
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,640
Wald's remarkable insight bears
an important lesson for us.

183
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,490
Today, we are confronted

184
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,260
with a modern version of Wald's problem:

185
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,600
there's only so much armor to go around,

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,590
and too much armor can slow us down.

187
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,600
We are all working with limited resources,

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
so we have to prioritize intelligently.

189
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,130
We have to protect the areas

190
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,730
that represent the greatest risks,

191
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,260
not where we see the most holes.

192
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,030
NIST Cybersecurity Framework
does an excellent job

193
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,470
of proposing a risk-based
approach to cyber.

194
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,050
Here is what DHS Secretary Mayorkas

195
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,900
had to say about resilience.

196
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,510
- Pursuing cyber resilience
requires a third principle,

197
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,300
namely a focus on a risk-based approach.

198
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,560
Determining what risks to prioritize

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,050
and how to allocate limited resources

200
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,113
is crucial to maximizing
the government's impact.

201
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,840
- The US government faces
many cyber missions,

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,370
and in 2020, CISA ascertained

203
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,600
that the US presidential election

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,710
was foundational to our democracy

205
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,290
and we needed to put more armor there.

206
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,780
By prioritizing it, CISA protected

207
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,089
the cyber aspects of the election.

208
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,090
Every organization, not
just the federal government,

209
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,490
needs to deploy an integrated
risk management solution,

210
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,150
and implement methods
to quantify all risk,

211
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,290
including cyber risk.

212
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,980
Since the cyber onslaught is unrelenting,

213
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,160
we cannot review all that happens.

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,680
We simply don't have enough human cycles

215
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,160
to prioritize cyber incidents.

216
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,160
We need to leverage the
superpower of the cloud,

217
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,699
and apply machine learning and AI

218
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,290
to implement artificial prioritization,

219
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,699
AI to analyze incidents and
prioritize them for response.

220
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,730
Extended detection and
response, or XDR solutions,

221
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,400
that bring all the data from
the entire attack surface,

222
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,400
network, endpoint, cloud,
IoT, et cetera, into one place

223
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,960
and leverage cloud-based analytics

224
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,133
is a recipe for artificial prioritization.

225
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,949
By prioritizing based on risk

226
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,290
and protecting what matters most,

227
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,372
we will ensure that when we
fall, we will withstand it.

228
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,160
The third aspect of resilience

229
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,930
is rising up stronger
when we inevitably fall.

230
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,030
So let's review a story

231
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,930
about sewing machines to understand this.

232
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,770
The Self Employed Women's
Association, or SEWA,

233
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,170
supports nearly 2
million low-income women,

234
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,939
their families, and their
communities in India.

235
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,790
The pandemic and India's lockdown

236
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,983
have been particularly hard for SEWA.

237
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,680
But after 49 years of helping
its members persevere,

238
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,150
SEWA knows the powerful
role a community plays

239
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,709
in responding to a crisis.

240
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,820
When the lockdown forced everyone indoors,

241
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,930
women from across SEWA turned
to their sewing machines

242
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,489
to make masks for government officials,

243
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,180
hospitals, and their families.

244
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,390
As India braves the second
wave of the pandemic,

245
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,430
SEWA and other organizations
around the world

246
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,260
continue to play a critical
role in provisioning oxygen,

247
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,490
plasma, money, and other supplies.

248
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,820
If you have the means,

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,450
I ask that you consider
supporting their efforts.

250
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,820
The SEWA story shows that those
that belong to a community

251
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,993
rise up stronger because
they rise up together.

252
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,110
In cyber security, I have often stated

253
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,640
we must be inclusive to
nurture and grow our community.

254
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,170
We need to bring not just
the security professionals

255
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,569
but IT and business as
well into our community.

256
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,700
We need to find a way to attract

257
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,190
diverse and neurodiverse talent.

258
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,190
For 30 years, RSA Conference
has helped us do just that.

259
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,170
Today, we have broader
participation, deeper sharing,

260
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,683
and wider representation than ever before.

261
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,700
We seek your continued engagement

262
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,320
as we reimagine the conference
for the post-COVID world

263
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,843
with hybrid events and a year-round model.

264
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,290
Today, I also implore us to consider

265
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,563
another idea to grow our community.

266
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,510
This is Marcus Hutchins.

267
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,420
When he was nine, Marcus took
apart his family's computer

268
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,750
and the code that operated it.

269
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,730
At 14, he created a password stealer.

270
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,680
At 15, he ran a botnet of more
than 8,000 hacked computers.

271
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,800
And then in 2017, he was the individual

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,729
that found the kill switch
for the WannaCry worm,

273
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,450
saving the internet.

274
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,000
It wasn't a straight and
narrow path for Marcus,

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,740
though he eventually worked his way

276
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,173
into a legitimate cybersecurity carrier.

277
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,200
He was on the dark side,
but became a gray hatter.

278
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,810
In 2017, he was arrested and faced a trial

279
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,979
for his past misdeeds.

280
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,090
The judge's lenient sentence

281
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,290
acknowledged his remarkable contribution.

282
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,390
This was an act of inclusion
and profound wisdom

283
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,850
that shows us that we need to find a way

284
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,130
to never give up on bright minds

285
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,433
and attract them into our community.

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,853
We need to recruit better
than the adversary.

287
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,880
Our community has shown
remarkable solidarity

288
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,650
when one of us falls.

289
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,380
We may have competition
within the community,

290
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,730
but we have each other's back.

291
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,850
We are getting better
at sharing and learning,

292
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,890
so when one of us falls, all of us learn.

293
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,400
We all rise up stronger.

294
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,850
In 2020, we saw cyber incidents

295
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,090
of unprecedented scale and scope.

296
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,560
But let's note that we
have not yet encountered

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,430
a global cyber pandemic.

298
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,790
Hard as our journey may seem,

299
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,540
we have not been fully tested
yet, and must remain vigilant.

300
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,219
The next leg of a long
journey is just beginning.

301
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,660
There will certainly be
challenges, stumbles, and failures.

302
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,870
But I hope that these three examples

303
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,570
and the stories behind them

304
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,000
will inspire us to go the distance.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,990
We can do so by preparing for
chaos, prioritizing smartly,

306
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,800
and leveraging the power of our community.

307
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,089
Tigers, airplanes, sewing machines.

308
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,770
And if we do so, we will fall less often,

309
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,370
withstand the fall when we
do, and rise up stronger.

310
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,773
We will get better at resilience.

311
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,949
So let me leave you with one last image

312
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,100
to carry on your journey.

313
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,910
Kintsugi is Japanese for
golden seams or golden repair.

314
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,760
It is the art of using
gold lacquers and resins

315
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,470
to restore broken pottery and ceramics.

316
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,630
But kintsugi does more than
restore, it transforms.

317
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,253
It doesn't hide falls and
breaks, it highlights them.

318
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,920
The golden wound becomes a celebration

319
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,540
of the hands that put
things back together,

320
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,130
a celebration of the purposefulness

321
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,340
and learning from the process,

322
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,560
a celebration of resilience.

323
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,900
So friends, take some time this week

324
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,853
