1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,389
- Hello, and welcome to CISO leadership,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,000
building your personal action plan.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,100
My name is Frank Kim.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,140
I'm a fellow at the SANS Institute.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,080
I also have my own security consulting

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,610
and CISO advisory practice
under the ThinkSec umbrella.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,939
And as I was getting
ready for this session,

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,030
I found myself reflecting
back on my first day

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,900
as a CISO in a new organization.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,640
And I remember thinking
to myself, well, what now?

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,880
And as a security leader,
it's easy to get distracted

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,019
mired in the details,
the everyday emergencies

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,700
that seemingly never end.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,030
I've experienced this far too many times.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,600
And I've seen it even more before.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,780
For example, one of my
clients who I helped

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,160
with their strategic roadmap
had a hard time making progress

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,080
because they remained
overwhelmed with the urgent,

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,460
but not important items.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,100
So to be successful and
effective in your role,

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,850
you need to take a step back
and focus on the bigger ideas.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,313
This means building a
practical, personal action plan.

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,260
So what are the important items?

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,000
If you're advancing your
career, it's important to hear

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,890
what has, and what hasn't
worked for other leaders

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,540
even experienced CISOs
often need a reminder

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,540
of how to turn common sense
techniques into common practice.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,850
I find myself for getting
this all the time.

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,979
I need to remind myself, hey
how do I turn that common sense

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,230
into common practice?

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,260
And as cybersecurity continues to mature,

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,520
it's even more important that you

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,740
as a modern security leader in CISO,

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,830
learn to lead transformation
for your team,

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,390
your organization, and
ultimately yourself.

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,220
Today, we're gonna talk about
some tools and techniques

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,610
that are shown here to help
you overcome these challenges

38
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,890
building your team,
transforming your program,

39
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,420
and getting you ready to
advance in your career.

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,433
So let's go ahead and take
these three items one at a time.

41
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,789
First, in terms of transforming your team,

42
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,790
you're only as successful as your team.

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,410
So let's talk about some of the ways

44
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,942
that you can help them be successful.

45
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,850
First, we have what we
call this CISO Mind Map,

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,600
and I'm gonna do a quick
shout out to Rafeeq Rehman

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,560
who has for years been
publishing a CISO Mind Map

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,260
on his website that you
can see available here.

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,840
Now, this is our version of
the SANS Institute version

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,310
of the CISO Mind Map that
used, that we based on Rafeeq's

51
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,840
Mind Map with permission.

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,270
And we went around and we asked

53
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,260
a bunch of CISOs, security leaders

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,850
others in the industry
and said, hey what is it?

55
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,070
That not only you as a security leader,

56
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,690
but what do you as a moderate
security leader in CISO

57
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,340
actually do every single day?

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,472
And we're not gonna go over
all of the details here

59
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:51,740
in this Mind Map today, but
just by glancing at this,

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,730
you can see in this diagram,
in the upper left-hand corner

61
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,209
we've got security operations.

62
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,690
What are the things that
you as a security manager

63
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,109
and leader do to prevent, detect, respond

64
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,550
to various issues that arise?

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,190
Well that is certainly still
a huge and important part

66
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,609
of what we do in our security programs,

67
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,060
but you can see that
there is a whole spectrum

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,980
of other domains that we now
have to be knowledgeable about

69
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,550
so that we can drive leadership
in these various areas.

70
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,400
And if you look down towards
the right hand corner

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,870
of this slide, you can
see not only do we have

72
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,620
security culture, but we have
various leadership skills

73
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,620
and competencies that you
the modern security leader

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,900
need to be knowledgeable about to be able

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,370
to turn these things from common
sense into common practice.

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,970
And some of the items here in
the lower right hand corner

77
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,140
are the things that we're
going to be focusing on today

78
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,333
in this session.

79
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:49,300
Now, as you are listening
to this at any time,

80
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,570
if you have any questions,
feel free to go ahead

81
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,160
and type them into the chat
window and we will respond.

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,913
I'll respond as we
progress in this session.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,940
So with that as a little bit of backdrop

84
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,398
in terms of what is it that
security team, security programs

85
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,579
need to actually get done?

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,870
Well, what about from a
security leadership perspective?

87
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,950
Here, we've got what we call
our security leadership matrix

88
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,619
and you can see that this is divided

89
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,040
into three primary columns.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,430
Now I will say that you've probably seen

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,200
versions of this chart, this matrix,

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,060
in various places online.

93
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,750
I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say that this chart

94
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,630
is 50% better than the other
charts that you've seen online.

95
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
And well, there's a couple
of reasons for this,

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,340
is one, a good friend
of mine, Janie Bunnell.

97
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,380
She really came up with
this version of the chart

98
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,980
and it is I think, 50% better
'cause the ones you see online

99
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,060
only have two columns.

100
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,050
They only have the manager
and the leader column.

101
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,040
Whereas this one, of
course, has the boss column,

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,520
as you see here.

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,289
And if you only have the two
columns, there's maybe perhaps

104
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,810
a little bit of a implication that,

105
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,710
hey, somehow management
is lesser than leadership.

106
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,280
I definitely don't think so.

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,239
You've gotta have both
management and leadership skills,

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,645
but what you want to temper

109
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:09,549
are some of those boss characteristics

110
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,100
that you see in this
first major column here.

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,530
And we've probably all
worked for that person,

112
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,409
that micromanager, that
looks at every single detail

113
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,610
and you finish some work
that they asked for,

114
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,950
and they were very prescriptive

115
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,700
about what exactly they wanted.

116
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,800
And you bring that work
back to them and the boss

117
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,240
invariably says, well, yeah, Frank,

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,990
that wasn't what I was looking for.

119
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,710
I actually want you to
do this, this and this.

120
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,440
And eventually over time
that boss that micromanager

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,230
starts to just do the work themselves.

122
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,330
And this is of course
very demoralizing, right?

123
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,729
Because the boss really
tries to drive people,

124
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,120
tries to command, tries to do
all of the work for themselves

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
in terms of controlling, dictating

126
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,360
how things should actually be done.

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,440
Well, from a leadership
perspective, right?

128
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,560
What does the manager do?

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Well, the manager, right, well focuses on

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,650
not just dictating, but
telling, establishing

131
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,840
the environment, managing work,

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,020
trying to get roadblocks out of the way,

133
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,190
and leaders on the other
hand go a little bit further

134
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,550
and say, okay, well, what do
we need to do to influence,

135
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,260
to sell, to create a shared
vision that everybody

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,490
could buy into?

137
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,670
And depending on the situation certainly,

138
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,900
you're gonna have to exhibit
some of these different skills

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,400
in some of these different columns.

140
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,500
And so that's what we wanna
touch on today in terms

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,550
of how you can actually
go about doing this.

142
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,440
Now, this brings us to a really great book

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,127
by Patrick Lencioni called,

144
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,740
"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team."

145
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,530
And this book is really
a leadership fable.

146
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,619
If you haven't read it
before, highly recommend

147
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,340
that you check this out.

148
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,440
Now, this book really fun
read, really quick read

149
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
because it is written in story form

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,660
at that leadership table.

151
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,100
Now, there are five different
slices to this pyramid here

152
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,927
in terms of things that
Patrick Lencioni says,

153
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,110
"Really create dysfunctions
within a team."

154
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,610
And let's go ahead and start
at the top of the pyramid here.

155
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,120
First, we've got inattention
to results when people

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,250
tend to be a little bit selfish and focus

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,900
on their own personal
successes over team successes.

158
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,919
I'm sure you've seen this before,
but we also have avoidance

159
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,560
of accountability when people,
they aren't held accountable

160
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,300
for their lack of production
or inattention to results,

161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,520
or their counterproductive behavior.

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
Unfortunately, I've seen
this right that one person

163
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,290
on the team that no matter what
just doesn't seem to perform

164
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,000
or doesn't seem to want to perform.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,920
And right below that, the middle slice.

166
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,990
We've got lack of
commitment where people say

167
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,360
that they're actually bought in,

168
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,480
but they might perhaps engage
in some passive aggressive

169
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,380
behavior that makes it
hard for work to progress,

170
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,750
makes things a little bit more ambiguous.

171
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,420
I've seen this firsthand
when you've got engineers,

172
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,460
security engineers, that
new product is brought in

173
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,489
and they don't, for some
reason like this product

174
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,880
they preferred another product

175
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,570
that they actually wanted to use.

176
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,200
So they might act passively to
delay the project or at worst

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,830
sabotage it in terms of
this lack of commitment.

178
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,190
But you also have fear of conflict.

179
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,500
Now you see that we're
getting down towards the base

180
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,553
of the pyramid here, right?

181
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:23,090
Some of these foundational
issues that are really the seeds

182
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,539
of why teams can't perform well.

183
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,950
And fear of conflict is
really this inability

184
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,039
to address issues and
provide constructive feedback

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,120
because well, people are
scared of the backlash

186
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,429
they might receive.

187
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,219
For example, one of my team
members explicitly says

188
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,260
that, he finds it extremely difficult

189
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,250
to have any type of
challenging conversation.

190
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,950
And because he finds
it extremely difficult,

191
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,670
he will yes, avoid those
challenging conversations.

192
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,240
Well, if you avoid all
challenging conversations,

193
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,560
well, the team can never grow.

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,930
You can never grow as an individual.

195
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,989
Finally, notice what is at
the base of the pyramid.

196
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,010
And this is trust, right?

197
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,540
The foundation for, well,
really everything we do,

198
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,230
not only at work, but in our
personal lives here as well

199
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,920
'cause when people can't be vulnerable

200
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,589
with others on the team, you
can't create therefore more

201
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,460
meaningful relationships.

202
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,130
So let's talk a little
bit more about trust

203
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,403
because it is so important.

204
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:25,220
And that brings us to the circle of trust.

205
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,390
What are some of the
different characteristics

206
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,010
that you want to exhibit?

207
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,319
That you want to things
that you want to do

208
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,410
to try to build trust
with your team members?

209
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,680
And let's go ahead and start
in the upper right-hand corner

210
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,560
at the roughly one o'clock
position here, with integrity.

211
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,449
And that is simply saying
what you're going to do

212
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,740
and actually doing it.

213
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,520
Now, right below that
we've got empathy, right?

214
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,579
Really, truly being able to put yourself

215
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,730
into the other person's
shoes, contribution.

216
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,610
Sometimes you need to roll up your sleeves

217
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,670
get your hands dirty,

218
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,839
actually get some of
the work done as well.

219
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,170
Consistency in terms of
showing up every single day

220
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,490
with the same approach, the
same values so that people

221
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,720
actually know what to expect.

222
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,380
Now, transparency.

223
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,360
Now this one is really
important in my mind,

224
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,990
sharing as much information as possible

225
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,040
as I reflect back on my
career or some leaders

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,182
that I worked with, and one
of their most prevalent traits

227
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:30,200
was transparency.

228
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,300
I think, tried to share as
much information as possible.

229
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,270
Well, why?

230
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,490
so that then I would be knowledgeable

231
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,160
about what is going on
the different motivations

232
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,733
of different people,
different organizations

233
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,200
within the company.

234
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,740
And then I would be able
to analyze and therefore

235
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,327
make my own decisions
going forward as well.

236
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:51,460
But look at the top here
at the 12 o'clock position,

237
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,860
we've got honesty being truthful.

238
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,910
And as I all ready said,

239
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,560
for my colleague that's
extremely hard for him to do.

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,530
So, what is something, what
is a tool that we can use

241
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,420
to try to have a little bit
more direct conversations?

242
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, this brings us to
"Radical Candor" by Kim Scott.

243
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Now this is a book that she has written,

244
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,959
and the advice that
she gives in this book,

245
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,550
highly recommend that you check this out,

246
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,620
if you haven't seen this all ready.

247
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,190
And she breaks this up
into a four quadrant grid.

248
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,760
Now I think perhaps many
of you know by experience

249
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,740
that everything great from
a leadership and management

250
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,050
perspective comes in the form

251
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,030
of a four quadrant two by two grid.

252
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,020
But in all seriousness, this
is a really great model here

253
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,890
where she is divided up into two axes.

254
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,720
The X-axis going left to
right is how you communicate.

255
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,100
Do you stay quiet?

256
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,040
Do you stay silent on the left?

257
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,329
All the way to challenging
directly on the right-hand side

258
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,390
and on the Y-axis, top to bottom,

259
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,720
bottom to top you've got,
well, hey, caring personally

260
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,850
about somebody, about the situation,

261
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,610
all the way down at the bottom here too.

262
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,110
Well, maybe not caring at all.

263
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,550
And she says, hey the ideal
place to be of course,

264
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,890
as we know, from most of
these two by two grids

265
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,530
is the upper right-hand corner,

266
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,470
which she describes as radical candor.

267
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,000
Now, if you stay quiet and
you don't care about people

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,890
in the lower left-hand corner,
that leads to a situation

269
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,340
of what she describes as
manipulative insincerity, right?

270
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,200
You say things, but
you're not really sincere

271
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,650
'cause you don't care and
you tend to wanna stay quiet.

272
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,050
However, if you do care
but you are generally

273
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,410
more on the quiet side, this
leads to what she refers to as

274
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,280
ruinous empathy, a too much
empathy without being able

275
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,050
to be candid, that is not
such a great situation either.

276
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,709
And of course, if you are
just very driven by outcomes,

277
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,110
by results, that you
might challenge directly,

278
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,070
but people might take that as obnoxious.

279
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,870
So it's a little bit of a balance here

280
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,650
in terms of this concept
of "radical candor."

281
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,939
Something that elements of
this, you probably wanna try

282
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,963
to incorporate into your work as well.

283
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,540
So in terms of providing feedback,

284
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,560
well what can you actually do?

285
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,500
Here, we've got a couple
of little tools here

286
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,830
so that when you are having
some of these challenging

287
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,290
conversations, when you are preparing

288
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,329
for some of these
challenging conversations

289
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,500
you wanna think back,

290
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,440
how do you go about providing feedback?

291
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,950
Well, you start with the facts.

292
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,090
You remember start with the
facts, this is very important.

293
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,580
Don't start with emotions,

294
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,530
don't start with how it made
you feel, start with the facts.

295
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,020
Hey, you were late to five team meetings

296
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,500
by 10 minutes each, right?

297
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,390
And then you talk about the impact.

298
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,540
How did this impact
other members on the team

299
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,189
and the work that was being done?

300
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,670
Then you pause, you listen for feedback

301
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,729
and depending how the conversation goes,

302
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,510
eventually you will move into a phase

303
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,930
of setting expectations.

304
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,109
Now, remember it's not just
about providing feedback,

305
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,750
it's also about receiving,
receiving feedback and listening.

306
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,940
So on the right hand side,

307
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,330
the sister right to this
model here is, well,

308
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,800
you've got to start by being approachable,

309
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,060
listening, clarifying,
asking clarifying questions,

310
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,979
but notice that in the
lower right hand corner,

311
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,570
that respond is the very last thing

312
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,890
that you're supposed to do.

313
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,740
And a lot of times

314
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,570
especially in the heat
of the moment, right?

315
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,840
Remember common sense to
common practice, right?

316
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,420
We jumped straight to responding.

317
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,180
I've done this numerous
times, I make this mistake

318
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,250
even I would venture to say
every day, even with my kids.

319
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,910
So we wanna try to think,
remind ourself of this model.

320
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,990
Start with the facts and
respond last, listen, right?

321
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,670
To make sure that you
are providing your team

322
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,262
with the right feedback
that they actually need.

323
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,540
So now, with some tools in your tool belt,

324
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,930
to try to get your team into a place,

325
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,400
you also have to ensure

326
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,429
that your security program is sustainable.

327
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,110
I've seen security teams disintegrate

328
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,140
after a few key people leave.

329
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,530
And to combat this, you need
to provide a vision, a mission

330
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,860
for your security program
that is going to endure

331
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,190
beyond specific individuals.

332
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,650
So how do you go about doing this?

333
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,300
Well, you need to keep in mind something

334
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,069
that Douglas McGregor said,
"Most teams aren't teams at all,

335
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,870
but merely collections of
individual relationships

336
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,703
with the boss."

337
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,403
Huh, that sounds familiar,
I've seen that before.

338
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:28,440
Each individual vying
with the others for power,

339
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
prestige and position.

340
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,680
So it is our job as the security leader,

341
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,380
as a security manager, to
try to change this dynamic,

342
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,750
don't make it just about

343
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,323
your team members relationships with you.

344
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,050
Now this gets us to the security vision.

345
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,010
How can you start to think
about your security vision

346
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,420
and try to expand it a little bit?

347
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,967
So another little tool here
that is from Jim Collins' book,

348
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,000
"Good to Great,"

349
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,840
is what he describes as the BHAG,

350
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,640
the big, hairy, audacious goal.

351
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,750
And this is an intersection,
as you can see here

352
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,070
on the right hand side of
three different things,

353
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,670
what are you deeply
passionate about, right?

354
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,120
Maybe it's cybersecurity.

355
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,500
What drives your economic engine?

356
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,250
And what can you be the
best in the world at?

357
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,710
This intersection of this
diagram here is your BHAG

358
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,950
right in the middle.

359
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,630
And you can't choose to
just make this up, right?

360
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,900
It has to be something
that you can be the best

361
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,733
in the world at,

362
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,079
that does drive your
organization's economic engine,

363
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,160
and that you are deeply passionate about.

364
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,140
So as you were thinking about
this vision overall, right?

365
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,850
Once you've got that vision
in place, you wanna make sure

366
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,850
that your team is reminded of
that vision on a regular basis

367
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,849
and from a perspective in
terms of providing value

368
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,390
to your team, to your organization,

369
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,140
well, what do we do every single day

370
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,730
from a security perspective?

371
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,730
And a lot of what we do in
our technical team members do

372
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,020
are the things at the
very bottom of this slide,

373
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,340
learning and growth.

374
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,500
we tend to try to do things
implement tools and processes

375
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,130
and products to create and
maintain the confidentiality,

376
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,000
integrity and availability of our systems.

377
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,540
Now, I'm gonna stretch a little bit here

378
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,040
and say you know what?

379
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,339
Most of the rest of the organization

380
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,829
doesn't care about that, right?

381
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,700
At least directly, what
do they care about?

382
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,849
Well, they care hear about the things

383
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,349
that they can see, that
the customer can see.

384
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,135
Some in some organizations,
regulatory institutions,

385
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,840
you might be driven by
improving compliance,

386
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,100
but especially in for-profit

387
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,020
and other mission-driven organizations,

388
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,160
they are trying to improve
customer satisfaction,

389
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,430
build the brand.

390
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,580
And it's not just about making money.

391
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,399
Even in for-profit organizations

392
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
certainly increasing
profit, lowering costs

393
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,239
and increasing revenue to
drive that increased profit

394
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,680
are key elements of what the organization

395
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,350
is trying to do every day.

396
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,350
But we need to keep in
mind how our work in terms

397
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,330
of building out confidentiality,
integrity, and availability

398
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,659
that CIA triad leads to
increased efficiency,

399
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,580
business innovation, improved reliability,

400
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,929
and how those actions
and activities map up

401
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,920
to the higher level items that
the organization cares about

402
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,750
and ultimately helps
our organization achieve

403
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,323
its mission and vision.

404
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,480
So one way that has become common practice

405
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,230
to gauge your progress
for your security program

406
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,040
is to do some sort of maturity comparison.

407
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,270
Now on the left-hand side
here, we've broken this up

408
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,320
in this example into the
five different functions

409
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,899
of the NIST cybersecurity framework,

410
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,480
but we've also got a number
of elements in this chart here

411
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,190
that every single security
leader, every single executive,

412
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,270
every board member at
some point wants to know,

413
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,360
where are you today?

414
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,790
What's your current state?

415
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,820
Where do you want to get to in the future?

416
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,250
What's your target state?

417
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,010
And oh, by the way, how
do you compare with others

418
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,843
in the industry?

419
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,010
In this example, that is the yellow line

420
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,010
in the middle of this chart.

421
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,660
Now you can't just make up this chart,

422
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,850
like I made this one
up, a lot of research,

423
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,870
a lot of information gathering
goes into this in terms

424
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,244
of accurately conveying your organization

425
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:14,780
and your team's current state.

426
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,129
So this is another tool
that you wanna have

427
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,150
in your tool belt, in your
arsenal, in your slide deck

428
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,080
that you can show senior
leadership why your program

429
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,360
is where it is and what your plan

430
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,372
is for the program overall.

431
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,840
Now this brings us to
strategic communications.

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,980
You know your mission,
you know your vision,

433
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,070
you've laid out the corresponding plan.

434
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,780
Well, it turns out that
you need to communicate

435
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,360
about your plan over
and over and over again.

436
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,620
It turns out that if your
team doesn't know your plan

437
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,409
or doesn't understand it,
then you don't have one

438
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,440
because you can't implement it.

439
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,920
John Kotter in his book, "Leading Change,"

440
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,606
lays out a process for driving
large change initiatives

441
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:00,410
like your security program.

442
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,937
One of the things he says is that,

443
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:05,479
"Hey, you can't just communicate
about your strategic plan

444
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,530
in your monthly, all hands meetings,

445
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,660
in your quarterly all hands,

446
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,550
meetings in your weekly team meetings.

447
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,419
It might feel like a lot,
but if you add those up,

448
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,270
that might be maybe a hundreds
of different interactions

449
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,742
of mentioning elements
in your strategic plan."

450
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:24,300
He says this, he gives a suggestion.

451
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,240
What you should do instead is it go ahead

452
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
and identify the top
people in your organization

453
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,370
the managers, the directors, the leaders,

454
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,459
the team leads the technical experts

455
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,970
and ask them to do one simple thing.

456
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,380
Every single day just mention,

457
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,760
talk about your strategic program

458
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,500
your strategic plan five times.

459
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,210
And let's say that there are 10 people

460
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,810
who you've asked to do this
and it's not anything big.

461
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,647
It's something simple like,

462
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,439
"Hey, I'm thinking
about this new project."

463
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,710
And ask, have your people ask that?

464
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,620
Oh, how does that relate
to our strategic plan?

465
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,479
Oh, where can we find that
item in our strategic plan?

466
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,270
And by having these 10 people
ask five times every day,

467
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,310
those simple questions, well,
if you multiply that out

468
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,909
10 times five is 50, 50
times 365 days a year, right?

469
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,203
That is a lot more than the 100 times

470
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,170
you might normally talk about your plan

471
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,920
within the organization.

472
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,840
And this is one way that you can improve

473
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,102
your strategic communications.

474
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,580
Now, this brings us to this
concept of leading change.

475
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,490
BJ Fogg at Stanford
came up with this model,

476
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,820
the Fogg Behavior Model.

477
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,040
And he says, "If you
wanna change behaviors,

478
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,120
if you wanna get people to
do new things in any area,

479
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,330
Well, in our case, from
a security perspective

480
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,270
you've got to think
about, well motivation,

481
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,810
ability and prompts.

482
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,210
Now, it's not that the
people in our organizations,

483
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,390
it's not that they don't wanna be secure,

484
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,460
it's just they don't know
necessarily or have the ability

485
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,340
how to do it.

486
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,740
So let's take an example.

487
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,670
Maybe we tell people, "Hey,
don't send un-encrypted data

488
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,240
in email, make sure that you
send your email encrypted."

489
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,470
Well, people's motivation
to do that might be high

490
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,950
because well, they don't
wanna cause a data breach.

491
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,740
They don't wanna cause a data issue,

492
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,760
but their ability might be low.

493
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,129
If we don't give them the
appropriate tools to do that.

494
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,350
If we only have them
do send encrypted email

495
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,610
using a more complex
system, perhaps like PGP.

496
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,752
Well, because their
ability is low, even though

497
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:28,050
their motivation is high,
they fall well under

498
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,840
what BJ Fogg calls this action line.

499
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,230
So instead we've got to
increase their ability

500
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,190
by doing things like, providing
an easy send secure button

501
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,770
within the email client.

502
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,490
And that increases their ability,

503
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,110
coupled with their motivation,
it's going to move them

504
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,500
closer to that action
line, but people are busy.

505
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,930
People still might forget,

506
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,920
this is where the
prompts actually come in.

507
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,427
Just like you get a warning that says,

508
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,030
"do you really wanna send that email

509
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,970
without a corresponding subject line?

510
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,807
You can prompt them by
asking, hey, things like

511
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:04,650
"Do you wanna send this
email securely," instead?

512
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,790
So you wanna make it easy
for people by combining,

513
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,770
by thinking about both motivation ability

514
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,360
and of course your various prompts

515
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,940
All right, now, this brings
us to transforming yourself.

516
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,470
While developing your
team and your program

517
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,510
you need to work on also
transforming yourself

518
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,310
by understanding well,
you, your own motivations

519
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,550
and learning to apply these
lessons to your team members.

520
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,470
So what can you do in this area?

521
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,130
First, we've got coaching,
mentoring, and sponsorship.

522
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,870
How can you help others
and transform yourself

523
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,739
at the same time?

524
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,660
It turns out that both
asking for and providing help

525
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,990
in the form of coaching, mentoring

526
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,010
and sponsorship accomplishes both.

527
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,037
Now, it was Zig Ziglar that said,

528
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:57,798
"Hey, you can get
anything you want in life,

529
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:02,620
if you help enough other people
get what they want as well."

530
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,479
And this is why we're going
to talk a little bit here

531
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,230
about coaching, mentoring,
and sponsorship.

532
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,920
So first, from a coaching perspective here

533
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,700
we've got this simple model here,

534
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,090
another four quadrant
two by two grid here.

535
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,840
That's nicely shaped in
the form of a circle.

536
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,379
We've got well, when you
are coaching somebody,

537
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,040
and maybe when you're even
thinking about coaching yourself

538
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,550
you've got to ask these questions, right?

539
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,639
First, the hardest one to
ask is what is the goal?

540
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,020
What are you trying to accomplish?

541
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,800
How are you gonna know
when that's done, right?

542
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,970
When I have my first big executive job,

543
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,080
the organization that I was
at, we give all new executives

544
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,129
in that organization and executive coach.

545
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,270
Now a coach is somebody by definition,

546
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,490
kind of like a sports
coach that helps, right?

547
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,100
Is trying to help you, your
kids develop certain skills,

548
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,399
shoot the ball better,
swing the bat better,

549
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,740
whatever it might be, right?

550
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,770
Improve times in certain events.

551
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,610
And so you've got to
have some goals in place.

552
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,500
And this executive coach
helped me set some goals

553
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,400
about how am I gonna go
ahead and build relationships

554
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,350
within the organization?

555
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,340
Then you gotta ask, well,
what is your current state,

556
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,409
the current reality, what
options, what are some ways

557
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,550
that you can achieve that overall goal

558
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,399
based on your current state,
based on your current reality?

559
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,730
And then with the coach,
you as the coach should do

560
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,250
is to help them think through
what option works best,

561
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,810
what support they actually need.

562
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,060
But notice you, the
coach are not prescribing

563
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,950
are not defining what they should do.

564
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,210
You're helping, right?

565
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,630
The person that you're
coaching go through this model

566
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,603
so that they can come to
a decision on their own.

567
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,687
Now we also have mentoring here.

568
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:47,870
Mentoring is a little bit
different from coaching, right?

569
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,409
Coaching member to build a
specific skill mentoring here

570
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,790
on the other hand is a
lot of times actually

571
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,700
about a two-way
relationship over the years.

572
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,730
I've been lucky enough, fortunate
enough to have some people

573
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,790
ask if I could be their mentor.

574
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,920
And I don't always jump
to saying yes, right?

575
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,500
I always think, okay, well, can
I actually help this person?

576
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,180
And if I try to help this person,

577
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,100
do I think that they're gonna act?

578
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,800
Are they gonna actually take the advice

579
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,240
and turn it into action?

580
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
But then I also think to myself, oh, okay,

581
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,590
well not only can I help this person,

582
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,959
but hey, what can I learn?

583
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,990
Can I learn something from
this relationship as well?

584
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,300
So it's also about being
mentoring somebody,

585
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,110
but also right being mentored
yourself in some way.

586
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,540
And there's been some
relationships over the years

587
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,210
where that has started as a mentorship,

588
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,130
and now it's turned into more of a peer

589
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,930
and a friend relationship.

590
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,580
So it could be highly fulfilling.

591
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,050
Now, moving on to sponsorship
here, Marissa Mayer,

592
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,687
former CEO at Yahoo said,

593
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,159
"Hey, for someone who believes in you,

594
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,990
because when they believe in
you, they will invest in you."

595
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,350
And so this gets us to sponsorship

596
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,199
is this is different from coaching,

597
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
building a specific skill,

598
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,790
mentorship supporting another person

599
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,812
learning from each other.

600
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:02,840
A workplace sponsor is
somebody that is able to guide

601
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,530
and influence your career.

602
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,030
This means that typically they're
in a more senior position,

603
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,940
it could be your manager,

604
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,700
it could be your director could be your VP

605
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,020
and they because they've
seen you do amazing work,

606
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,430
take an interest in advancing your career

607
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,707
'cause you've got a lot of potential.

608
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:21,270
And honestly, they want to sponsor you

609
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,730
because they know that you're
going to do amazing work.

610
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,220
And by extension,

611
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,900
they know that you're going
to make them look good.

612
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,170
So a lot of times that if you
wanna advance even further

613
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,730
in your career, this is finding a sponsor.

614
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,090
Getting a sponsor is really necessary

615
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,740
to advance into a lot of
those executive and C-level

616
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,113
positions in terms of
jump-starting your career overall.

617
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Now, this brings us to
this concept of the P.I.E.

618
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,899
Performance, image and exposure.

619
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,350
Now there's a gentleman by
the name of Harvey J. Coleman.

620
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,530
He used to be an executive
at IBM and he was rising up

621
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,363
through the ranks.

622
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:59,440
At some point, he hit a ceiling though

623
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,100
and he found he couldn't
advance any further.

624
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,310
And in frustration, he left
IBM and went into consulting

625
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,050
and it wasn't until some
time later he realized,

626
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,590
one of the reasons that
I wasn't able to advance

627
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,389
is 'cause I didn't correctly
think about the P.I.E.

628
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,590
Now, when you are advancing your career

629
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,740
going from more senior positions
and perhaps helping others

630
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,088
on your team go for more senior positions.

631
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:24,010
Well, it's not just
about performance, right?

632
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,157
To advancing your career,
Harvey J. Coleman says,

633
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:30,179
"Performance is only 10% of your ability

634
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,670
to advance in your career."

635
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,720
Once you reach that point, right?

636
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,840
Now, when I first started
out as an engineer,

637
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,230
as a developer building
systems and applications

638
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,820
typing all day at my keyboard,
close to a 100% of my job

639
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,000
success was tied to my performance.

640
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,060
How well could I do that job?

641
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,230
But as you progress in your
career, being great at your job

642
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,540
that's just table stakes, right?

643
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,420
It's just, "Hey, you've got to perform

644
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,790
to even just get an
invitation to the party."

645
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,550
That's what we're talking about here.

646
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,617
Then Harvey J Coleman also says,

647
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:04,800
"30% of your ability to advance
in your career is image."

648
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,180
How do people perceive you?

649
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,180
But check this out, a
full 60% is making sure

650
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,980
that you have the right relationships

651
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,470
managing your exposure.

652
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,620
So the right people will
actually know you, right?

653
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,273
Related to what we were just talking about

654
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:22,961
from a sponsorship perspective.

655
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:27,440
Now this brings us to the
six C's of career management.

656
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,180
My friend and mentor Steve
Katz, who's widely regarded

657
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,030
as the world's first CISO.

658
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,510
He's told me about this
model, this little tool here

659
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,710
to think about, Hey, helping others

660
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,500
in their career, or even
managing your career as well

661
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,950
that he calls the six C's.

662
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,810
Number one, challenge.

663
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,610
Are you trying to take
this new opportunity

664
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,889
because it's something
you haven't done before?

665
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,200
And you challenge that
you wanna undertake?

666
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,640
Number two, chemistry.

667
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,900
Are you gonna be able to work
well with your leadership team

668
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,690
with your peers and with
your team members, right?

669
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,320
What does that actually look like in terms

670
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,909
of the team dynamic?

671
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,510
And do they have a commitment to you

672
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,280
or you really brought in just
to be the fall person, right?

673
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,240
For that particular event.

674
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
And so the first three
that are listed here

675
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,030
are really more of the
motivational factors,

676
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,139
challenge, chemistry, commitment.

677
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,870
And then you can see that
the bottom three compensation

678
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,179
contract, right?

679
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,530
And commute, right?

680
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,876
These are more of your hygiene factors.

681
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,690
And I will say that,
they don't have to stay

682
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,880
in this order, right?

683
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,580
When I first had kids, for example, right?

684
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,960
Commute was actually the top of my list

685
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,720
for a brief period of time,

686
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,790
because you know with new
kids, with young babies,

687
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,070
you wanna be home and you know
I didn't wanna be traveling

688
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,330
so much anymore.

689
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,210
So that rose to the top, but
as circumstances change, right?

690
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,830
You might reorder some of these.

691
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,379
So you wanna recognize when
this order changes for you,

692
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,100
and keep your finger on the
pulse of when this order

693
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,250
changes for your team members as well,

694
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,913
in terms of prioritization
and helping them

695
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:58,220
get what they want in their
jobs, in their careers

696
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,383
and in their lives.

697
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,250
So kind of in summary here,
leading transformation, right?

698
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,490
Leadership, isn't just about a title.

699
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,460
It's about getting people
ready to fill your shoes

700
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,850
building something sustainable
and finding happiness and joy

701
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,840
in these various activities, the tools,

702
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,828
the items that we've
talked about so far today.

703
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:24,270
Now, in terms of your
personal action plan.

704
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,690
Well, what can you do?

705
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,870
Well, within a week here
in this first column,

706
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,270
some suggestions when you go back to work,

707
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,450
take a little bit of time to try to start

708
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,020
to understand your team members' goals.

709
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,830
What are their motivations, right?

710
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,560
What do they actually want?

711
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,730
And then as you're
building out your program,

712
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,640
identify your key business partners,

713
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,100
think about building
relationships with them

714
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,209
but also for yourself,
make sure that you define

715
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,190
your corresponding career goals

716
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,819
within three months and make sure

717
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:00,500
you create an engaged
employee engagement plan

718
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,370
based on what you've learned
about your team members.

719
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,760
And you might all ready
know a lot of this,

720
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,070
but take some time to
explicitly write it down and say

721
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,899
and work with them to
create this engagement plan

722
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,800
of what they actually want.

723
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,430
Develop the vision, the
mission for your security team,

724
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,099
your security program overall.

725
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:21,379
And if you don't all ready,
try to find somebody to mentor

726
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,810
because remember this is a
two-way street of helping

727
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,750
somebody learning from somebody as well.

728
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,300
And then longer term within six months

729
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,210
and try to incorporate
that radical feedback

730
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,160
that we were talking about.

731
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,800
And I put this with a longer time horizon

732
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,715
'cause depending if you're
all ready doing some of this,

733
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:41,559
then great, but some
people might find this hard

734
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,730
to incorporate this radical feedback

735
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,490
and need to build up to it.

736
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,533
Also for your program overall,
create your strategic plan

737
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,517
and work towards finding
a sponsor for yourself,

738
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:55,370
depending where you
wanna go in your career,

739
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,860
depending on your career goals.

740
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:59,087
Well, that's going to determine, define,

741
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:03,610
well what type of sponsor
you might want to identify.

742
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,820
All right, so this brings us
to the end of the session.

743
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,210
We're gonna go ahead and be able to answer

744
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,270
some questions here as well.

745
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,920
If you have any questions,
wanna stay in touch

746
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,520
wanna share your journey
about where you are

747
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,270
in terms of some of these
different activities

748
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,480
that we've talked about.

749
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,264
Please feel free to reach
out to me at any time.

750
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,659
Now, just remember
whether you're a currency,

751
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,600
so someone looking for a more
senior leadership position

752
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,290
you can use the items that we talked

753
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,760
about in this CISO leadership action plan

754
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,010
to transform your team,
transform your program

755
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,390
and ultimately transform yourself.

756
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,610
Thank you all very much.
