1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,260
- Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,860
My name is Mark Weatherford

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,800
and I am the moderator
for this panel today,

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,469
New Options for Better
Supply Chain Cybersecurity.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,540
And I'm joined today by
three distinguished guests,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,200
Jennifer Bisceglie, CEO
and founder of Interos,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,919
Chris Blask, the Global Director

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
for Information Security at Unisys,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,663
and Tom Alrich from
Tom Alrich Consultants.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,240
I am gonna begin today by
just asking each of the panels

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,420
to take 60 seconds or so
to introduce themselves,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,420
tell a little bit about their company

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,640
and what they do there

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,650
and then we'll jump right
into some questions.

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,610
Let's start with you Jennifer.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,460
- Sure, thanks for having me Mark.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,710
Jennifer Bisceglie, CEO
and founder of Interos.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,190
We have Artificial Intelligence platform

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,900
that leverages big data

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,480
and work with organizations
to do math, monitor,

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,879
and model their global supply
chains across multiple tiers

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,330
and multiple risk
factors every single day.

23
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,850
We look at everything
from financial risks,

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,379
to operational risks, to cyber risks,

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,289
and we suddenly become an
enterprise discussion based on

26
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,310
the recent attacks of the last 14 months

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,180
if you will, everything from COVID,

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,920
to solar winds, to the trade wars

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,970
and then most recently to the Suez Canal.

30
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,810
So, really excited to be here

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,946
and looking forward to the discussion.

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:20,820
- Thanks Jennifer.

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,289
Chris.

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,780
- I'm Chris Blask, I focus on
applied innovation at Unisys.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,370
The Digital Bill of Materials was an idea

36
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,620
that developed inside
Unisys about two years ago.

37
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,190
So I've been shepherding that forward

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,009
with a open-source code
and a non-profit consortium

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,400
in the Linux Foundation.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,100
And I'm looking forward to
the conversation as well.

41
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,933
- Thanks Chris.

42
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,683
Tom.

43
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:50,710
- Tom Alrich, consultant to
the electric power industry

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,440
and vendors of the electric power industry

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,440
for NERC CIP compliance
as well as more generally

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,560
for supply chain cybersecurity, now.

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,033
And I've been especially
focusing a lot on SBOMs,

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,259
Software Bill of Material, recently

49
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,260
and have been very involved
with the SBOM effort run by

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,240
the National Technology and
Information Administration.

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,960
So, looking forward to
our discussion today.

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
- Thanks Tom.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,770
So for the audience, in
case you haven't guessed

54
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,883
we're gonna talk about three things today,

55
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,609
by the time you leave
you're gonna understand

56
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,870
the relationships between
supply chain risk management,

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,930
Digital Bill of Materials, and
Software Bill of Materials.

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,790
So each of these panelists have
their own area of expertise

59
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,959
and we're gonna dig into
all of these things.

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,010
So let's start with you Jennifer.

61
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,890
And we've talked about supply
chain risk management forever.

62
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,109
It's a well-defined discipline.

63
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,560
But supply chain risk management in 2021

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,280
is different aside supply
chain risk management

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,850
in the 1900s.

66
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,239
So can you tell us how it's evolved

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,260
from this manual time-consuming
backward-looking approaches

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,679
and just how do we get where we are today

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,790
with supply chain risk management?

70
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,660
- Yeah, well I think the simplest answer

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,590
is simply the evolution of technology.

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,900
If you take it all the
way back to the 1900s

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,900
which was a while ago, but it
was very manual to your point.

74
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,640
It was very human

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
and that's because that
was, who was in control.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,670
And now you have technology
that shaking hands

77
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,100
between suppliers and providers
and transporters, excuse me

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,630
raw material providers, all
the way to the final goods

79
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,940
and technology is really
revolutionized everything.

80
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,940
And I think that's really the answer.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,510
I think that because of
the concept of cyber risks

82
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,760
which I know we're gonna be talking about

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,670
as well as become a critical
issue for supply chains.

84
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,760
And if you look at the
situation that just happened

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,870
with solar winds and the
effect on the reputation

86
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,990
of businesses that were included,

87
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,280
this is kind of a worst case scenario

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,820
for the C level executives

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,019
which I think is the other big change mark

90
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
because of technology

91
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,050
and technology being so
pervasive throughout our lives.

92
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,430
You cannot separate that

93
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,380
from your day-to-day business dealings.

94
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,980
And for the first time in my career

95
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,550
and I've been in global supply chain

96
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,570
and supply chain risk industry
for well over 20 years

97
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,500
this is a C-suite board level conversation

98
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,860
in a way that never has been before.

99
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,110
And I think the last 14 months,

100
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,800
if you could kind of
rewind it just that far.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,380
As you mentioned you had COVID

102
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,820
that one showed us not only did

103
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,700
we not know who we were
reliant on and connected

104
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,170
to in our supply chain, but whether

105
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,850
that was a good or a bad thing
and the concentration risk

106
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,979
whether it be the PPE
concerns or it'd be the

107
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,460
the consumer electronics
coming out of China

108
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,489
or the drugs coming out of India,

109
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,260
we just found out that we
were reliant on companies

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,430
and countries around the world

111
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,270
that we had no idea what that looked like.

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,870
And then you have the
ongoing trade wars with China

113
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,420
that are going away anytime real soon.

114
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,250
And then you had solar winds
where you had a good friend

115
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,920
mentor and investor and
interest the CEO of FireEye,

116
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,910
Kevin Mandia that literally
went on face the nation

117
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,510
and said solar winds was an attack

118
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,400
of the American supply chain.

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,250
And so I think to your
question it's really the advent

120
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,500
and just the pace of technology

121
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,150
and technology being so
pervasive through our lives

122
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,820
both personally and professionally

123
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,497
that has totally changed the conversation

124
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:37,647
and the cultural shift
around supply chain.

125
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,590
- Beautiful.

126
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,412
I could not agree more, right?

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,490
Even as you said, rewind it just 14 months

128
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,970
the conversations we have
about supply chain today

129
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,543
are so different than
they were just a year ago.

130
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,264
So Tom, everybody SBOM is like

131
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:59,683
the term does your legislators
are talking about SBOM now.

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,960
I fancy that very few of them

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,080
really understand what SBOM is.

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,010
Why don't you enlighten us?

135
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,550
Tell us a little bit
about what the software

136
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,053
bill of materials initiative is all about.

137
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,120
- Yeah, thanks Mark.

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,250
Modern software
development depends heavily

139
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,100
on use of pre-written components.

140
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,040
I mean, everyone uses
them and they use them

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,380
because they save the developer
just a huge amount of time

142
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,900
versus creating all the code from scratch.

143
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,669
And SBOM is at heart a
list of all the components

144
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,913
in a software product.

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,290
So one study last year concluded

146
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,070
that the average software product contains

147
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,230
over a hundred components and that,

148
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,230
and some of the products
include thousands of components

149
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,570
because each of these components

150
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,690
can have its own vulnerabilities.

151
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,850
These need to be tracked

152
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,790
and remediated just like
vulnerabilities in the code

153
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,120
the developer themselves wrote.

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,640
But you can't do that unless you know

155
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,539
what the components are.

156
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,130
And so an SBOM tells you
what the components are.

157
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,130
But even then in most cases

158
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,610
a simple list of the
components just isn't enough.

159
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,110
If your organization uses
multiple software products

160
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,400
and they each include
over a hundred components,

161
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,789
you'll quickly realize that you need

162
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,290
to track these components
using automated processes.

163
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,530
This means you need to receive your SBOM

164
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,520
in a machine-readable format.

165
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,150
And then this can be an input

166
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,310
into your existing processes
for vulnerability management,

167
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,333
configuration management, et cetera.

168
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,640
There are three primary
SBOM formatting used today.

169
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,640
SPDX, cyclone DX and SWID
S-W-I-D, they're all available

170
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,743
both in machine readable
and human readable formats.

171
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:53,159
- Well, it doesn't take
very long to realize

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
make your head explode

173
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,410
when you think about the permutations

174
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,810
of all these hundreds of
different modules and sub routines

175
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,090
and sub components in a piece of software

176
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,679
and of all the software we
have within our organization.

177
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,420
So, we'll get more,

178
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,160
I have some really hard questions
for you here in a minute.

179
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,690
So Chris, why don't you kind
of put a bow around this thing

180
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,230
and talk about the digital
bill of materials and really

181
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,890
I think summarize what is the difference

182
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,750
between an SBOM and a DBOM?

183
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,260
- Sure, I think the explanation fits well

184
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,750
with what Jennifer and Tom
does said, because again

185
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,683
we have a lot of converging
threats and the DBOM evolved.

186
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,159
You're in fact, back into
2018 and a crowd like us,

187
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,130
critical infrastructure
folks talking about this

188
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,870
that there's no supply chain visibility.

189
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,320
You can't say what's inside anything.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
And early 2019 with Mattie in Disarray

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
who can't be here today?

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,520
The conversation of can't
we just write this down.

193
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,160
Can we create a digital bill of materials?

194
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,430
We're a big company, we buy
from and sell to big companies.

195
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,380
And we were the folks
inside these companies

196
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,580
that know how this works

197
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,180
and the answer is yes.

198
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,459
So, that digital bill of materials

199
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,290
is a stack of attestations,

200
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,000
is a stack of information about a thing.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,137
And as Thomas said,
software bill of materials,

202
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:09,969
you had to have that

203
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,340
What's the contents of
this piece of software.

204
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,410
Another interesting thread
evolving at the same time

205
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,520
is software custody,
out of the major banks

206
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,870
and major solution providers in the world

207
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,740
have been working with a project called

208
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,470
In Toto that creates
that attestations about

209
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,360
who touched the software
and develop through

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,870
your CICD pipeline can be attested to.

211
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,250
So, as we looked at it

212
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,970
we had to create an
attestation infrastructure

213
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,210
and the which leads us
to the DBOM consortium,

214
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,140
the Lions Foundation
Project launching this year,

215
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,550
the DBOM node code on opensource on GitHub

216
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,310
that we open-sourced

217
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,410
because no company is
big enough to do this.

218
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,010
We have to have a standardized way

219
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,290
to replace all the faxes and emails

220
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,520
and spreadsheets and share points

221
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,780
where all of this information
is being scattered

222
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,290
and have a repeatable
ecosystem where organizations

223
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,790
can just choose to share attestations

224
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,469
with each other software
bill of materials.

225
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,260
If you want that to go to someone

226
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,150
or you don't want to go to someone

227
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,449
it needs to be in a place in a format

228
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,140
that allows us to achieve our roles.

229
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,949
We don't have six days
in six weeks to respond.

230
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,700
These are not internet times.

231
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,720
So, that's the constant of a DBOM

232
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,010
but the infrastructure of the
DBOM that you'll hear about

233
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,220
is really just an
attestation infrastructure

234
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,123
for sharing information about
supply chain activities.

235
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,860
- So, can you maybe distinguish
a little bit further

236
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,303
the difference between
that DBOM and SBBOM.

237
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,670
- Sure, so SBOM is an attestation.

238
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,060
In some company, maybe
the vendor of the software

239
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,280
who is saying here's what we put inside.

240
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,640
It could be a third party

241
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
who's looked at software decompiler

242
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,900
in partnership with a
vendor or separately.

243
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,189
Who's was making an attestation

244
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,090
about the contents of an artifact.

245
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,690
In this case, B is the software.

246
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,100
The digital bill of
materials, architecture

247
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,870
is the places, is a way
to create the repositories

248
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,223
the channels that these
attestations could be shared

249
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:21,620
in the way intended by
the parties involved.

250
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,750
So a software vendor like
Unisys can create a channel

251
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,940
where we share information

252
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,720
about our iOS 2,400 operating
system that underlies

253
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,860
our major financial customer systems

254
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,000
that they can see and they can act on.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,660
It's not on our website.

256
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,670
It's not something you
emailed or got in your Dropbox

257
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,680
but it's an official channel
where everybody can see

258
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,380
where things have been put

259
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,240
and where the access to that information

260
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,750
can be managed by the nodes,

261
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,503
by the gateways to the
attestation ecosystem.

262
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,130
- Okay, thanks.

263
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,047
It's still a little bit
confusing but I know

264
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,115
we're gonna get a little bit
clearer as we go through.

265
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:02,170
So, Jennifer, let's go
back to you on this.

266
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,329
You mentioned solar winds a second ago.

267
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,110
I think, it's certainly
one of the catalysts

268
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,180
for a lot of the activity
we see around supply chain.

269
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,120
So, why have these kinds

270
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,810
of supply chain cybersecurity
challenges become more

271
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,670
of a critical issue for
C-suites like you mentioned

272
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,300
and not just for the CIO.

273
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,717
So, we have long lived in
this world where the CEO said

274
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,540
"my security guy handles that."

275
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,006
That's no longer the case.

276
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,589
Talk to us a little bit about that.

277
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,790
- Well, I think because
Apple missed its earnings

278
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,160
when COVID hit, right?

279
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,469
That's not a CISO problem.

280
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,880
That's a CEO and a board level problem

281
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,620
because a shift just got stuck

282
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,720
that stopped freight and
it can drive full prices up

283
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,790
and it stopped textiles and spare parts

284
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,170
from getting where they needed to get to.

285
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,490
That's a CEO problem.

286
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,540
That's not a CISO problem.

287
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,839
And I think what we've
rapidly seen, and again,

288
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,260
it's been coming to your point.

289
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,930
A lot of people have been talking about it

290
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,410
but I think when you
have a crisis, like COVID

291
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,500
that I think everybody on this panel

292
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,620
and watching no one would have predicted

293
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,690
it would be this long that we
were all still stuck at home

294
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,690
doing work from home activities.

295
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,430
And it's making people
miss their earnings,

296
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,609
it's keeping, and it also
became very personal, Mark.

297
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,520
So for the first time, supply
chain is very, very personal.

298
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,760
When I can't get toilet paper

299
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,180
and paper towels, that's a problem.

300
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,930
And that's the first time, again,

301
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,370
I keep going back to my career

302
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,790
but it's the first time in my career that

303
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,510
my mother actually knows what I do

304
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,920
because it actually impacted
her in her own home, right?

305
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,860
And that's a real thing.

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,628
And then when the ship
got stuck, again, this is

307
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,700
there was a lot of textiles on there.

308
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,040
So, now this is clothing
and things like that.

309
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,569
Now you can't dress your
kids and your grandkids.

310
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,050
And so, when things like that happened

311
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,750
so much of this, whether it be solar winds

312
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,880
which is everybody
thinks cyber is a thing.

313
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,020
And cyber to me is just an access point,

314
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,140
is an access and an opportunity point

315
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,863
for business to business
to have harm potentially.

316
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,650
But you have a situation where

317
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,810
now it's actually affecting
my brand and my reputation

318
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,170
and that's 100% why it becomes
a C-suite and a CEO problem.

319
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,839
The other thing that's
interesting about it

320
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,590
is the definition of supply chain

321
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,660
has been changed very very quickly,

322
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,949
whereas your point, it very much erode

323
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,940
the coattails of cyber for many years

324
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,210
because what cyber taught
is a couple of things.

325
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,160
It taught us it's not the
company I know I'm connected to

326
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,020
it's the companies they're connected to

327
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,150
that caused the problem.

328
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,220
So it's the unknown connection
and the unknown risk.

329
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,800
It also very much
brought to the forefront.

330
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,319
You can't do this once a year.

331
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,710
It's gotta be done in a fashion
of continuous monitoring.

332
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,950
And so to the CISOs have always been

333
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,000
the ones to adopt this first

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,190
but I'll be honest with
you over the last year

335
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,650
of the conversation goes
from the CISOs saying,

336
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,800
yes, this is my problem to bring in

337
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520
to saying this is really
not my problem to solve,

338
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,810
but I can move fast.

339
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,290
So we're gonna get you in here.

340
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,060
And then we're gonna move
you over to procurement

341
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,939
or the general counsel or
the chief risk officer.

342
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,950
And it's because the CEO is
now being held accountable.

343
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,790
I think, you know the
zinger we're thinking about

344
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,900
is when COVID hit, nothing
when we look at normally

345
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,819
how we do supply chain
onboarding of vendors,

346
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,530
we asked the vendors for the
last three years of financials,

347
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,079
we ask what the bigger customers.

348
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,610
Customers are for references and capacity

349
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,160
and nothing in the last
three years of financials

350
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,250
could ever have predicted
how your suppliers

351
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,450
would have acted based on COVID

352
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,280
and the breakdown that occurred.

353
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
And so I think this became very personal.

354
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,410
It became very tactical.

355
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,860
This is risk management 101

356
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,250
and it literally became a
brand and reputational concern

357
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,083
which immediately put it on the CEO

358
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,872
and the board level's desk.

359
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,242
- Thanks, so Chris,

360
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,330
leveraging off of that,
let's talk about data.

361
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,173
How does all the supply chain data,

362
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,450
it's everywhere and we have lots of it

363
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,450
but how does this get shared
today in an efficient fashion?

364
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,440
And how can this kind of
information be made available

365
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,076
to the millions of stake holders

366
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:23,076
that need to see it, but
without giving away your IP.

367
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,970
- Exactly, and the keyword
there was efficient

368
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,710
because to be clear, these
systems are very efficient now.

369
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,910
We have advanced procurement
systems that work

370
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,490
with our partners and we working

371
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,340
through this with the DBOM consortium.

372
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,530
What I like are cases that aren't just

373
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,110
about software bill of materials

374
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,760
where someone's using a machine tool

375
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,920
that has software in it.

376
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,599
So there's a software bill
of materials about that,

377
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,090
but there's also steel.

378
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,640
And there's information from
the Foundry and so forth.

379
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,550
And you'll find as you've
walked through these scenarios

380
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,430
with all the stakeholders

381
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,189
that people actually
doing these things today,

382
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,190
and not just making
the cybers or security,

383
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,250
but Jennifer is point
delivering the things

384
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,920
that we use every day.

385
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,750
You find out that the
methods they're using

386
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,920
include literally the fax machine

387
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,980
is one of the big use cases
for fax to loosen supply chain

388
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,930
for those emails and spreadsheets.

389
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,599
And it's the application
of all these together

390
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,984
that's driving this change.

391
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:26,389
Yes, solar winds and security.

392
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,270
I can hack that plasma table
and make it make bad brackets

393
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,000
for cameras over highways,

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
but that's probably not
gonna be the problem.

395
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,110
The problem may be shipping the Suez canal

396
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,159
and maybe occlusions in the metal coming

397
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,830
from the Foundry, right?

398
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,409
So it's getting all these attestations

399
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,500
that already exist.

400
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,330
That already exists between to your point

401
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,020
about the IP control,

402
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,050
the partners who are
already doing these things.

403
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,840
The Foundry and the fabrication shop

404
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,209
already have a relationship.

405
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,890
They have contracts, they're
sharing this information now.

406
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,260
We find that as we
automated and digitized it

407
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,450
we can have savings on
the IP protection space

408
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,290
where all you share in
an automated fashion

409
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,659
as an asses station, but a single thing

410
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,590
instead of having investigators
coming in and asking

411
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,790
for all your records, right?

412
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,320
So I think we find that
we have better IP control

413
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,929
better enunciating the
existing relationships

414
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,770
and automating business
relationships that already exist.

415
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,660
That just happened to involve Cybers

416
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,670
- Cool, thank you.

417
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,850
Okay, Tom, so I'm back to SBOMs

418
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,892
cause I love SBOM, but
I like to saying SBOMs.

419
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,810
So, the the idea for SBOMs is not new.

420
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,490
And in fact they've been
around for a number of years.

421
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,950
But we really are kind
of coalescing right now.

422
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,730
And with, through some of the other,

423
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,320
some of the things that
you've been working on,

424
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,919
some of the things that
NTIA is working on,

425
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,250
why do you think that
there's been a delay?

426
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,653
Why haven't SBOM been widely adopted yet?

427
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
- Yeah, thanks Mark.

428
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:05,550
SBOMs are caught in a classic
chicken and egg situation.

429
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,909
Most large software developers
are already producing SBOMs

430
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,670
for their internal use.

431
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,920
Since they're almost always a by-product

432
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,590
of modern development tools

433
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,439
they just produce them automatically.

434
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,380
They aren't distributing them however

435
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,850
because their customers
aren't asking for them,

436
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,149
meanwhile, their customers
aren't experienced

437
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,480
or knowledgeable with
using SBOMs to reduce risk.

438
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,030
So they aren't asking for them.

439
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,480
So this is why the National Technology

440
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,220
and Information Administration
or NTIA of the U S department

441
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,500
of commerce, three years ago
started a proof of concept

442
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,860
for use of SBOMs in
the healthcare industry

443
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,740
and in the POC, which is ongoing today,

444
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,070
although they're in later iterations,

445
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,570
but they're still working on this.

446
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,020
A small number of hospitals
and medical device makers,

447
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,863
worked out procedures for
producing and using SBOMs.

448
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,120
They started with a simple use case

449
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,429
and have expanded to include
more elaborate use cases.

450
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,070
And now other industries
are starting their own POCs

451
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,700
including autos and electric power.

452
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,743
And I'm involved with the power POC.

453
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,200
There will likely be POC

454
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,000
for other industries like banking
starting in the next year.

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,190
These proofs of concept

456
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,360
have already uncovered important issues

457
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,870
that need to be addressed.

458
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,872
So that SBOMs can be widely used.

459
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,600
They all have to do much
more with procedures

460
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,790
than with technical issues.

461
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,200
In fact, the purely technical issues

462
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,390
with SBOMs are almost
all completely solved.

463
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,560
The important point is that

464
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,540
the procedural solutions developed

465
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,129
in these proofs of concepts
apply to all industries,

466
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,053
not just the one conducting the POC.

467
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,510
Now, as more organizations
start using SBOMs

468
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,050
for risk management,

469
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,129
and there are certainly
other use cases as well,

470
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,500
they'll start requiring them

471
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,980
of all their softwares,
all their suppliers

472
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,260
and some companies of course
already are requiring them

473
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,050
at a certain point and definitely
within three years or so

474
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,330
we'll reach the stage where
suppliers will compete

475
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,659
with each other to provide
SBOMs as efficiently

476
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,603
as possible since the
users are asking for them.

477
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,070
And Gardner says that by 2024 SBOMs

478
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,439
that are regularly updated
because that's important,

479
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
will be a non-negotiable
procurement requirement

480
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,930
for over half of
enterprise software buyers.

481
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,630
And my guess is that's about right

482
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,200
that I will also point out
that the NTIA volunteers

483
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,130
also develop documents discussing aspects

484
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,000
of SBOM development,
distribution, and use.

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,177
And you can find those on the NTIA website

486
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,800
for the software transparency initiative

487
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,800
and it's available at ntia.doc
department of commerce

488
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:09,883
.gov/software transparency.

489
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:12,920
And I also have, I'm sorry

490
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,650
I have additional
information in my blog posts,

491
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,650
you can drop me an email

492
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,433
or a search in my blog under SBOM.

493
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,389
- Now let's come back to that

494
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,840
because, Tom knows, I've
been a religious reader

495
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,620
of his blog for a number of years

496
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,750
that you actually hit on something.

497
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,800
I think there that's,

498
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,830
well, it's long been one of my hotspots

499
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,070
when I was at NERC,

500
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,750
and I would meet with
control system vendors

501
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,693
and talk to them about security,

502
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,490
building security into the products

503
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,930
kind of the almost universal
refrain I got back was

504
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,960
but our customers aren't asking for it.

505
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,750
And, it's just good to see that the world

506
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,730
has shifted a little bit.

507
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,040
We're now, the vendors are actually going

508
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,379
to be providing this.

509
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,880
And I do think in a year or two,

510
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,780
we're gonna see those
kind of a wholesale shift

511
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,129
in the kind of mentality.

512
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,470
So Jennifer, moving on here.

513
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,840
So, Terrell's technology
is based on the ability

514
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,870
of use artificial
intelligence and AI and ML

515
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,449
to discover data that we haven't been able

516
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,480
to look at before that
we haven't been able

517
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,630
to discover before.

518
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,110
So, talk about how AI addresses
supply chain vulnerabilities

519
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,260
when it comes to cyber
risk and the supply chain,

520
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,590
and determining the cyber hygiene,

521
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,189
not just of the prime suppliers,

522
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,480
but as you say, the N
plus one or N minus one,

523
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,480
N minus two, N minus N
suppliers in the supply chain.

524
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:46,370
- Happy to enhance your talking

525
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,632
and like Chris and Tom were talking about

526
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,566
this is all about,

527
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:51,650
we look at kind of the bill of materials.

528
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,350
So the sub components that
make up the finished goods

529
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,699
as well as all of the other relationships.

530
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,030
And so the way that we use
artificial intelligence

531
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,740
and the real power is, like
I said a few minutes ago,

532
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,830
it's really not the texting
the suppliers you know about.

533
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,899
And even maybe even the
risk in the suppliers

534
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
you know about.

535
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,730
It's alerting you to the latent risk

536
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,090
in the connections that you have

537
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,730
that you're unaware of
and what's happening

538
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,660
in those sub tiers.

539
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,000
So, most of us know the suppliers

540
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,870
that we're directly
handing a check to, right,

541
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,820
or tier ones or a third parties.

542
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,040
And we may even have relationships

543
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,450
with them where they actually
have some societal agreement

544
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,540
and self attestation
where they're updating us

545
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
with different types of information.

546
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,920
But you don't really know beyond that.

547
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,940
And actually we did a
study not too long ago

548
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,360
about 500 professionals
that we just asked,

549
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,899
what are you doing around the sub tiers?

550
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,493
And 2% looked below the tier one, 2%.

551
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:48,490
(laughing)

552
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,810
And that's, I mean, it
wasn't even an AI question.

553
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,557
It was just even ask a
question and it was like, wow.

554
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:56,504
And then you have the last 14 months.

555
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,649
So it's really about understanding

556
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,670
who you're connected to

557
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,930
and the nature of those
connections, right?

558
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,890
'Cause not all connections are
the same level of priority.

559
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,960
And do you need the same
hardening and mitigations.

560
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,370
Without that you really
have an incomplete picture

561
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,110
of your risk exposure as an organization.

562
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,850
The interesting thing about AI

563
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,899
and why we went this route
is that it has no lag, right?

564
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,810
Gone are the days of
surveys, gone are the days

565
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,270
of checking in once a year,
it's got no lag to it.

566
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,620
So the idea is I wouldn't
be able to not just know

567
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,120
about things real time,

568
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,239
but I wouldn't be able
to preempt disruption.

569
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,990
If I can understand something's happening

570
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,470
in my tier four tier five supplier,

571
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,550
can I get ahead of it and put mitigations

572
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,419
or go to alternatives before
I ever get preempted, right?

573
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,610
Which goes back to your question of

574
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,320
why is this a CEO conversation?

575
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,399
It handles large datasets.

576
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,410
And when I use it large datasets

577
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,440
now I'm aggregating a lot of information.

578
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,210
We bring outside information,

579
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,400
publicly available information in,

580
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,840
and actually make sense
of it in a structured way

581
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,189
so that you can actually see

582
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,622
the extended supply
chain and the monitoring.

583
00:26:01,622 --> 00:26:04,240
So you get efficiencies,

584
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,900
you get the ability to
optimize but more than that

585
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,810
if you think about
artificial intelligence,

586
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,580
the ability to actually see
the extended supply chain

587
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,040
if I'm a cyber professional,

588
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,110
it's really much easier for me to use.

589
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,080
Because if I pass CNN

590
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,970
or whatever TV show channel you watch.

591
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,200
Do we still have channels?

592
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,910
And that a breach was announced.

593
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,960
You can quickly check that
against your extended ecosystem

594
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,470
and say, okay, my tier 12 had a problem,

595
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,040
and then follow the mapping back to you

596
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,090
to figure out where you need

597
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,250
to partner and put mitigation in place.

598
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,520
And to me, the non lagging,

599
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,879
the ability to really get
a large amount of data.

600
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,230
So I can get way ahead

601
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,910
of any sort of disruption and preempt it.

602
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,790
That's really the power
that cyber professionals

603
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,060
and overall supply chain risk
professionals can harness

604
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,629
by leveraging artificial intelligence.

605
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,810
I'm a little excited about it

606
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,168
Mark, sorry.

607
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,143
- I can tell.

608
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,773
No, well, it is exciting.

609
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:01,540
I mean, like you said,
I think you could go

610
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,090
to any as a former CISO.

611
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,300
You could ask me who my
first tier suppliers were

612
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,490
and I could tell you who they all were

613
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,800
but where did they get
their supplies from?

614
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,360
I had no idea.

615
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,767
So I think that's the value

616
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,310
of what you guys are doing.

617
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,250
- No, I couldn't agree more
and I don't want to take away

618
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,540
from the other guys, but I mean

619
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,180
it's and everybody cares about it.

620
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,470
This morning I was on an interview

621
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,050
with the wall street journal about cotton

622
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,120
because of the problems that Nike and H&M

623
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,959
are having with child labor in China.

624
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,150
Now that's part of it.

625
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,560
So the conversation's brought in

626
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,040
from just security and cyber to cotton.

627
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,723
So, believe that if you will.

628
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,179
- So, Chris, let's go back

629
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,230
and talk about data again a little bit.

630
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,470
Can you describe the difference between

631
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,410
how we handle the sharing
of supply chain data today

632
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,180
and then kind of going back
to the efficiency thing?

633
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,320
How can we do it better?

634
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,210
How can we do it more effectively?

635
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,560
- Sure, the way we do it today

636
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,129
has worked so far, right?

637
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,920
And the reason this is
all changing right now is

638
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,630
because the direction we're going is more.

639
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,492
More data, industrial IOT,
the interconnectedness

640
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:14,122
of everything, but we've been doing it

641
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,330
with literally things like
fax machines and emails

642
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,050
a lot of implicit attestations.

643
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,520
You look at the contract language

644
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,200
for procurement of software, particularly,

645
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,810
and it's not as a particular
and specific as it should be.

646
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,530
So, you end up with organizations
attesting to each other

647
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,730
like this, because I've
done work for a long time.

648
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,120
I trust them, you say something to me

649
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,300
and we have a business relationship.

650
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,930
It's probably true

651
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,610
Now that doesn't actually scale
and automate going forward.

652
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,669
Obviously with keep adding
zeros to the number of devices

653
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,590
we have in lines of code.

654
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,669
So the way to automate that is

655
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,830
what you're seeing right here.

656
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,500
when you put these pieces together

657
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,270
and Tom has been deeply involved

658
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,610
with the software bill of
material ever longer than I have.

659
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,719
And there was people like Kate
Stewart and the SPDX program

660
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,690
at Lennox foundation that have 10 years,

661
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,760
11 years of developing that taxonomy.

662
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,770
And you have businesses like Jennifer's,

663
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,930
who've been brought into this, not because

664
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,810
it's a neat new area of
cybersecurity supply chain,

665
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,899
but because business is
going in this direction

666
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,020
and you need this.

667
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,770
You have this sort of
situational awareness

668
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,300
and all of your other business processes

669
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,950
we just hadn't got
around to codifying this.

670
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,020
So you see organizations
like in Terrell's,

671
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,129
bringing that business process to it.

672
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:30,120
Where Unisys and the DBOM
consortium community came in

673
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,899
was we need a common infrastructure

674
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,710
so that all this information can be found

675
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,690
in ways that matched the need

676
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,330
because as we find time and time again,

677
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,720
after this starts next or the
solar winds are waiting on.

678
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,260
That if you look around

679
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,120
you can find all the
attestations are there.

680
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,830
They may not be written down the same way.

681
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,360
So we need common taxonomies, like SBOMs

682
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,750
they may not be organized
in business process ways.

683
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,740
So we need integrations
with business process,

684
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,080
like in Terrell's

685
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,780
and they've been shared
in 1200 different ways.

686
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,610
So we need a common
attestation infrastructure,

687
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,683
like the DBOM node code.

688
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,080
- Yup.

689
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,649
Great, thank you.

690
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,511
Okay, Tom, so and this kind
of goes to the paranoia

691
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:19,129
of security people I think

692
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,270
but people are concerned
that by publishing

693
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,560
and providing transparency around the SBOM

694
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,500
that it will just provide the adversaries

695
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,700
with a roadmap for attacking our software.

696
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,050
How do you respond to that?

697
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,810
- Yeah, well, there's an objection

698
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,810
has been around for awhile

699
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,649
and probably will be for while
as more and more suppliers

700
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,060
are pressured to produce SBOMs.

701
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,060
And, but this concern
really doesn't hold water.

702
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,780
And for two reasons, the first
and the more important one

703
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,990
is that it's not too hard for
a somewhat knowledgeable user

704
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,880
to produce their own SBOM today.

705
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,680
I mean, they do it all the time.

706
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,710
People do it all the time.

707
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,330
The attackers are quite
skilled at doing this already.

708
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,780
So they've already got SBOMs.

709
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,960
They don't really need the
supplier to send them on

710
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,480
because they have it already.

711
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,520
So what's needed is for software users

712
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,700
to have the SBOMs as well

713
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,653
so that they can plan their defense.

714
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,080
The second reason is that
mass indiscriminate attacks

715
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,199
like Wanna Cry show that the
attacker doesn't need an SBOM.

716
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,030
They can distribute,
they can attack all these

717
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,080
all they want without having to worry

718
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,110
about what components are
in there or anything else.

719
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,902
So it just really doesn't make
much sense to bring this up.

720
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,960
Intuitively, it sounds
like it could be a problem

721
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,460
but really it isn't a problem.

722
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,429
- Well, we are a paranoid group of people.

723
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:51,120
So we I can't believe we're like

724
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,969
we have just a few minutes left here.

725
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,240
I have three more questions
but you have to promise me

726
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,290
you only answer them in 60 seconds.

727
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,360
Well, maybe 90 seconds.

728
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,179
So Jennifer, you can talk a little bit

729
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,340
about the need for public
private partnerships

730
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,909
when it comes to
government agencies moving

731
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,040
to protect their assets

732
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,013
from these supply chain
focused cyber attacks.

733
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,800
- Yeah, well, I think the
big meeting here, right,

734
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,230
is there the spoiler if you
see a border that's out there.

735
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,960
I think you have the executive
order for supply chain

736
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,520
that's coming out with recommendations

737
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,900
and then you have the executive
order for cyber security.

738
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,840
That there's so much news

739
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,310
about it already and it's not even out.

740
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,490
And so I think that there's a
very forward-leaning posture

741
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,150
that the government needs to lead with.

742
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,790
Some of these things been asking

743
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,990
to be very honest with you
agencies have been asking

744
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,470
for our kind of an overarching approach

745
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,980
from the government for a while.

746
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,730
And so I think you're
seeing the tipping point

747
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,810
under this administration
and we're all anxious to see

748
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,290
what those recommendations are

749
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,770
but given the activity
that's in the government,

750
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,250
if it doesn't include mapping monitoring

751
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,910
and continuously monitoring
your extended supply chain

752
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,180
I'm gonna be floored.

753
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,750
And then I also think that there's

754
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,700
a really big push right now.

755
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,260
And you saw it in the COVID relief bill,

756
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,879
where there was a $10 billion program

757
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,460
for assistant GSA to
stand up and collect once

758
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,290
and share whole of government approach.

759
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,370
You see the DOD trying
to do the same thing.

760
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,129
So I think you're gonna see a big movement

761
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,960
across the next couple fiscal years

762
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,040
for a whole of government
collect once and share

763
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,970
because there's a lot of redundancy.

764
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,760
A lot of the agencies are using all

765
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,820
the same suppliers to
do what they're doing

766
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,760
and I think that's a
benefit to the taxpayer.

767
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,370
So I think you have the executive orders

768
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,909
and then you have an undercurrent

769
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,720
of the ship's already left

770
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,970
with a whole of government approach.

771
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,570
And I think those two
things will come together

772
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,960
over the next 18 to 24 months.

773
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,910
- Okay, great.

774
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,900
So Chris, leveraging up
what Jennifer talked about

775
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,870
with the executive order.

776
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,459
What are your thoughts about this?

777
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,610
How, the two things that everyone

778
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,760
is talking about right now

779
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,010
is that the EO may
require software vendors

780
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,000
to notify the federal government customers

781
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,760
when they have a breach, which
is probably long overdue.

782
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,690
But the second is that it may
require them to have an ESBOM.

783
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,990
What are your thoughts
on the executive order?

784
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,280
- Well, again, if you watch
these things over time

785
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,900
you see inevitability and this
is coming sooner or later.

786
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,661
And given all the events
of the last 14 months

787
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,889
not even a year and a half,
if you didn't see this coming

788
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,940
and even the previous administration

789
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,030
had two executive orders
that went down the same path.

790
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,090
This not something really, really new

791
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,540
and so when we find we
have to solve something,

792
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,040
we find that we can.

793
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,259
And I think you can put together a piece

794
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,430
of this conversation with Tom overtime

795
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,469
with a standard software bill of materials

796
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:44,759
the IP control issues are containable.

797
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,840
What we find is that

798
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,179
the IP has already spread
all over the place.

799
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,350
So we'll get better
security by actually looking

800
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,989
at it and writing it
down in common formats

801
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,790
and sharing it and common ways
for actual business purposes.

802
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,020
- Thanks, yup.

803
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,363
Okay, Tom, let's wrap
with you last question.

804
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,350
And this is important for the audience.

805
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,730
How can people get involved

806
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,163
with the NTIA software
transparency initiative?

807
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,232
- Yeah, that's a very good point.

808
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,070
The first thing I recommend
they do is send an email

809
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,422
to Dr. Allen Friedman of the
Software Transparency News

810
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,090
- He's gonna hate you.

811
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,170
- Believe me, he loves getting emails.

812
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,370
So and he responds to
it, believe it or not.

813
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,420
His email is is on that
website that I said earlier

814
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,507
but it's also afriedman@ntia.doc.gov..

815
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,270
The other thing is to just go

816
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:49,270
to that page
ntia.doc.gov/softwaretransparency

817
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,140
And just look at the
stuff that's on there.

818
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,850
You'll see signups for
these four work groups

819
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,748
that meet once a week

820
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:04,130
and they have active email
conversations in between.

821
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,920
They're doing different things
and you may want to sign up

822
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,360
for one of them or all four
of them, or it doesn't matter.

823
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,330
It's no commitment.

824
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,540
You can just do what you want

825
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,803
but the point is you can
get involved that way.

826
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,710
There are also other videos

827
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,340
and presentations on that
webpage you can look at.

828
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,450
And then, plus there's a separate page

829
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,100
with documents that have
already been produced

830
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,500
by the initiative and finalize.

831
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,500
And so they are finalized until
the next revision comes up.

832
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,730
And they're also available
on a separate page

833
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,930
which is linked on the main page.

834
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,149
So, that's how you can get involved

835
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,100
and you can get as involved as you want

836
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,350
or as little as you want, it's up to you.

837
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,670
- Well, I have participated
in a few of the webinars

838
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,420
and I have been blown away by the level

839
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,690
of commitment and actually
just the expertise

840
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,956
of the people that are
volunteering in these programs.

841
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:07,980
It's unbelievable.

842
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,350
So, I highly encourage everybody

843
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,279
to follow Tom's lead there so,

844
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,320
well, we are out of time.

845
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,160
I'm gonna get the hook
here in a second now.

846
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,089
Thank you for joining.

847
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,450
I hope you maybe learned a little bit more

848
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,540
about supply chain, risk
management, DBOM, and SBOM.

849
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,340
And go look at the NTI
website and volunteer

850
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,173
and get involved.

851
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,189
Thank you all very much.
