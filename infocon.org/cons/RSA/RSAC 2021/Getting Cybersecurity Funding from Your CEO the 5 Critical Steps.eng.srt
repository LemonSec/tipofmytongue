1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,080
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,130
Thank you for coming to my talk at RSA

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,300
on Getting Cybersecurity
Funding from your CEO.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,550
A little bit about my background,

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,370
I have been in high tech
longer than I care to admit.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,580
I've been in cybersecurity
since 2006 with Commtouch.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,209
And then 10 years at
Kaspersky, my last job there

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,610
was running the government division,

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,070
which was very interesting.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,360
Then I went to Arctic Wolf, a
SOC-as-a-Service company run

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,419
by the founder of Blue Coat.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,720
And then I came to Microsoft,
and I've been at Microsoft

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,119
for a year now.

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,269
They call us ESEs, executive security

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,320
or security executives,
we talk about the end

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,880
to end platform that Microsoft has.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,350
And so I've broken this process down

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,760
into five critical steps.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,669
And I actually have worked a lot

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,040
with CEOs on cybersecurity strategy,

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,180
so I have a pretty good
idea of the way they think

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,410
about cybersecurity as a risk.

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,760
These are the five steps.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,940
Tailoring your communication to the person

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,949
you're getting budget from,
and we're gonna talk about it

26
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,490
like it's the CEO, but it
could be, in your case,

27
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,390
it could be your CIO.

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,920
Same rules apply.

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
You're gonna have two asks of them,

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,619
that's step number two, and
then you're gonna be running

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,530
a risk tolerance meeting.

32
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,960
We're gonna talk about
prioritizing all your solutions

33
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,660
by their return on investment

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,039
and then presenting the proposal.

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,160
The first thing, just as a level
set, we have to acknowledge

36
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,030
that the numbers here are pretty goofy.

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,870
It's really challenging
to determine the value

38
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,600
of something that didn't
happen, like what is the value

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,339
to the fact that we didn't
have a ransomware attack

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,220
in the last year, what
would it have cost us?

41
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
And so we have a challenge with that,

42
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,670
it's sort of like a thief
driving down the street trying

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,250
to figure out which house
they're gonna rob tonight.

44
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,610
You know, is it, did they
decide not to go pick your house

45
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,990
because of the fence that's around it

46
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,509
or because of the Rottweiler
in the front yard?

47
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,960
You know, which layer was it?

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,539
And of course, in security,
we're always wanting to put

49
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,566
as many layers as possible.

50
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:55,480
So figuring out which
exact thing was the foil

51
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,220
against the attacker is difficult.

52
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,700
So we have some goofy numbers,

53
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
but we've gotta start somewhere.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,290
It's kind of like wandering
around the desert, you know,

55
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,840
figuring out where you are
today has to be relative

56
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,450
to where you were yesterday.

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,810
So we gotta put a stake in the ground,

58
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,430
and I actually have a
book I could recommend

59
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,270
on measuring anything.

60
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,540
It's by Hubbard in Wiley Press

61
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,810
that does a lot of good stuff on that,

62
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,350
but we have to start measuring.

63
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,120
So that's really important.

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,170
Socializing the problem
is actually critical.

65
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,440
The only way we're gonna
stop these billions

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,970
of dollars that flow out of
the US all the time to hackers

67
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,710
is if we get everyone on
board with cybersecurity.

68
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,290
And when you start helping
executives understand

69
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,880
that they're high profile
targets personally and you,

70
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,820
you know, give them some advice

71
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,549
and assistance in protecting themselves

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,910
and they start to realize
that they don't want to be

73
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,560
with a company that then, oh, you were

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,770
with that company that got breached,

75
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,520
they start becoming more advocates

76
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,950
and modeling better
behavior for their teams,

77
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,730
which is the strongest correlation we have

78
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,230
for employees following security rules.

79
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,670
And this actually makes your
budgets so much more resistant

80
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,089
to going away when there's
downsizing and so forth,

81
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,260
because the other executives
are supporting the cause.

82
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,810
So really important to do that, and I love

83
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,770
to see the sharing results with peers.

84
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,940
Every CSO has the same challenges
that they're working with,

85
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,500
in fact, I sent my presentation this week

86
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,780
to Patrick Hellman, who's
a CSO over at Arrow,

87
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,340
it's at $28 billion
company, and he came back

88
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,640
with a couple of tips
I'm gonna mention later.

89
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,269
So tailoring your communication,

90
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,370
step number one, let's start there.

91
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,300
I kind of wanna call this sales.

92
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,850
But I know that there's some antipathy

93
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,390
that exists between, you
know, the typical technologist

94
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,779
and the salesperson and,
you know, for good reason.

95
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,020
You know, we've all heard
about the holy grail

96
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,430
of cyber that came and then
two and a half years later,

97
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,530
it ended up, well, not so great after all.

98
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,990
But it is persuasion,
it is really important

99
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,920
that you understand that this
is what you're trying to do,

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,570
and you're doing it for the best,

101
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,620
for what the company needs, right?

102
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,890
But there's an overwhelming
amount of data,

103
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,320
and I recommend Scott Adams'
Persuasion Reading List

104
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,850
that he put out, you know, the
creator of Dilbert, in 2016,

105
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,489
it's got some good stuff on there.

106
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,340
Daniel Kahneman's Think Fast, Think Slow

107
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,570
is my favorite one, it's pretty
dense, but it's excellent.

108
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,390
All this data showing that
humans actually usually act

109
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,339
and choose based on their emotions

110
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,399
and what makes them feel good

111
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,310
and then they rationalize
very quickly after the fact.

112
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,530
So it's useful to understand that.

113
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,460
But we do overwhelmingly also think

114
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,510
that we are rational and
other people are rational.

115
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,610
So understand who it is
that you're selling to

116
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,270
to the best of your ability.

117
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,150
One really easy way to break people

118
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,929
into like four pretty simple categories

119
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,550
is this driver, expressive,
analytic, amiable.

120
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,610
You can find a lot of
information out there about it,

121
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,210
but it does help you understand,

122
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,090
do they make decisions quick or slow?

123
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,890
Do they want more data or less data?

124
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,530
But what trumps all of
that is talking to somebody

125
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,909
who actually gets their
budgets approved by that CEO.

126
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,850
So if you have somebody in your
company that regularly gets

127
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,190
what they need and what they want,

128
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,640
then that's the person that you talk to.

129
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
And your discussion is I'd
like to see the company

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,150
be more cybersecure.

131
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,409
I'm afraid I'm gonna need to
ask for a little more budget,

132
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,920
and I'd be really interested in hearing

133
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,990
from you how you succeeded at that.

134
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,530
So that would be the best
thing that you could do

135
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,109
if you can get somebody on your side

136
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,163
and get someone's support with that.

137
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,049
You do need to understand
where the CEO is coming from.

138
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,030
They think in these terms,
they care about market share,

139
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,909
profit and loss, revenue.

140
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,920
And they think about
risks to the business.

141
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,570
And I created a CEO coaching class

142
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,599
called Cybersecurity Strategy
for CEOs that I still give

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,090
on a pro bono basis at Microsoft.

144
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,570
And I did that for a few years,

145
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,770
so I've talked to a lot of
CEOs about cybersecurity risk,

146
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,440
and I understand that most
of them do not put them up.

147
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,370
they don't elevate cybersecurity risks

148
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,880
to the level of financial,
legal, market risk

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,010
that they're used to dealing with,

150
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,020
and we have to get them thinking that way.

151
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,349
So part of this whole
conversation is getting them

152
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,330
to realize that's what they need to do.

153
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,690
They also, of course, these
other things matter to them,

154
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,840
but that's the single
most important thing.

155
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,470
This actually used to be a
discussion about 10 years ago

156
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,960
or so in cybersecurity,
there were people that said

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,969
we shouldn't be selling FUD,
you know, fear, uncertainty,

158
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,000
and doubt as a way to inspire people

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,310
to buy more cybersecurity, but it's hardly

160
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,690
an argument anymore.

161
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,210
That was more on the days
where people, you know,

162
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,510
thought that the risk wasn't as great

163
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,900
as we could see, those
of us who were insiders.

164
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,530
It's just the strongest motivator,

165
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,320
and especially when you have weak measures

166
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,800
of correlation between
you didn't get attacked

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,730
and what exactly the fault was.

168
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,780
So it is the biggest reason
to invest in cybersecurity,

169
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,659
so we've gotta use it.

170
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,030
You do want executives to appreciate

171
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,669
that they should be a little
bit nervous about the fact

172
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,540
that hackers want them and
their access to the company,

173
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,360
but you don't wanna overwhelm them.

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,130
If you go too deep into
a nation state situation,

175
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,810
that can happen, people can
get kind of frozen with fear.

176
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,120
One recommendation Patrick
made to me this week was,

177
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,330
if you can come up with
an example of a breach

178
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,840
that happened, maybe a business
email compromise attack,

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,710
ransomware or something in your industry,

180
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,440
and then you can share details of that

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,850
as you're talking to your executives

182
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,003
to what you wanna do and
how you wanna avoid that,

183
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:14,750
that that could be really helpful.

184
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,070
And then he also mentioned
on timing, 'cause of course,

185
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,040
you have to choose your timing carefully.

186
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,260
Don't ask for, you know, extra people

187
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,800
when the company is having a downsizing.

188
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,690
But when there is
something big that happens

189
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,640
in your industry that's scary,

190
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
that gets the executives' attention,

191
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,550
that's a pretty good time to
go back and ask for more stuff.

192
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,180
And then just make sure you
use their time wisely, right?

193
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,490
Because we're talking about, you know,

194
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,200
your 15 minutes with the
CEO, with the executives,

195
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,599
you wanna have a good pithy presentation.

196
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,330
So the CEO asks, there's two of them.

197
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,820
And this is the process of helping the CEO

198
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,950
and the other executives
really organize their thoughts

199
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,830
around cybersecurity risk.

200
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,370
The first ask is so simple.

201
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,290
It's I'd like to present a strategy

202
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,650
for optimizing our cybersecurity posture.

203
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,193
Now, what CEO says, no,
I don't wanna see that?

204
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,290
But this is part, the
beginning of the conversation

205
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,980
where you try to get them to understand,

206
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,080
we will never get to zero
risk in cybersecurity.

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,690
This is something that I know,
because I talk to CEOs a lot,

208
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,020
that they don't understand,
and I really try to drive home

209
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,260
in that three hour conversation
that I have with them,

210
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,890
we'll never get to zero.

211
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,930
Because it's not so hard to
secure one thing that's separate

212
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,910
from the world where it's static.

213
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,270
But as soon as you have this entity,

214
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,190
this thriving business
that's got ingress, egress

215
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,210
of data and people and email
and services and things,

216
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,340
that's the problem that you have.

217
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,580
You'll just never get to zero
risk when that's happening

218
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,260
at the speed that we need it to happen

219
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,409
for successful business.

220
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,300
So what we need to do as
a company, you'll explain

221
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,290
to your CEO, is decide
what the tolerable level

222
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,329
of that risk is for the company.

223
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,170
And then we'll transfer what's left

224
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,500
and we'll get cyberinsurance
to cover the risks

225
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,140
that we can't control 100%.

226
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,290
Do be ready in that
conversation for the CEO

227
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,319
to ask you the question,
is this gonna cost me a lot

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,410
of money, are you gonna ask for more

229
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,060
than your budget or
whatever, and figure out

230
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,089
what you're gonna say about that.

231
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,310
Like if you want to let them know, well,

232
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,900
we might need a little
more than last year,

233
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,630
or I don't know yet, I'm working
on it, or just be prepared

234
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,980
to answer that question when it comes up,

235
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,760
don't let it surprise you.

236
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,110
You are, you can either
communicate this to the CEO or not.

237
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,640
But these are gonna be the
elements of your conversation.

238
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,199
And typically, a CEO would
say, if they have the time,

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
you know, what is it that
you're gonna bring me?

240
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
You're gonna clarify the current posture.

241
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,960
You're gonna decide
what the risk tolerance

242
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,870
is for the company that you're,

243
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,170
and then you're gonna work with legal

244
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,772
and finance to figure out
what the cyberinsurance,

245
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,080
what guidelines you should have

246
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,970
for transferring what's left.

247
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,060
You'll present options, I
always recommend three options,

248
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,469
'cause all of the studies
on human psychology tells us

249
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,110
that people can go back and
forth between two options.

250
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,480
They decide a lot faster
when you have three

251
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,730
and 70 plus percent of
people typically take

252
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,630
the middle option.

253
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:04,120
So just to hurry along the
decision to give you budget,

254
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,163
I like a good, better, best
scenario, but it's up to you.

255
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,380
You'll be setting a strategy
and tactics to get there,

256
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,930
of course, then you'll confirm
your budget and move forward.

257
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,599
And the very last question is,

258
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,350
is anything missing from this list?

259
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,376
CEOs answer to somebody too, or your CIO

260
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:23,230
is answering to the CEO,
and they'll be aware

261
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,060
of the fact that these
other people they answer to

262
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,849
might want something
else in addition to this.

263
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,430
So that's a good question
to finish up with.

264
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,449
The second ask of the
CEO is this conversation

265
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,320
around gaining executive
alignment and the fact

266
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,460
that you wanna meet with
your peers and you wanna talk

267
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,940
about what's our risk tolerance
as a company, what is,

268
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
what makes the most sense?

269
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,880
And there's all these
ways that IT security

270
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,700
can help these other departments,

271
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,060
and these conversations typically

272
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,770
aren't happening at companies
and it's really disappointing.

273
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,480
Legal and operations, how is
it that they're gonna decide

274
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,750
how much cyberinsurance to buy?

275
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,470
And they do this all the time
without ever talking to IT.

276
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,210
Like how do they know
what the probability is

277
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,330
of getting this kind of a
breach and what the costs were,

278
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,590
I mean, have they looked at the data,

279
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,220
do they know how many records there are?

280
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,560
Things like that, so you can help legal

281
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,910
and operations a lot.

282
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,579
You can also help finance,
finance is where, of course,

283
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,900
all the business email
compromise attacks occur

284
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,170
and huge losses in that sector.

285
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,310
And so that's another place
you should be helping them

286
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,250
and you should be having conversations.

287
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,500
HR, I love to see better
communication between HR

288
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,550
and IT side, because they need
to be telling you two weeks

289
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,900
before they fire people,
because that's when most,

290
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,630
if you have a malicious
person who's gonna steal stuff

291
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,590
that's typically, you know,
most of it's stolen that time,

292
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,990
they need to make sure that
the employee education happens

293
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,100
and they're doing background
checks and so forth.

294
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,490
Manufacturing production.

295
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,450
We know those are famously,
people can be masters at running

296
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,770
that machinery, but they tend
to be relatively low tech,

297
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,270
and of those, machines
were often not built

298
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,590
with security in mind.

299
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,840
So lots of vulnerability
there that we need

300
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,870
to help them manage.

301
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,960
And then operations, operations has

302
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,820
this widespread privilege
across the company.

303
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,480
And something that we
really need to, you know,

304
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,080
least privilege is the perfect fit there.

305
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,820
So now let's talk about running
this risk tolerance meeting.

306
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,170
And then I just, I do wanna say,

307
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,270
please ask questions along the way here,

308
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,500
'cause I know we're moving
pretty fast through the topics,

309
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,883
and I'll do my best to answer as we go.

310
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,240
So running the risk tolerance meeting,

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,750
you really want your
executives to walk out

312
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,110
of this meeting understanding
how competent your group is.

313
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,350
And the fact that we are living
with risk every single day,

314
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,120
challenged by a really
extreme environment.

315
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,360
And also help them understand
what they have to lose.

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,650
They don't wanna be associated
with a breach, right?

317
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,430
They don't want it to have
come from their department.

318
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,300
And in a perfect world,

319
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,229
I actually published something
yesterday on LinkedIn

320
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,640
that has a list of things
that you can hand out

321
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,300
to executives, you know,
being safer personally

322
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,979
with their families, which
will get their attention.

323
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,450
So you wanna gain their cooperation.

324
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,210
Please be sure that you don't
assume they know anything.

325
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,190
And this is very helpful to make sure,

326
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,350
if you have more than
one person in a room,

327
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,640
you can make things really
simple, it's easier,

328
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,290
it's a little less of an ego
hit maybe, you know, that they,

329
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,900
someone can say you're simplifying
it for this other person.

330
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,370
But one other thing that
Patrick said is when you know

331
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,250
who supports you and
who doesn't support you

332
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,750
among your peers, you
kind of wanna carve out

333
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,860
the one who doesn't support you

334
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,510
and have that meeting on
your own and then allow,

335
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,960
when you have a group
of people and you know

336
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,920
that somebody is a good
supporter, have them, you know,

337
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,420
ask questions or do
things that can help raise

338
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,430
the value of that meeting
for you with other execs.

339
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,290
So assume that they don't know technology.

340
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,060
And you have to have this zero
risk conversation with them,

341
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,619
and we're gonna talk about
getting over the risk line.

342
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,540
Most executives do not know
how much influence they have

343
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,870
over their teams in terms of
how they adhere to things.

344
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,200
So we do need to talk
about metrics, you want to,

345
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,830
in all these conversations, talk about

346
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,520
how well your organization is doing.

347
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,990
And you've gotta go find out
where those dashboards are.

348
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,720
You know, like Microsoft,
you can put one subscription,

349
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,220
Azure, you can turn on
Azure Security Center

350
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,980
and you've got a metric, but every cloud

351
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,380
has something like that that
they can also reach to the prem

352
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,810
or to other clouds and
you can get scoring.

353
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,030
So that's something you can use,

354
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,160
but you wanna compare to last
month, to industry peers,

355
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,620
especially against a framework.

356
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,430
And of course, NIST is the, you know,

357
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,512
the godfather of all frameworks.

358
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,130
How many FTE hours are
committed to things?

359
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,080
Another way to measure it
is your rate of resolution.

360
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,750
You know, we solved 114 critical
alerts, that kind of thing.

361
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,500
And then make sure you're using the data

362
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,880
that supports your goals, right?

363
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,490
In terms of saying we have a
competent team and then we,

364
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,240
but we do have these gaps in coverage,

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,490
these certain things
are taking our time away

366
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,930
from places that my people
are skilled to work in,

367
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,920
but just can't because we
don't have the right tools.

368
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,030
This is an excellent
whiteboard conversation.

369
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,209
And so you're gonna draw this
spectrum on the whiteboard.

370
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,870
And you're gonna help
them, this is the beginning

371
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,670
of them understanding
that you'll never get

372
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,310
to zero cybersecurity risk.

373
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,619
And so this comes from, if you think

374
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,430
about like BitSight and UpGuard
and some of those, you know,

375
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,189
secure score companies
that give you a percentage

376
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,130
of scoring, very often, they'll start

377
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,050
when they're scoring your
suppliers with like 1000 points.

378
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,319
And then they'll say under 600 points

379
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,640
is where we see all our breaches,

380
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
so that's where this comes from.

381
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,010
What you could argue in
that case and the data

382
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,860
that they seem to collectively agree on

383
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,810
is that the range where
most breaches happen

384
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,729
is below that threshold.

385
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,650
So bankruptcies are happening
right around the 20 to 30%.

386
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,380
When you get up to that
60%, you know, 50 maybe,

387
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,689
you've got a public breach that, you know,

388
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,520
causes a lot of harm to
the company potentially.

389
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,670
The sweet spot is over 60%.

390
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,920
And so 67 to 80 is really nice

391
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,949
if the company is willing
to spend that much money,

392
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,240
and that can make them feel really good

393
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,970
that they're in that spectrum.

394
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,060
63 to 73 is roughly where a
lot of companies say, okay,

395
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,810
we're comfortable with that.

396
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,729
So this is just kind of a level set,

397
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,320
and again, back to the squishy numbers,

398
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,950
we're just trying to
guide the conversation

399
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,810
to help them understand that we're dealing

400
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,160
with a situation that is
never gonna be zero risk.

401
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,829
So when a breach happens,
they're not looking

402
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,640
at us saying you failed.

403
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,890
They're saying the
company failed as a whole.

404
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,620
That's where you wanna get people to.

405
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,790
And when we think about
getting over the risk line,

406
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,000
it's really opportunistic hacking,

407
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,930
we wanna get way above that.

408
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,479
And so you can say most companies

409
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,870
in our industry are
operating at this level,

410
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,020
there's been this huge growth
that kind of leveled out

411
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,920
after 2017 in terms of
new threats every day.

412
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,433
Hackers only work that
hard, right, their fees.

413
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,500
They're driven by return on investment.

414
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
We just need to get people there.

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,390
We need to get executives there personally

416
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,720
because of the kind of
attack they're under

417
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,330
and how they look to hackers, and we need

418
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,740
to get the company there.

419
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,100
So these are the two kind of
whiteboarding conversations.

420
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,870
I would say if you're
starting with a number,

421
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,050
'cause a lot of these people
won't have an opinion,

422
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,200
you're kind of educating
them as you talk to them,

423
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,869
just pick 75% and say, let's
say 75% is where we wanna be.

424
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,540
That means we're gonna need
to buy enough cyberinsurance

425
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,780
to handle the 25% of residual risk, right?

426
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,530
And then when you think
about what does that take

427
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,240
to get there, you know, you can talk

428
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,010
through this with who
whoever's in the room,

429
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,410
but which frameworks you're
gonna use, the tools.

430
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,080
Especially tools that have massive amount

431
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,470
of telemetry behind them.

432
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,920
Like a company that has, you know,

433
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,630
trillions of data signals
and that can tell you,

434
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,920
this is how you look, this is
how your score looks compared

435
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,020
to the same size company
or the same industry

436
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,180
or the same geography, so very useful.

437
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,080
But do trust your intuition, this is,

438
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,409
there's a lot of place for intuition here

439
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,530
and experience and talking to your peers.

440
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,570
And also, there's two
ways to build a budget.

441
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,850
You can go from the
bottom up or the top down,

442
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,000
depending on industry expectations.

443
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,230
So how much cyberinsurance?

444
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,280
Transferring residual risk.

445
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,870
We're not gonna spend
a lot of time on this,

446
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,540
but these are the things that
you can help the finance group

447
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,420
or the operations group with,
is ransomware very often

448
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,640
is seven days out of, you
know, of business losses

449
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,550
if the, you know, the
backups fail and everything,

450
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,250
and then there's an average ransom size.

451
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,980
Personal information, $150 a record

452
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,760
is not a bad thing to use.

453
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,200
So you multiply these
times the probability

454
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,163
and you get to some sort of a number.

455
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,730
So now, prioritizing
cybersecurity solutions

456
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,153
by the return on investment.

457
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,050
There's four criteria.

458
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,919
There's three tables and
then there's the final,

459
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,670
those roll into the final ROI table.

460
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,590
And so the first thing is the timeframe,

461
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,100
you pick a timeframe that's
common to all of them.

462
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,179
And you could see how,
if you've got something

463
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,820
that's costing you a
million dollars upfront

464
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,830
but then that work, you don't
have to pay anything else

465
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,990
for a couple of years, the
timeframe really matters

466
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,620
that you're measuring
that against a product

467
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,919
that's $100,000 every single month.

468
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,460
So picking your timeframe
is gonna go a long way

469
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,090
to sort of skewing where
you wanna go with your plan.

470
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,260
So pick a timeframe
that all of the products

471
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,010
that you're measuring, you hold them to,

472
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,940
and then there's these tables.

473
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,800
The first one is the cost table.

474
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,310
And of course, when you're
talking about costs,

475
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,929
you have capital expenditures

476
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,940
and you have operational expenditures.

477
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,160
And take a look at that if
you don't know the difference,

478
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,300
but cap ex generally is
you buy something upfront

479
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,750
and it doesn't, the cost
doesn't change based

480
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,840
on how much you use it,
operational expense,

481
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,139
it varies according to
how much you use it.

482
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,290
And then you do absolutely wanna make sure

483
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,210
you're including the ongoing costs.

484
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,850
And that's where you don't wanna listen

485
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,879
to the salespeople too much.

486
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,870
You wanna go out to user
groups and things and talk

487
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,060
to peers that are using it and say,

488
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,760
do their patches roll out in a timely way,

489
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,080
are they easy to use, is
there a lot of downtime,

490
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,040
or how often do they completely
redesign the dashboard

491
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,490
so that I have to retrain my people?

492
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,690
Those are important things
on the ongoing cost.

493
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,663
And then externalities is
also another thing to capture.

494
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,070
A lot of times you have a new product,

495
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,780
you're gonna have to
integrate it with other things

496
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,540
or you'll have to decommission something.

497
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,210
And there are costs
involved in that, right,

498
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,470
if you're gonna rip and replace.

499
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,350
So make sure that you
accommodate that in your budget

500
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,459
and in the total hours that
you need for people to help.

501
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,480
The last two tables are
one is necessity/urgency

502
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,950
and the other one is impact.

503
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,340
And so just to describe the difference.

504
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,169
The necessity one is I've got
a gap that nothing else can,

505
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,590
is, you know, we've gotta
have something that covers it,

506
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,320
and so that's pretty urgent.

507
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,010
And the overlapping control, of course,

508
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,140
we have lots of layer
controls and security.

509
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,670
So that's the second level.

510
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,130
And then the third level is redundant.

511
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,490
I think the redundant,
one of the best ways

512
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,020
to use redundant, because the
redundant stuff's gonna go

513
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,800
to the bottom of your
list, one of the best ways

514
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,530
is when you don't wanna make a move.

515
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,540
Like I'll give you an example of a company

516
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,870
where an executive came in.

517
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,560
They had something that was working great.

518
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,629
And this executive came
in from another company,

519
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,280
and she sat on the board of a company

520
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,149
that did something similar to this product

521
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,530
they had just integrated.

522
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,160
And the system was perfectly
happy with what they had,

523
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,670
but then there was the request

524
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,850
that they consider this other thing.

525
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,500
Well, it just kept going to the bottom

526
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,660
of the stack because it's so redundant

527
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,610
and it would cost extra
to rip and replace.

528
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,949
And so when that person
left two years later,

529
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,060
they still hadn't had to make a move.

530
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,260
So that's how you can use redundant.

531
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,050
The estimated impact on cybersecurity,

532
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,240
how powerful is the solution, right?

533
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,940
And that's the most intuitive one.

534
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,850
But together, you roll these
in and they become our ROI.

535
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,240
Here's the first table with cost ranking.

536
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
The way I recommend this is you take

537
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,640
the most expensive item,
let's suppose it's $800,000.

538
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,840
And you say, let's just go
up from that a little bit

539
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,760
to a million and let's
break it apart by five.

540
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,990
So that every dollar
sign here is one fifth.

541
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,930
So it's $200,000.

542
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,900
So you're, if you look at C here,

543
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,180
C cost $200,000 as an upfront cost.

544
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,090
The ongoing cost over the timeframe

545
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,570
that we've picked is $400,000.

546
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,149
B is exactly the opposite, B
is costing us $400,000 upfront,

547
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,950
but 100,000 over time, and so they end up

548
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,060
with the same score.

549
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,210
So that's how this works.

550
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,530
And I'm making this very simple,

551
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,330
you can make it as
complicated as you want.

552
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,010
If you wanna break this down
into 30 different, you know,

553
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,813
segments of expense, you can do that.

554
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,230
The next table is the
necessity/urgency, and again,

555
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,720
we have gap closure is a singular,

556
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,730
and that's the top number.

557
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,120
Then you have overlapping control,

558
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,169
so here you have our four
choices ranked that way.

559
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,963
So necessity/urgency.

560
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,310
And then we have how powerful it is.

561
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,889
This is, again, the most intuitive one.

562
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,480
This is informed by IT's experience,

563
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,150
the stuff that you found
out there that people

564
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,670
are talking about, product
reviews, et cetera.

565
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,400
Basically what's the
projected effectiveness.

566
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,380
And again, you can separate this

567
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,920
into as many different
categories as you want.

568
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,570
I just took five here to make it simple.

569
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,409
And then now let's take all the numbers

570
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,360
and roll it into our final table

571
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,800
and where the lowest
number scores the highest.

572
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,450
And now we've got these
four different things

573
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,980
that you wanna add to your network

574
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,410
over the next six months
to three years or whatever.

575
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,550
And they're ranked in order of priority.

576
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,520
And so you can choose that to be the way

577
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,293
that you implement or deploy.

578
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,920
So now let's talk about how
you present this proposal.

579
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,930
Enhancing aspects, we want to bring

580
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,530
this problem to life, right?

581
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,690
So having a story is great, and it can be

582
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,670
the business email compromise,
ransomware or data theft,

583
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,190
those are really the three things

584
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,800
that people get most upset about

585
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,040
or that has the most potential
to destroy a company.

586
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,360
Nobody wants this to happen,
and we're pretty much looking

587
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,409
at this is the challenge, the
environment that we exist in.

588
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,250
You've already set up the fact that zero,

589
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,450
we can't get to zero risk.

590
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,320
And so including that, here's
what failure looks like,

591
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,659
and then here's what we need to do, right?

592
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,650
We've already said, okay, we
think the risk tolerance level

593
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,920
that's reasonable is 75%, unless somebody

594
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,550
has a different idea than that
and the steps to get there.

595
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,500
So these are the five sections.

596
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,510
There's a leave-behind, this is part one,

597
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,129
and then two more after this.

598
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,660
The very first part is the
current state, existing gaps,

599
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,820
right, your description
of what's happening

600
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,560
and the acceptable level of risk.

601
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,550
Then you are gonna talk about,

602
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,780
here's the recommended
enhancements, you have your list.

603
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,180
And this satisfies drivers who don't tend

604
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,640
to be very detail-oriented,
you have all that stuff upfront

605
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,730
and you have all the detail behind it

606
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,580
for the analytics or anyone
who wants to dive in after.

607
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,091
So you've got that over
your period of time,

608
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:32,820
you've got your ROI ranking
and the deployment schedule.

609
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,389
And then, the thing about this

610
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,460
when it comes to the pricing
is you wanna be realistic,

611
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,630
but you don't have to
include every possible thing.

612
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,570
There's a tendency for, a lot of IT people

613
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,020
can be more on the analytical side

614
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,290
and there's a tendency to
wanna put everything in there.

615
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,310
You wanna be a little bit
less thorough than that

616
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,440
if it's gonna hurt your chance

617
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,083
of getting your budget approved.

618
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,870
The other, number four
is three options, again,

619
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,370
there's a couple of ways
I've represented this

620
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,560
in this presentation, you
know, good, better, best,

621
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,270
minimum, adequate, best,
whatever, however you wanna do it.

622
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,980
Three is a great way to go
unless you have information

623
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,340
about your CEO that tells you differently.

624
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,620
And you also always want to
be, as you're communicating

625
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,969
with the executives and the CEO,

626
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,570
mindful of what you are putting
across about your department

627
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,340
and the fact that you're
already maximizing your use

628
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,830
of current resources, right?

629
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,429
You've made this kind of progress,

630
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,410
by the way, over this time period.

631
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,380
One way, by the way, to
get the executives on board

632
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,940
with that and excited is to say, hey,

633
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,300
I'd like to have another meeting,

634
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,830
and one of the things I'm gonna share

635
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,270
is how much better your group has done

636
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,700
in the phish testing than last time.

637
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,730
And they love that kind of recognition.

638
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,750
So progress over time period,
our ongoing commitment

639
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,520
as a group and raising awareness

640
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,410
and working cross-departmentally.

641
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,740
And then quick wins, and
let's talk about freebies,

642
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,790
what we mean by that.

643
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,700
When you talk about
things that you're doing

644
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,610
that are kind of free
to the company, I mean,

645
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,949
nothing's really free but kind of,

646
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,310
it definitely demonstrates
cost sensitivity

647
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,000
and the idea that you're
really leaning in.

648
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,820
And so you think about things like

649
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,210
just deploying least privilege, right?

650
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,400
It doesn't take a lot to do that,

651
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,730
you just need permission to do it.

652
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,260
Or purging sensitive data that you know

653
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,980
is on the network that
doesn't need to be there

654
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,750
'cause marketing keeps
saying they're gonna mine it.

655
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,190
But if you lose it, there's, you know,

656
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,760
lots of liability involved,
so let's just, you know,

657
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,690
pull that off, stick it
on a drive, encrypt it,

658
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,080
and put it in a safe somewhere.

659
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,370
If you can just get the agreement

660
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,300
from the CEO to do those kinds of things,

661
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,490
it doesn't take much to do it

662
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,820
and it significantly reduces your risk.

663
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,970
So you can bring your risk
down by percentage points

664
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,520
by doing these simple things.

665
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,800
Obviously, security
training and awareness.

666
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,139
And then don't be afraid
to ask your vendors.

667
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,980
And if you don't feel
comfortable doing it,

668
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,310
have procurement do it,
but when you're thinking

669
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,320
about buying a new product,
when you get the go ahead

670
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,710
and you've got some budget,
ask them what they have

671
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,630
to provide you with skilling initiatives,

672
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,110
any kind of training for your people.

673
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,889
They have the proof of concept funding

674
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,490
where they can give you free ingests

675
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,260
during the time you're, you know, going,

676
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,360
jumping through hoops and stuff.

677
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,983
So ask for all of that that you can get.

678
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,649
And then when you think
about your own team,

679
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,330
when you can get dollars
from another budget, take it.

680
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,020
Like a lot of times, HR will talk about,

681
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,050
will have extra money to help,
you know, with credentials

682
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,990
and anyone, or team activities, right,

683
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,640
like a capture the flag
game or helping anybody

684
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,290
in your team who wants to skill up.

685
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,280
And you know the problem
we have in cybersecurity,

686
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,240
there's just so many jobs
and so few people, right?

687
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,950
So just the idea that we
have anyone that wants to be

688
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,970
in our organization and skill up,

689
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,730
it's just a great way to
train your future sales force.

690
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,750
And then this is more about
keeping the job interesting,

691
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,670
because talking to Patrick
and also the CSO over

692
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,260
at Honeywell, it's just over time,

693
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,350
you're doing the same
thing over and over again.

694
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,969
It's nice to add some of these things in

695
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,003
like physical security,
right, or industrial IoT,

696
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,629
that whole manufacturing floor stuff

697
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,640
or even supplier management compliance,

698
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,820
all of these things could legitimately go

699
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,787
into the cybersecurity
or IT security group

700
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:05,560
if that's your interest, and of course,

701
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,373
your budget will increase accordingly.

702
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,350
So finally, what we've
learned today, applying it.

703
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,490
In an ideal scenario, we are,
you're talking to somebody

704
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,960
you're meeting right away
potentially with, we hope.

705
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,020
Somebody that has had successes with CEO

706
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,950
that can give you some
ideas about the best way

707
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,380
to work with them.

708
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,480
You are going to assemble the components

709
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,360
of your message and you're, of course,

710
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,240
starting with your current
cybersecurity posture,

711
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,940
all the tools that you've got there.

712
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,240
You are looking at the kinds of dashboards

713
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,940
and metrics that you have access to.

714
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,740
And starting with those, you're gonna work

715
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,330
on all the missing pieces, like what is it

716
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,240
that you think are the
most important to bring in?

717
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,360
And then the week after,
it's a great time to meet

718
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,560
with the CEO and then
just say, wanna, you know,

719
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,510
talk about posture and would love

720
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,870
to have this risk tolerance meeting.

721
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,979
Presumably, if the CEO
thinks that's a good idea,

722
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,010
they might have some timing
of their own, you know,

723
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,160
like we'll wait until after this or that.

724
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,870
And then in the next two
to six months after that,

725
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,389
meeting with key executives, and again,

726
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,800
that's together or separately,

727
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,210
depending on who you feel
are your biggest supporters.

728
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,300
It's great if you have a few new people

729
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,030
to make sure they're in the room

730
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,080
with the people that support you the best.

731
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,199
And then you're gonna
rank your priorities,

732
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,040
go through all of the ROIs,
make sure that it works out

733
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,800
the way that you want it to.

734
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,770
And then make sure that you,
whatever you're presenting,

735
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,557
whether it's to the CEO or
to the other executives,

736
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:35,950
and you know, test it against
somebody who's willing

737
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,200
to take, put on the hat of the people

738
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,600
who run that department or
who are looking at risks

739
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
the same way that the CEO will be.

740
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,399
And then you're presenting your proposal

741
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,900
and your budget request.

742
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,640
And then over the next six months,

743
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,370
you're doing all the work, right?

744
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,389
Launching your proof of
concept, closing your gaps,

745
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,100
budgeting effectively, sharing process.

746
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,080
And then talking to peers, hopefully,

747
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,580
about how we can all do
this better in the future.

748
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:08,130
So thank you so much
for attending this talk.

749
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,830
And please reach out on LinkedIn

750
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,220
if you have questions at
all, and I'll look forward

751
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,670
to answering whatever
other questions that I can.
