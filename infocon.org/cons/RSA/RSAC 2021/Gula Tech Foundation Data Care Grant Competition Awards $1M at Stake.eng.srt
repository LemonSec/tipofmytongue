1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,980
- Alrighty, well, hey, welcome

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,480
to the ''2021 Gula Tech
Foundation award ceremony''

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,780
and we are going to be
awarding a variety of awards

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,139
that we call Data Care
Awards for organizations

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,020
and nonprofits that increase
cybersecurity awareness.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,090
- Yeah, data care has been a term

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,800
that we've been gravitating to because

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,190
when we're looking at the
workforce development shortage

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,180
how do we get more people
engaged in cybersecurity?

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,970
We're trying to use and change
the terminology to data care

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,900
to try to make it more personal,
to get people's attention

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,930
and understand that they have
a personal responsibility

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,660
to help with national
security and national defense

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,139
but their own defense.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,280
And then turnaround companies
also have the responsibility

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,700
to protect the data that
they have been provided

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,623
with by the public.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,310
- So today we're going to
talk a little bit about

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,019
why we need public
cybersecurity awareness,

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,740
even though we just had
the Colonial Pipeline

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,573
and we're doing this

22
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:09,839
at the largest cybersecurity
conference in the world.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,790
We're gonna announce our winners,

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,080
we have four runners up and
we also have a first place,

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,620
second place, and a third place winner.

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,630
We're gonna hear from
each of those winners.

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,610
And then as Cindy said, we're
gonna go in a little bit

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,460
if we have time to talk a little bit more

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,929
about our data care initiative.

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,530
- And keeping in mind these
were competitive grants,

31
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,530
so people, organizations
put their programs forward

32
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,210
and we had the ability to vet
and look at a wide variety

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,762
of submissions to come
up with these winners.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,650
- So for those of you attending

35
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,560
who don't know who we
are, this is Cyndi Gula.

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
- Hi, I'm Cyndi.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,160
- I'm, Ron Gula, we run
Gula Tech Adventures.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,560
And we named it adventures

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,130
because we were actually involved

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,070
in a number of different things

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,610
in the cybersecurity industry.

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,410
We have a foundation called
the Gula Tech Foundation,

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,399
which is focused on
philanthropy and cybersecurity.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,520
Gula Tech Adventures is
our venture capital arm,

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,539
we invest in a lot of great companies.

46
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,730
You'll see a lot of
these companies at RSA.

47
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,489
People probably saw
Bryson Bort from SCYTHE,

48
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,710
for example, on a number of conferences

49
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,430
or one of our portfolio companies there.

50
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,280
And then we also have our own show called,

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
Gula Tech Cyber Fiction

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,870
because we're both science fiction nerds.

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,820
And we really actually
think science fiction,

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,920
has actually dealt with a
lot of the different social

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,019
and technological struggles
that we're dealing with today

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,023
in cyber security.

57
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,430
- So in January, we had a grant

58
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,470
like another competitive
grant, a million dollars,

59
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,304
looking to find nonprofits
that were engaged

60
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:52,132
in increasing African-American
engagement in cybersecurity.

61
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:57,132
Diversity is a very big effort
of pretty much the industry

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,310
and there's very specific
terminology backgrounds

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,257
and things that we recognize

64
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:10,250
and we wanna be a lot more
inclusive and inviting.

65
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,700
And so we really wanted to support

66
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,489
the top three organizations which each,

67
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,670
where the first place was 500,000,

68
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,019
the second was 300,000 and
the third place was 200,000.

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,720
And you can go to our website, gula.tech

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,640
to look more into those organizations.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,783
If you wanna get involved,
that would be great,

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,483
education is very local and personal.

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,480
So again, the more that we can do

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,799
the more we can amplify
and get great people

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,660
in cyber engaged with the
public will be better.

76
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,907
- And doing that grant,

77
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,640
and it's more than just giving money,

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,739
I mean, we're happy to give

79
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,530
but it was about highlighting
what they were doing

80
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,240
and bringing them to the media,

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,140
introducing to the sort
of our network of funds

82
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,609
and companies we're working with.

83
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,800
And one of the things that happened

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,100
is we got the attention
of the RSA Conference.

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,150
So I think Cyndi and I
just wanna thank everybody

86
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,270
at the RSA Conference for being able

87
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,590
to run this Gula Tech
Foundation award ceremony

88
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,180
during the conference and
getting that kind of exposure.

89
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,110
So we couldn't do this,

90
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,430
it's not just the Ron and Cyndi show,

91
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,110
we actually have a board
of foundation advisors.

92
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,280
We have an advisory board,
a wide variety of names

93
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,130
I'm not gonna go through them all here

94
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,469
but it's a diverse group
of folks from academia,

95
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,050
folks from government,
folks from industries,

96
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,560
and folks from nonprofit land.

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,370
And we have an internal process
where we select maybe 10%,

98
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,760
20% of all of our submissions

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,030
and then our foundation board

100
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,419
they actually pick the winners.

101
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,020
So we try to make a way that's
non conflicted and whatnot,

102
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,152
but we couldn't do this without them.

103
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:55,120
I just wanted to acknowledge
who these people are,

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,350
and again, thank them for their help

105
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,480
'cause it makes our job a lot easier

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,640
because everybody's a winner.

107
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,560
I mean, everybody's doing good work,

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,750
trying to pick the foundation,

109
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,070
trying to pick the nonprofits
that make the most impact

110
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,522
it was hard work and we
couldn't do it without them.

111
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,430
- So this grant,

112
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,350
was increasing public
cybersecurity awareness,

113
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,610
again, wrap it around data
care, whatever we could do

114
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,900
and it wasn't limited to
a geographic location.

115
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,900
It wasn't limited to K-12
education or other demographics.

116
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,940
It was open to everybody
because this is going to be

117
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,600
one of the driving factors that we see

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,210
is the more public engagement we can have,

119
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,810
the more successful cybersecurity
companies are going to be,

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,830
the national security,

121
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,349
that the government's
doing is going to be.

122
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,882
So we just really need all hands on deck

123
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:54,610
and we were really happy
to see the wide variety

124
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,783
of applications that we did get.

125
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,900
- So today we're gonna be announcing

126
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,429
a million dollars in grants
across seven winners.

127
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,710
We have four runners up, nobody
wants to be fourth place,

128
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,599
fifth place or seven place
but we have four runners up

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,810
they're each gonna get a $100,000 each.

130
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,720
And we also have third
place, second place,

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,010
and first place getting a 150, 200, 250K

132
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,480
we're all in cybersecurity,
if the add all this stuff

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,010
it comes to a million dollars.

134
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,789
But it's more than just the
money, it's the exposure.

135
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,060
If anybody out there is
watching and wants to learn

136
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,680
about these people who
featured for their contacts

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,550
go right to their website,
but without further ado,

138
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,070
we're gonna start talking
about how we went through this

139
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,050
and how we just picked the winners

140
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,690
and what were some of
the different dynamics

141
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,733
in separating these organizations apart.

142
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,445
- Oh no, this is all you.

143
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,690
- All me, okay
- This is all you.

144
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,850
- We've rehearsed this, this is great.

145
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,760
So when you think about
how do you measure impact,

146
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,890
if you've ever seen somebody

147
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,550
like Sounil Yu slice and
dice the Cyber Defense Matrix

148
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,770
in all the different ways you could,

149
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,520
he practices this in
almost everything he does.

150
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,609
And what we wanted to
do is really find a way

151
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,940
to kinda separate organizations

152
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,640
and talk about how they did.

153
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
So one way was demographics.

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,560
So demographics is a fancy
word for your population.

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,540
Is it kids?

156
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,760
Is it senior citizens?

157
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,593
Is it veterans?

158
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:15,580
Is it minorities?

159
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,990
So some cybersecurity non-profits

160
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,980
is focused on a certain demographic.

161
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,810
Others have a different medium.

162
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,110
Do they speak in classrooms?

163
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,950
Do they speak on the internet?

164
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,610
Are they doing PDS, public
awareness news shows?

165
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,100
Are they doing coloring books?

166
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,670
So the medium is a different
thing to consider as well.

167
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,780
Then finally, what are the numbers?

168
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,450
If somebody is gonna make a coloring book

169
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,930
and give it to one K-12 classroom,

170
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,570
that's not as impactful as maybe somebody

171
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,370
who's doing it across a thousand.

172
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,830
So we looked at all three
of those different things.

173
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,550
And this was a lot of the ways

174
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,640
that our board was able to kinda separate

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,883
and pick some of those winners.

176
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,180
And we were just excited that
we actually got different,

177
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,770
if you look at the distribution

178
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,340
of everybody who came in here,

179
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,450
we've got somebody in
almost every demographic.

180
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,170
We've got a lot of different mediums

181
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,060
it's not just all people
doing online YouTube videos

182
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,893
and things like that

183
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,320
so they're some pretty innovative things.

184
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,153
So let's get right to it.

185
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,240
- Very excited to announce.

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,710
- Alright, so introducing
the four runner ups,

187
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,979
I think I have the first one here.

188
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,350
So the first runner up that
we're going to be announcing

189
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,800
is the National Cybersecurity Center.

190
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,670
So the National Cybersecurity Center

191
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,790
is dedicated to raising
cybersecurity awareness

192
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,820
through education and
public policy innovation.

193
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,575
Their education programs are K-12 students

194
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,580
and adult learners with education

195
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,900
and certification opportunities

196
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,959
to address the cybersecurity
workforce and knowledge gaps.

197
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,570
Cyber for state leaders
raises cybersecurity awareness

198
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,289
and hygiene practices of state leaders

199
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,030
across the contract country.

200
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,630
With respect to policy,

201
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,930
NCC focuses on innovative
technologies in elections,

202
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,219
and emerging cyber
resource center for state

203
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,680
and local governments
to include a cyber range

204
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,550
and the first space ISACA

205
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,930
with leading space industry partners.

206
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,060
So you can see that's a
great example of a nonprofit

207
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,965
that touches a wide number of things.

208
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,840
In particular we were really impressed

209
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,300
with how they worked with state

210
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,502
and local government leaders.

211
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:11,803
- That's quite the need.

212
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,053
One In Tech is an ISACA
Foundation organization.

213
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,770
They work to build diversity,
inclusion, and equity

214
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,120
within the cybersecurity space
to ensure underrepresented

215
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,740
and underserved populations
can stay safe online

216
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,610
and enable strong pathways
to a data caring career.

217
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,300
I like how they incorporated
data care in there.

218
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,010
Our key focus is providing
educators support,

219
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,670
leadership experiences, events in advocacy

220
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,870
about both cyber safety and cyber careers

221
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,263
to children and adults.

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,590
Specifically women, girls
and people of color.

223
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,520
OIT utilizes a collaborative model

224
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,170
for maximum impact partnering
with communicating,

225
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,930
and communicating with organizations

226
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,390
such as the Chicago Public School system,

227
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,246
American Black Librarian
Association, Erie 1 BOCES,

228
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:09,730
Women4Cyber, AnitaB.org
and various companies

229
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,280
in nearly 200 ISACA
chapters around the world.

230
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Again, very broad capability
pulling in partners

231
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,709
that are all interested and needing

232
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,090
to drive forward the awareness.

233
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,390
- So this next third runner up

234
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,763
is not a traditional
cybersecurity nonprofit.

235
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,329
- Partners In Care from Maryland

236
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,540
is dedicated to helping older adults live

237
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,459
and thrive independently.

238
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,840
The culture of their
staff, sponsors, donors,

239
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,160
and volunteers of all
generations provide a network

240
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
to help keep senior
adults independent, safe,

241
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,539
healthy, and active community members.

242
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,819
They will launch a data
care for seniors, members,

243
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,930
volunteers, family members, and staff

244
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,969
on their new website designed
to provide information

245
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,620
and provide access to relevant

246
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,590
and free partners in care services.

247
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,960
Again, there's several of us

248
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,210
that know the senior population really

249
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,310
that the way you address
these different populations

250
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,030
is different, it's not one thing fits all.

251
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,699
So we're really happy

252
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,553
that there was a submission
specifically for seniors.

253
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,550
- And our last runner up is Theorem Media.

254
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,699
Theorem Media has a mission

255
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,170
to harness digital entertainment

256
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,890
to create a more educated, inclusive

257
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,400
and involved citizenry.

258
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,709
We work with world-class
directors, writers and producers

259
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,420
to create popular digital
short films, podcasts,

260
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,780
graphic novels with massive distribution

261
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,949
including K-12 and companion materials.

262
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,430
Theorem Media has established partnerships

263
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,959
with iconic culturally influential

264
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,310
international film festivals

265
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,800
and will establish further partnerships

266
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,949
with cybersecurity forms worldwide

267
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,350
to coordinate both festival

268
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,655
and command performance screenings.

269
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:01,170
This is a really cool non-profit.

270
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,849
They've also got, normally I don't call

271
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,740
out other people's advisory boards,

272
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,910
but two of our foundation folks
are on their advisory board,

273
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,260
both Dmitri Alperovitch and Tony Sager.

274
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,340
Now we have a process they
have to recuse themselves

275
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,150
but it's still kinda
cool that they're there.

276
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,209
Eli Sugarman, who helped us

277
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,240
kinda get our foundation he's there.

278
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,390
And also Jen Easterly,

279
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,730
she's probably a little busy right now

280
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,800
'cause she took over CISA

281
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,620
so that's quite a well-connected group.

282
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,580
So congratulations to all

283
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,410
of our four runners up right there.

284
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,260
- Right, and we've been crying

285
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,230
or collaborating trying to figure out

286
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,940
how do we do a PSA, a
public service announcement,

287
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,920
kinda like ''Smokey the
Bear'' or anything else

288
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,099
to help draw in.

289
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,510
And this to me is a really unique way

290
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,510
to draw in a more public
engagement in this industry.

291
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,730
- Excellent, well now
on to our third place,

292
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,940
second place, and first place grants.

293
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,090
Cindy is going to introduce
our third place grant.

294
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,170
- So the third place winner,

295
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,839
has for 25 years
significantly raised awareness

296
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,810
of the cryptologic communities.

297
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,449
This organization provides free
cyber's education resources

298
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,250
for K-20 cohorts and
stimulates conversations

299
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,700
regarding data care.

300
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,600
This organization will utilize the funding

301
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
to conduct focus groups aimed at reaching

302
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,780
beyond its current
relationships and to determine

303
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,319
and collect a storybook
content that resonates

304
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,260
and effectively communicates
this message to the masses,

305
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,230
especially those in
underrepresented groups.

306
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,170
It is crucial that credence
be given to the youth voices

307
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,319
to inspire the next generation
of cyber professionals.

308
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,380
And based on this, this organization

309
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,900
will exponentially increase
outreach and impact.

310
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,150
And the third place winner

311
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,980
is the National Cryptologic Foundation.

312
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,100
And today we have two representatives,

313
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,930
Laura Nelson, who is
the CEO and Mark Loepker

314
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,420
who is the Education Program
Director, so welcome.

315
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,569
- Thank you, well, good morning.

316
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,556
I'm Laura Nelson, the President and CEO

317
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,707
of the National Cryptologic Foundation.

318
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:14,070
And we would like to
thank the Gula Foundation

319
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,050
for this generous grant and opportunity

320
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,680
to explore and educate all individuals

321
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,380
about the importance of data care.

322
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,470
The recent hacking of
the Colonial Pipeline,

323
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,290
demonstrated the importance of data care,

324
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,620
not only from a corporate standpoint,

325
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,480
but from a national and
economic standpoint.

326
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,700
We recognize the U.S. is
being targeted more often now

327
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,510
than in the last 50 years.

328
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,150
50 years ago, we protected
the defense of our nation with

329
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,920
or through cryptology.

330
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,729
Now the lessons of cryptology

331
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,030
are being incorporated into cybersecurity,

332
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,600
the defense of our nation

333
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,883
and the defense of our own personal data.

334
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,030
For those of you not familiar

335
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,939
with the National Cryptologic Foundation,

336
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,200
we were incorporated 25 years ago

337
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,470
as a National Cryptologic
Museum Foundation.

338
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,160
We were originally incorporated
to support activities,

339
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
displays and artifact acquisition

340
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,240
for the National Cryptologic Museum,

341
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,650
but over the years our
mission has broadened

342
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,097
to include a robust education program

343
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:12,020
and a capital campaign to build

344
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,390
the Cyber Center for
Education and Innovation.

345
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,689
Our mission is to educate,
stimulate, commemorate.

346
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,910
To educate the public and
inspire our nation students

347
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,319
to explore cryptology, cyber
and stem fields of study.

348
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,010
To stimulate robust
dialogue and engagement

349
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,380
with the American public on cyber policy,

350
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,240
technology, privacy and data care.

351
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,150
And to commemorate all
those who serve in silence

352
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,860
in the cryptologic mission
with valor and distinction.

353
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,140
Our support of the National
Cryptologic Museum,

354
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,010
remains a vital part of our mission,

355
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,470
especially as we expand our partnership

356
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,423
with the National Security Agency.

357
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,589
The reason why we're
here and being recognized

358
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,420
by the Gula Foundation is due
to the steadfast leadership

359
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,329
of our Education Director, Mark Loepker.

360
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,830
Our education program includes,

361
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,060
one, the development and piloting

362
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,199
of High School Cybersecurity
Curriculum Guidelines

363
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,670
and use of the guidelines in
state departments of education

364
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,189
and school districts across the country.

365
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,430
The curriculum is available, at no charge,

366
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,260
to every U.S. high school
through our partner, Teach Cyber.

367
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,319
Second, hosting cybersecurity,

368
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,340
professional development
workshop for teachers.

369
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,690
Third, virtually bringing
cybersecurity education

370
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,450
into the classroom, even
before the pandemic started.

371
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,970
And finally, developing a
Data Care Concept booklet

372
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,870
for middle school students
and teachers that describes

373
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,433
how cyber touches every
aspect of our lives.

374
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,610
We've come to recognize

375
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,840
that introducing concepts of
data care and cybersecurity,

376
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,030
should and can be similar to
a team learning how to drive.

377
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,010
From a very young age
we teach our children

378
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,590
to stop at a stop sign or stoplight

379
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,590
and to drive at the speed limit.

380
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,720
It may be a concept that we
can duplicate for data care,

381
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,800
create the highway for
current and future students

382
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,180
to become a cybersecurity
literate generation.

383
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,619
And now Mark Loepker we'll explain

384
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,889
how we're gonna use this grant opportunity

385
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,089
to educate K-12 students.

386
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,834
- Thank you very much, Laura.

387
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,099
Developing that middle school booklet

388
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,119
with the data care theme led us to seek

389
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,319
this additional opportunity
from the Gula Foundation.

390
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,139
We discovered that we
needed a new language

391
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,810
to describe the personal
sense of responsibility

392
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,070
for how cyber touches
every aspect of our lives.

393
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,210
The cybersecurity message is very complex

394
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,680
and we need to change that language.

395
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,090
The middle school booklet
begins to shift that message

396
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,810
to the data care message.

397
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,090
In our partner start engineering,

398
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,409
this grant will allow us to
establish effective means

399
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,010
and channels to communicate
the data care message

400
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,240
to the masses.

401
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,403
Now, especially those in
underrepresented groups.

402
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,630
Now there's many ways to
tell the story, right,

403
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,120
and different communities hear and learn

404
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,270
by unique methods.

405
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,420
Using various techniques,
including focus groups,

406
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,780
we'll discover those
modalities and channels

407
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,970
that resonate with these groups.

408
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,050
From this research,

409
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,159
we will develop the messages leveraging

410
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,667
the work we've done already
with media vehicles calibrated

411
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,100
to those populations
identified so they can benefit

412
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,480
from this amplified awareness and interest

413
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,883
regarding data care
principles and behaviors.

414
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,210
Now our overarching
vision for this portfolio

415
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,210
of audience specific messages,
will portray data care

416
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,058
as a holistic enterprise
encompassing individual

417
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:59,129
and institutional responsibilities,

418
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,380
technology and behavioral approaches

419
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,770
to prevention and protection.

420
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,850
And most importantly,
the career opportunities

421
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,649
for the diverse populations

422
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,603
across the wide range
of roles and functions.

423
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:15,130
And we are extremely excited

424
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,170
about getting started on this project

425
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,930
and spreading the message of data care.

426
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,310
Thank you very much, Ron and Cindy,

427
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,514
we really appreciate it.

428
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:24,515
- Thank you.

429
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,593
- Thank you and congratulations.

430
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,669
Go back to sharing my
screen, awesome, awesome.

431
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,593
- Thanks guys, great job.

432
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,050
Very excited to see what you come up with,

433
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,681
and oops, oh, the cat's
out of the bag on this one.

434
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,360
- The cat's out of the
bag, sorry about that.

435
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,719
- Second winner.

436
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,440
- Technical glitch, so, all right

437
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,740
now I don't have to
pretend that it's a secret.

438
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,910
As the leading U.S. voice
in cyber crime victims,

439
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,210
Cybercrime Support Network
serves those affected

440
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,690
by cyber crime support during and after.

441
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,950
They connect victims to resources,

442
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,470
increase cyber crime reporting

443
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,130
and empower digital citizens
to defend against cyber crime.

444
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,290
CSN launched three new programs in 2021,

445
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,490
SecureTogether, senior
romance scam peer support.

446
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,580
That's kind of an interesting one

447
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,480
I wanna hear about that.

448
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,313
- No you don't.

449
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,890
- Al right, and partnership
to fight cyber crime

450
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,180
for the military and veteran community.

451
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,180
So with that, I'd like
to welcome Kristin Judge,

452
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,960
the CEO and President of
Cybercrime Support Network.

453
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,300
And again, apologies for
the lack of reveal there.

454
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,810
(Cyndi and Ron laughs)

455
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,760
- That's okay, we don't need a drum roll.

456
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,910
This is just so exciting,

457
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,110
thank you so much, Cindy, Ron

458
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,899
and to the Gula Tech Foundation Board

459
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,880
for recognizing the value of our work,

460
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,468
it means so much to us.

461
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:48,650
It's such an honor to
have your and support.

462
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,690
And I may be the CEO and founder of CSN,

463
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,860
but our success has everything
to do with our mission,

464
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,709
our partners, and a mission driven team

465
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,240
that we have working
every day to serve others.

466
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm so honored to work
with the people at CSN,

467
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,449
we really are an incredible team.

468
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,790
Our mission is very simple,

469
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,810
we want to serve individuals
and small businesses

470
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,860
that are impacted by cyber crime.

471
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,750
When we started CSN,

472
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,670
it was actually a group of
volunteers coming together

473
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,610
with the understanding that
no one was really giving

474
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,409
the victims one place to go to get help.

475
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,690
And there's places to report
and there's also organizations

476
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,040
that do great education and awareness,

477
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,159
but we were missing this one piece

478
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,530
and that's what we wanted to fill.

479
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,937
Where is the one place I could
go after my small business

480
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:39,360
or myself have been a
victim of cyber crime.

481
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,949
And our board of directors,
our advisory board

482
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,830
are made up of some of the
industry's finest leaders.

483
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,870
And we partner with government agencies

484
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,139
along with NGO's leading in
securing the cyber ecosystem.

485
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,280
When I told people I
wanted to take on the issue

486
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,210
of serving cyber crime victims,

487
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,710
most people thought I was a little crazy,

488
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,900
but I said, I'm not gonna do it alone,

489
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,550
and we're not doing it alone,

490
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,000
we have so many great partners.

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,230
Multiple countries around the
world have federal programs

492
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,020
with one national call center to go to

493
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,540
for reporting response and recovery,

494
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,149
so that's what we've been
working towards in the U.S.

495
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,800
for over five years.

496
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,570
And the Cyberspace Solarium Commission

497
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,840
is now recommending a national center

498
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
to the Biden, Harris administration.

499
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,070
So we feel like we've been
giving a voice to the victims

500
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,950
in congress and around the country.

501
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,069
But until we have one
national call center,

502
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:33,190
we've created FightCybercrime.org

503
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,610
as a one-stop shop for
people to get resources.

504
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,300
We also partnered with Google
to create ScamSpotter.org

505
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,149
to go in and see, am I
in the middle of a scam?

506
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,870
Is this true or not?

507
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,010
And people can help get information there

508
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,600
on three golden rules to spot a scam.

509
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,570
So at CSN we envision a society

510
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,879
where everyone has the
knowledge, the skills

511
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,070
and the resources needed to recognize

512
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,100
and then defend against cyber crime.

513
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,639
Because cyber crime is
going to continue to grow

514
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,960
and devastate people and
businesses and our economies

515
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,740
as long as it's profitable
for the criminals.

516
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,450
So that's why the idea
of data care resonates

517
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,300
so much with our team.

518
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,899
'Cause we find sometimes
that victims of cyber crime

519
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,010
don't even recognize that
a cyber crime occurred,

520
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,320
it's a technical thing to them,

521
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,659
it's an IT thing for them.

522
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,460
But data care can really
help people understand

523
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,610
what this is about and it's about me,

524
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,969
and I have data and I
should take care of it.

525
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,643
So to me, it was really a no brainer

526
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:35,000
to wanna connect with this great idea

527
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,033
of helping people
understand what's happening.

528
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,790
And it's gonna take us a long way

529
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,310
to getting the buy-in from
whole communities now.

530
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,550
So I'd like to change the conversation to,

531
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,820
when we're talking about cyber
crime on a national level,

532
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,810
and talk about the impact of cyber crime

533
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,840
as an economic crisis.

534
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,449
Very few people talk about it that way,

535
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,540
but if we estimate that over $200 billion

536
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,200
is stolen from small
businesses and individuals,

537
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,077
just like you and I every year,

538
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,340
that's money not being
spent on health care,

539
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,560
food to feed our families, our rent,

540
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,179
going shopping on main street, retirement.

541
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,720
So when you put it that way, lawmakers

542
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,620
and decision makers really
understand this issue better.

543
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,729
Again, it's not an it issue,
it's an economic issue,

544
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,461
it's a personal issue,
it's a mental health issue.

545
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,050
So CSN has launched and is in the process

546
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,990
of launching three impactful
national programs this year.

547
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,040
We're so excited and the partnership

548
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,100
with the Gula Foundation and this gift

549
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,149
is really gonna help us
amplify these programs.

550
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,550
So the first one is our
partnership to fight cyber crime

551
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,899
for the military and veteran community.

552
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,130
We're creating a national program

553
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,460
in partnership with Craig
Newmark Philanthropies,

554
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,360
and the Bob Woodruff Foundation

555
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,990
to ensure our service
members, and their families,

556
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,140
and caregivers have consistent
messaging about the threats.

557
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,860
And then they have the
resources to recognize,

558
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,479
respond, and recover from an incident.

559
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,700
We know that they're
disproportionately targeted,

560
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,230
and we wanna make sure they
have consistent messaging.

561
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,140
So we've got some beautiful
PSA's and we're partnering

562
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,300
with military service organizations

563
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,220
and veterans service organizations

564
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,000
to help amplify the
messaging, and so hopefully

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,170
it'll be something that
people recognize right away.

566
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,290
We're thankful to Craig
Newmark and Comcast

567
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,480
that gave us the seed
funding for that program,

568
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,160
and Comcast actually just
gave us airtime worth

569
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,380
about a half a million dollars

570
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,290
so our PSA's can run all
around the country in the fall.

571
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,760
So it really is a public
private partnership,

572
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,879
everyone's coming together.

573
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,270
Second, we just launched this last Monday,

574
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,350
our first facilitated Peer Support Program

575
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,909
for survivors of romance fraud.

576
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,315
We work in partnership with prosecutors

577
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,440
and other impactful organizations,

578
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,480
like the Department of
Justice, Elder Fraud Hotline

579
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,710
to identify participants who
could benefit from the group.

580
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,420
And the FINRA Foundation
has graciously provided us

581
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,530
the seed funding for this program,

582
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,910
and it brings people together.

583
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,430
We are providing ourselves education

584
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,950
during this hour long session on fraud

585
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,440
and best practices and then give an hour,

586
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,310
which is an incredible nonprofit,

587
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,149
provides licensed mental
health professionals

588
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,440
to help support the healing.

589
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,700
So that program, we hope to grow and grow

590
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,380
and have hundreds of groups

591
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,670
and help people through that very dramatic

592
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,670
and impactful issue of
trust and losing money,

593
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,890
but then also wondering who
can I trust on the internet.

594
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,010
And when your love life is attached to it,

595
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,930
it's really raw sometimes.

596
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,400
So our third program is SecureTogether

597
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,400
and Trend Micro gave us
the seed funding for this.

598
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,860
It includes a webinar series,

599
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,969
and we've already gotten
that up and running,

600
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,850
and then we're gonna actually
change the security posture,

601
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,889
and this is the part that
gets me really excited,

602
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,940
of people in the U.S.

603
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,000
We are going to work with
partners to create a website

604
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,710
where someone that's a
little more tech savvy,

605
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,800
can sit down with someone in their life

606
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,930
and help them actually add
two factor authentication

607
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,810
to their email and social media,

608
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,550
and actually add automatic
updates to their browser

609
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,409
and their apps and change their posture.

610
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,290
Not just tell them about it,
not just show them a video,

611
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,010
but sit down and do it and then check off

612
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,428
that, yes, I did this for them

613
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:25,880
and with them they're more secure

614
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,220
and then put in their zip code.

615
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,500
We're gonna do some competitions,

616
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,270
maybe between fraternities

617
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,820
or between even state governments,

618
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,929
private sector companies can volunteer

619
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,090
to have this be their day of volunteer.

620
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,679
Where they all go out and work
with three small businesses,

621
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,790
maybe in their community and just put in

622
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,252
some basic cybersecurity that we all know

623
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,909
is gonna make a difference.

624
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,620
And then we're gonna measure
it with a thermometer

625
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,642
on our website and show
the millions of people

626
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,860
that are now more secure
because of this program.

627
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,147
So we've had so many
people come to us and say,

628
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,879
''How can I volunteer?''

629
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,820
And so we've created this great program

630
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,399
that will launch in October

631
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,310
and people will be able to volunteer

632
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,320
and actually change the
security posture of people

633
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,179
that they work with and
that they care about.

634
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,530
So more to come on that in October.

635
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,790
So the gift we received
today will help us,

636
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,540
help millions more through these programs

637
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,139
and our team could not be more proud

638
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,650
to be included among these
incredible organizations

639
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,340
doing so much for the community

640
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,240
that we all are trying to serve.

641
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,790
So thank you again for
the opportunity to apply,

642
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,918
and partner with you, Cindy and Ron,

643
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,713
we're just so honored on behalf
of the entire team at CSN.

644
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,433
- Well, that's great.

645
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,140
Again, we're very excited

646
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,210
about the work that you're doing directly

647
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,520
to the people and the victims.

648
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,990
And sometimes this
industry blames the victim

649
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,580
whereas any of us can get attacked,

650
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,629
and so we really appreciate
the work you're doing there.

651
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,050
- Thank you.

652
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,250
- All right, and so now
for the first place winner.

653
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,820
So this organization is at a
very significant university.

654
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,389
It's committed to creating
a culture of cybersecurity

655
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,130
through a comprehensive
K-12 cybersecurity program.

656
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,000
At this organization,

657
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,360
the program provides physical card games

658
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,649
and digital education games

659
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,474
and classroom material at
no cost to K-12 classrooms.

660
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,720
These stem resources are
designed to compliment each other

661
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,570
or function independently.

662
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,812
They are easy to access at home
to engage the entire family,

663
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:36,250
creating a culture of cybersecurity

664
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,290
throughout the community.

665
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,680
And the winner of this grant is,

666
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,890
the Center for Infrastructure
Assurance and Security

667
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,989
at the University of Texas in San Antonio.

668
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:51,163
And here we have with us Larry-

669
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:53,067
- Sjelin.

670
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,633
- Sjelin, we did practice, but you know.

671
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,063
- Okay, thank you very much Ron and Cyndi,

672
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,310
we're static of winning first place.

673
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,310
And the competition, obviously,
as you've heard was stiff

674
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,913
so to win first place it's just
a great honor for the CIAS.

675
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,149
The CIAS has been around
for about 20 years

676
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,800
and the culture of cybersecurity program

677
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,430
is just one part of our efforts.

678
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,960
We've been out in the
community, as I said,

679
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,220
for the last 20 years trying

680
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,800
to improve cyber security today,

681
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,800
what can we do to help folks
become better cyber citizens,

682
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,083
secure their organizations.

683
00:30:42,764 --> 00:30:47,764
And it's different for many
centers in the academic area,

684
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,720
many come and go with a
grant, we've been around for,

685
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,580
like I said the 20 years and
we've been pretty successful.

686
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,510
We also, I can I say I guess,
have a competitions group

687
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,640
that is the technology behind
the CyberPatriot program

688
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,710
from AFA, the Air Force Association,

689
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,280
which is very successful.

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,399
And we also do

691
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,480
the National Collegiate
Cyber Defense Competition,

692
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,793
which is in its 16th year now.

693
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,870
We do training, we work a lot with FEMA

694
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,310
and CISA and DHS.

695
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,419
I am the director of the game program

696
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,014
and I think I have the
funnest part of the job

697
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:29,223
that's here at CIS.

698
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,520
We then started in 2016 this program

699
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,730
to reach students in K-12.

700
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,479
And we first targeted
the six through 12 grades

701
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:46,100
with our collectible card game called,

702
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,203
Cyber Threat Defender.

703
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,850
We wanted to develop something
that was truly a game

704
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,429
and it was fun for students to play.

705
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,730
And through this repetition
of playing the game

706
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,030
'cause they enjoyed it,

707
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,530
they would learn about cyber security.

708
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,420
We just didn't want something
that they would play once

709
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,720
and move on and never touch again,

710
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,121
we wanted something that
they would play in school,

711
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,570
maybe play it at home, play
with friends and family,

712
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,730
and really get them thinking

713
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,583
about cybersecurity is
part of everyone's life.

714
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,817
And so we have started that,

715
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:26,470
and we have over 50,000
decks distributed globally,

716
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,760
this was something that
we are very proud of,

717
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,163
where CTD is in 17
countries that we know of.

718
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,600
At least 500 schools for school districts

719
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,132
are using this tool daily
in their classrooms.

720
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,790
And one of the proudest
things is the Air Force,

721
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,200
the U.S. Air Force, that has adopted CTD

722
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,440
as part of their curriculum
at their technical schools

723
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,063
at the Shaw Air Force Base.

724
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,930
So it's proven itself time and again,

725
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,970
with a wide audience,
again, from sixth grade

726
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,233
on up to 12 and beyond.

727
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,780
This was only accomplished
through sponsorships

728
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,780
and gifts from the private
industry, individuals,

729
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,130
we know there is no dedicated
funding from the state

730
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,450
or the academic university
here for this program.

731
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,180
So it's really through folks out there

732
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,720
that are involved in
cybersecurity that wanna impact

733
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,720
and want that workforce coming
up to know cybersecurity

734
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,973
and what they need to do.

735
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,060
The demand was extremely great

736
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,800
from the elementary school teachers

737
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,500
for something similar to CTD,

738
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
but more on that the grade
levels, K through five,

739
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,340
so we developed two more games.

740
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,600
One was called Cyber Threat Protector,

741
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,959
which focuses on grades three through five

742
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,890
and then our Cyber Threat Guardian Game

743
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,383
which is K through two.

744
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:08,690
And obviously, you're not
gonna teach a kindergarten

745
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,759
about in-depth cybersecurity,
but it we need to start

746
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,100
as early as possible creating great

747
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,089
and good cyber citizens out there.

748
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,090
So this trilogy of games
builds upon each other,

749
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,179
they can go from grade to grade

750
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,712
with the same concept, the same tools

751
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:32,652
to help them understand cybersecurity.

752
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,260
We estimate that probably

753
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,260
we are reaching 250,000
students every school year,

754
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,100
so these cards that are in the schools,

755
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,895
it's just not one student that use them,

756
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:52,895
every year students are
being exposed to this tool.

757
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,780
So that number is growing rapidly.

758
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,880
And this gift literally

759
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,560
is going to help us double that number

760
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,900
and that outreach.

761
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,690
This is the single largest
gift that we've received

762
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,990
for this program and we
just couldn't be happier

763
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,830
that we can put this money
to use, like get these cards

764
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,513
into the hands of students and teachers.

765
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,780
The best praise for this
program comes from the teacher

766
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,560
and it's changed the way
they teach cybersecurity

767
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,573
in the classroom.

768
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:31,470
Like you can't get a better
recommendation from them,

769
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,620
from a teacher coming
to promote the program.

770
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,390
So again, we wanna thank
the foundation very much

771
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,053
for this gift and we'll
definitely put it to good use.

772
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
- Awesome, thank you very much.

773
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,180
Thank you very much, Larry,

774
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,720
that's really, really inspirational.

775
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,730
Everybody did a great job
talking about their non-profits,

776
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,670
I really appreciate everybody
kinda coming out today.

777
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,460
So just to wrap up, I wanna
thank again all the winners.

778
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,720
We just heard from the University
of Texas at San Antonio

779
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,299
with their CIAS program.

780
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,560
We heard from the
Cybercrime Support Network,

781
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,643
which came in second.

782
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,330
We heard our third place winner,

783
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,210
which was the National
Cryptologic Foundation.

784
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,740
And of course our four
runners up were One In Tech,

785
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,930
an ISACA Foundation, the
Partners In Care from Maryland,

786
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,038
the National Cybersecurity Center,

787
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:29,250
and of course, Theorem Media.

788
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,760
Now we're not announcing
another grant competition today,

789
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,110
I would say stay tuned, Cindy and I

790
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,280
we really wanna work
with the seven winners.

791
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,500
We wanna have them on our show.

792
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,220
We wanna make sure that if
there's anything we can do

793
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,113
as far as introductions
and follow through,

794
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:46,330
there's a good bit of work.

795
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,560
We're actually still working a lot

796
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,060
with the winners from the
first foundation grant award.

797
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,840
- And we've also realized

798
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,670
that the grant winners work together

799
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,420
to even amplify their own
messages and their own activities.

800
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,420
And that's just great to see
the organizations continue

801
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,980
to help each other through and navigate

802
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,710
and get more messaging out there.

803
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,310
And we just hope people
out there that have time,

804
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,995
have the ability will come
to our website, gula.tech,

805
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:23,759
and either look at the
previous grant winners

806
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,420
or the existing grant
winners and do what you can

807
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,100
to volunteer, to help, to get involved.

808
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,509
Because again, it's going
to make everybody more safe

809
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,730
and better in the future if we
get more people involved now.

810
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,530
- And also at the website, gula.tech,

811
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,540
we've got a section on data care.

812
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,360
It's not ours, it's not copy written,

813
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,670
take it, steal it we're
all in this industry

814
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,570
we live in a bubble.

815
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,010
As much as we're participating

816
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,760
in the largest and best
cybersecurity conference,

817
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,300
we are in a mere bubble of what the rest

818
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,020
of the world perceives
about cybersecurity.

819
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,360
They don't speak our language,

820
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,280
they don't know how to join our workforce,

821
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,580
they don't know how to protect themselves

822
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,120
and we really need to be better

823
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,960
as cyber citizens educating them.

824
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
And I think everybody here embodies that

825
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,440
and we hope to really to
continue to see through in that.

826
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,290
- And again, we can't
thank RSA Conference enough

827
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,500
to allow us to highlight these winners

828
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,850
and really highlight all the companies

829
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,490
out there doing great work

830
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,850
and working towards
being more cyber secure

831
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,170
into the future, so thank you.

832
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,540
- Thank you, and enjoy the
rest of the conference.

833
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,560
Congratulations to our winners,

834
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,710
keep up the great work.
