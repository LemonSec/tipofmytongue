1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,127
- Hello, and welcome to this RSA session,

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:06,130
"Hooked By the Phisherman:
Quarterbacking Breach Response

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,019
with Law Enforcement."

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,460
My name is Mark Sangster,
cybersecurity author

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,770
and industry security
strategist with eSentire,

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,740
and joining me today is a
distinguished panel of experts.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,740
I will let them quickly
introduce themselves

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,113
starting on my virtual left with Justin.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,942
- Good afternoon.

10
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:23,650
My name is Justin Daniels.

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,860
I'm an attorney at Baker Donelson.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,910
I help quarterback companies
creating cybersecurity hygiene

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,880
and also what we're going
to talk about today,

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,063
which is quarterbacking incident response.

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,022
- Good afternoon.

16
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:38,700
My name is Marc Debrody, and
I'm a Supervisory Special Agent

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,430
with the United States Secret Service

18
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,740
based here in our Atlanta office.

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,690
I oversee our Cyber Fraud Task Force,

20
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,599
which consists of members
from private industry,

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,420
law enforcement, and academia.

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm also privileged to
be able to supervise

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,990
a group of talented men and women

24
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,940
in our Digital Evidence and Forensics Lab

25
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,580
who respond to cyber related
crimes in the Atlanta area.

26
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,140
Looking forward to the
conversation and some of the Q&A.

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,183
- Hi everyone.

28
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:05,394
I'm Jodi Daniels, and my
company, Red Clover Advisors,

29
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:07,121
is a privacy consultancy,

30
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:11,259
so we help companies comply
with global privacy laws

31
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,400
like GDPR, CCPA, and the
myriad of other privacy laws,

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,160
and we serve as the
fractional privacy officer

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,929
to many small and mid-sized companies.

34
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,893
Glad to be here.

35
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,773
- Hello everyone.

36
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:23,606
I'm Catherine Lyle.

37
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,470
I am the Head of Claims at Coalition.

38
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,179
We are a cyber insurance carrier

39
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:32,240
that works with entities
like Baker Donelson,

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,731
with the U.S. Secret
Service, with Red Clover

41
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:39,173
to help entities recover
from cyber events.

42
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,260
- Terrific, and thanks
everyone for joining us today

43
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,430
and sharing your expertise
and your insights.

44
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,263
Just before we begin,

45
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:47,273
I would just like to remind
everyone who is attending

46
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,240
that you can enter any questions you have

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,199
in the chat window,

48
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,850
and we will make sure
that we do cover them

49
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,830
during the session.

50
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,499
And that also for those
of you seeking CLE credit,

51
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:58,467
the code will appear in the chat box

52
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,140
towards the end of the presentation.

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,190
So with that out of the
way, let's get started.

54
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,890
So I'm just going to set the
scenario for you that we face,

55
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,259
and this comes from kind of a combination

56
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,899
of real world events that
we've all had to work with.

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,100
So in this case, the phishing scam is

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,662
a student from a
prestigious business school

59
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,990
approaches a senior executive
looking for a mentor.

60
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,440
And of course, after several weeks,

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,204
the executive then receives
a document to a link

62
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:28,740
for a survey to effectively
make sure that the student

63
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,910
can get their academic credit completion

64
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,743
for their course course.

65
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,410
Of course, they click on the link,

66
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,450
their Office 365 login window
appears, and they log in.

67
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,850
It appears to conform with
the company's policies

68
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,200
and standards and branding.

69
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,390
And once logged in, they
complete what looks like

70
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,239
a legitimate survey.

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
Days later, however, the
company receives an alert

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,730
about suspicious activity on the network.

73
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,228
When employees come in to
work the following morning

74
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,935
and they turn on their computers,

75
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,180
they all see the following message

76
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,800
with the contact email address.

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,760
And effectively, it's a ransomware message

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,376
that now says that every system,

79
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:03,590
all the files and data
in their environment,

80
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,800
has been locked, could be destroyed,

81
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,773
and they have to pay the
equivalent of $5 million in Bitcoin

82
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,388
to receive the decryption key.

83
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:14,990
As you can imagine, this is a
pretty bad start to your day.

84
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,023
So Justin, when this
sort of thing happens,

85
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,523
where do we start?

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,196
- Well, usually we start

87
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,859
when I get the call on
a Saturday or Sunday

88
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,620
because of course, the threat actor

89
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,670
wants to wait for the weekend.

90
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,780
And so what goes through my
mind is a variety of things.

91
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,030
One, many times the company

92
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,990
doesn't even have an
incident response plan,

93
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,850
so it means I got to
put together the team.

94
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,280
It also means what am I
thinking about in terms of

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
what are we going to communicate
to customers and employees

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,990
who are going to show up on Monday

97
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,090
and expect service and it's not happening?

98
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,120
What do we do with potentially
having a ransom negotiation

99
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,170
because we don't know yet if
we can get our systems back?

100
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,390
Do we have good backups?

101
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,809
Have they already ex filtrated data?

102
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,540
And as part of that,

103
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,280
we're going to have to
do a forensic report.

104
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,490
And then of course last
but certainly not least,

105
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,790
we're going to have to
engage with law enforcement

106
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,737
and get them involved in the process,

107
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:09,980
and that's the topic we're
going to talk about today.

108
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,899
And the art of incident response
is how do you figure out

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,743
which one of these factors
is the most important

110
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,897
at any time during the incident response,

111
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:21,522
and it changes like the weather hourly.

112
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,316
- So Justin, is there an
anecdote you can share on,

113
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:28,190
I mean you deal with these
events on a regular basis.

114
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,860
Is there, you know, an
example of this kind of

115
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,890
ransomware attack that
you've had to handle?

116
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,979
- Oh, I've got several.

117
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,950
So I've dealt with three different ones

118
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,289
in the last four months,

119
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,070
one of which which is a
national logistics carrier,

120
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,969
and I got the call on a Sunday,

121
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,220
and their entire network was down,

122
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,150
and they're like, "What do we do?"

123
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,520
So I had to be like the Indy pit crew team

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,051
and put together the forensic
response, the PR crisis comms,

125
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,029
as well as dealing with law enforcement,

126
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,049
and that had to be done
within 24 to 48 hours.

127
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,989
And that includes putting
people under the proper

128
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,287
engagement letters to preserve
attorney client privilege.

129
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,270
There's just so many different things

130
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,210
that you're thinking about
in these different events

131
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,169
that you have to do right off the bat

132
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,920
before you can start working the problem.

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,950
And that's one of the reasons
why it's such a big deal

134
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,409
to have an incident response plan

135
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,420
'cause that first 24 hours without it,

136
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,950
I'm just putting together the team,

137
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,610
I'm not even working the problem yet.

138
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,750
And I've seen that happen again and again

139
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,103
because companies just don't have a plan.

140
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,100
- Yeah, and of course, one
of the issues that I think

141
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,350
things that we talked about
in preparation for this

142
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,940
was that you have to kind of gauge

143
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,360
the security acumen of
the firm, the executives,

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,717
and the people you're dealing with, right?

145
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,710
And what are some of
the challenges see there

146
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,450
with working with non-technical
leaders, as an example,

147
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,176
and trying to broker
communication and collaboration

148
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,810
between the sort of the
technical ones and zeros

149
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,110
and the dollar signs and
cents of the C-suite?

150
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,890
- I would say again, from my perspective,

151
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,070
I play the role of kind
of the interpreter.

152
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,998
I'm going to spend time later
this year taking a class

153
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,740
in network infrastructure

154
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,510
because it is so critically important

155
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,060
because the C-suite speaks one language,

156
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,900
the IT department speaks
a very different language,

157
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,799
and you put all of these
people under time pressure

158
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
with limited facts and expect them

159
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,090
to make good business decisions.

160
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,210
You can imagine how difficult that is,

161
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,960
especially if I've had cases where

162
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,280
the media is sniffing around

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,729
because the company has been big enough

164
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,440
and they've been in the
news for other reasons.

165
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,980
So you put all of those
ingredients into a bowl,

166
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,620
and you can imagine how
challenging that can be

167
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,320
and how important good communication is.

168
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,810
And you've got people who've
never worked together before,

169
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,170
who speak different business languages,

170
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,770
and you have to meld them together

171
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,960
and get the information you need

172
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,820
to make the best business decision,

173
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,563
which many times can be what
is the least bad decision.

174
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:55,272
- If I could add to what
Justin just mentioned

175
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:57,099
regarding the plan,

176
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,320
as far as the law enforcement piece there,

177
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
you know, we're not just reactive

178
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,599
in the law enforcement community,
we're proactive as well.

179
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,760
And we love to be a part
of those conversations

180
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,645
before, you know, the
proverbial hair's on fire

181
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:13,450
and you're responding to
the ransomware incident.

182
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,590
Some things we do, for
example, on the proactive side

183
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,984
are actually cyber education,

184
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,783
cyber hygiene for employees
and the C-suite as well.

185
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:24,160
We also are really excited
about participating

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,486
in tabletop exercises.

187
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,378
I've done several with Justin,

188
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,379
both at a large scale
with city municipalities

189
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,010
and even on a smaller scale
with the C-suite executives.

190
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,430
And it's really helpful
to kind of run through

191
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,310
that conversation in a calmer environment

192
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,300
where people can think
through the challenges

193
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,340
without having the pressure of, you know,

194
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,849
their computers being locked up.

195
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,341
So law enforcement would
love to get invited

196
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,042
to those conversations,

197
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,799
and we certainly wanna
establish those relationships

198
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,323
well before the crisis happens.

199
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,190
- And to that point, right,

200
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,640
knowing that you can reach
out to law enforcement,

201
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,330
to Marc and his team,

202
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,296
all comes from that preparation portion

203
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,239
that Justin was just talking about, right.

204
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:16,159
Making sure you have your
incident response plan

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,270
in place ahead of time

206
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,570
so that you all know how to communicate,

207
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,382
you know who to communicate with,

208
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,263
one of those entities
being law enforcement,

209
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:28,806
another entity being
your insurance company,

210
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,224
knowing that law enforcement

211
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:35,203
isn't going to rat you out, right.

212
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:40,203
Their interest is not to
go tell someone higher up,

213
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,193
their interest is to
help solve the problem.

214
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,660
And if you already are
comfortable with that

215
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,040
because you've already talked about it

216
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,750
with Justin and his team

217
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,060
because you know that, "Hey,
if we have a ransomware event,

218
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,536
we want to get them
involved ahead of time."

219
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:56,960
"Hey, if we have a ransomware event,

220
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,070
we're going to call insurance first,"

221
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,063
and also, "Hey, if we have an event,

222
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:04,680
we know what type of insurance we have."

223
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,723
These are all arising from
what Justin just talked about

224
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:11,920
because not all insurance
is created equal.

225
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,050
You need to know what
types of coverage exist.

226
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,959
You need to know where and
how they get implicated.

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,810
You need to know that, you know,

228
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,010
don't be defeatist about it.

229
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,620
Don't think, "Oh, well, it's
not going to be covered,

230
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,563
so I'm not going to do anything about it,"

231
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,096
because it may be covered,

232
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,360
or it may be only covered when you have

233
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,590
asked for authorization.

234
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,400
But those are all things
that you've talked about

235
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,299
during either your tabletop

236
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,237
because you've realized,
"Wait, we have insurance.

237
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:43,219
We would call our insurance company,"

238
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,433
or you have an incident response team.

239
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,950
- I'd like to echo the
tabletop part, Catherine,

240
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,970
that you just talked about.

241
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,180
I think it's so important for companies

242
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,089
to make sure that they
go through a simulation.

243
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,241
You know, sometimes maybe
this event happened,

244
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,880
and the team you thought
would be available,

245
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,860
maybe one of them is on
vacation or unavailable.

246
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,070
So who's going to be the
pecking order of, you know,

247
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,170
next in line?

248
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,010
And then it might seem like a simple idea,

249
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,933
but do print the actual contact list

250
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:15,287
because if it's on that network

251
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,820
and then you can't actually
get to the network,

252
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,120
it's going to be very challenging

253
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,233
to try and remember who everyone was.

254
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,540
- Absolutely, and where
the information is kept.

255
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,372
Right?

256
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,760
So to Jodi's point,

257
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,819
or Jodi, with the work that you do,

258
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:35,990
what systems we have, what
types of information we keep,

259
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,220
all of those types of things,

260
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,990
so that if it's there, it's printed out,

261
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,499
you've run through those things,

262
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,949
you know, "Oh on that server,
we don't keep employee data.

263
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:48,560
However, we also do keep
the keys to the kingdom."

264
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,530
So you just need to be able

265
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,683
to have hashed that out ahead of time.

266
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,500
- Catherine, I appreciate
you saying law enforcement

267
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,470
won't rat folks out.

268
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,010
Thank you.

269
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,650
I did not pay her to say
that, but it's very true.

270
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,510
And it's one of the obstacles actually

271
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,611
as to why people don't call us.

272
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,077
I have people say all the time,

273
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:10,080
"Well, we're afraid you're
going to go public with it,"

274
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,480
or, you know, "You're
going to report to OFAC,"

275
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,160
or you're going to, you know,
and none of that is true,

276
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,310
and we won't do those things

277
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,859
certainly without consulting
with you, with the victim.

278
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,730
We're not there to revictimize the victim.

279
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,628
We're the government,
we're here to help, right.

280
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:27,874
But we're focused on
attribution and disruption.

281
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:30,870
That's kind of law
enforcement's main role, right?

282
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,601
So we're not there to repunish.

283
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,000
And a couple of other points

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,660
I want to just kind of highlight

285
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,377
since we're on the subject is that,

286
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,270
you know, we have a tremendous
amount of experience

287
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,346
with multiple, various of ransomware.

288
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,530
And because of that experience,

289
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,659
we're able to really identify

290
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,931
kind of the trends and ways
these different variants,

291
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:55,214
not only, you know, the
vector into the network,

292
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,360
but how they propagate across the network

293
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
and how they may escalate
privileges and that type of thing.

294
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,740
So that's helpful when companies
are trying to determine

295
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,485
at the initial set of what
the severity and risk is

296
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:07,600
at the time.

297
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,113
And so we can provide some
of those background pieces,

298
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,430
indicators of compromise, perhaps.

299
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,500
In rare occasions,

300
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,880
we're also able to provide decryptor keys,

301
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,800
but that's more of the
exception than the rule.

302
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,170
And so, you know, inviting us in,

303
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,680
you know, we're just a piece of that team

304
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,997
that may be able to actually help you.

305
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,229
And if you're talking about
a business email compromise,

306
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,110
which I know it's not
the focus right here,

307
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,900
but that involves money in a real sense,

308
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,120
and if money is gone,
we certainly can help

309
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,870
with tracing that and bringing that back,

310
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,300
and we've actually helped

311
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,699
some of Justin's clients with that.

312
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,820
So call us, invite us in,
and we're here to help.

313
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,800
- But to your point on FTF, you know,

314
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,199
the funds transfer fraud
that arises from a BEC,

315
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,130
law enforcement's fantastic

316
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,933
because you're able to go and knock on

317
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,837
the virtual door of the bank and say,

318
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:02,000
"Hey, we're going to freeze this account.

319
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,741
We're going to either seize the money,"

320
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,098
which I know people associate
seizure as being bad.

321
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,301
Seizure is good with FTF,

322
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,530
with funds transfer fraud,

323
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,036
because that means it's being held by

324
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:15,080
the safety of the government.

325
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,630
And we've had cases where
working with law enforcement,

326
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,710
they say, "Hey, just file the paperwork.

327
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,030
We're going to return the money to you."

328
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,520
And it's worked.

329
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,025
And we've reached out many
times to the FBI, Secret Service

330
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:31,488
to get that assistance
to get those larger sums

331
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,480
and save those money.

332
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,940
You know, save that money and return it

333
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,880
'cause we don't want to fund,

334
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,906
we don't want to further fund
this kind of criminal action.

335
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,558
- And we will take those calls

336
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:44,054
that Catherine mentioned anytime,

337
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:47,086
but ideally we'd like those
calls if they're involving,

338
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:49,330
you know, transfers of funds,

339
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,810
to be within 72 hours.

340
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,021
And that's kind of a rule,

341
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,300
especially when it goes overseas.

342
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,192
A lot of these things make multiple hops

343
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,809
once the fraud happens.

344
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,666
So when they go overseas,
we have to initiate

345
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,260
what we call a kill chain letter request,

346
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,080
and that it has a 72 hour requirement,

347
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,010
and after that, it's very difficult.

348
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,970
So early is better in notifying,

349
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,175
and the earlier you notify
us in those situations,

350
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:15,410
the higher the probability
that we'll be able to actually

351
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,969
be successful in recovering some funds.

352
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,400
- It's funny you say that, Marc,

353
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,376
because I had a client
subject to wire fraud,

354
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:26,199
and they called me about 20
minutes after it happened,

355
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,053
and I was on the phone with
the Secret Service within five,

356
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,192
and we got almost all our money back

357
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,330
because as I like to say,

358
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,250
when the Secret Service calls the bank,

359
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,440
they don't get put on hold.

360
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,740
They don't have to dial six three times.

361
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,420
They just get put right through,

362
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,130
and that's one of the real advantages

363
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,470
of dealing with law enforcement.

364
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,240
But I want to add one other thing is

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,270
in a couple of the events that I handled,

366
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,460
I had a specific strain of ransomware,

367
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,430
and I was able to talk to law enforcement,

368
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,444
and they were able to
help us quickly identify

369
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,160
what were the indicators of compromise

370
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,069
so we knew very quickly
what we were dealing with

371
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,860
because as Marc said, law enforcement,

372
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,840
I mean, we were case number 67

373
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,890
according to the law enforcement agent,

374
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,995
and he had their whole repertoire.

375
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,210
And it was so helpful to have that

376
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,770
because it helped put us
in the right frame set,

377
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,241
and we knew exactly where to go

378
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,010
and what we were dealing with.

379
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,843
Why?

380
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,189
Because we reached out to
law enforcement upfront.

381
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,110
We weren't afraid.

382
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,370
I knew exactly what they
could do and not do.

383
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,255
And to echo Marc Debrody,
I work with them often,

384
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,130
and I've had nothing but
really good experiences

385
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,220
with professionals who, as Marc said,

386
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,185
they just want to figure out
who did it, have attribution,

387
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:40,021
and try to help you navigate all of that.

388
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:42,535
- And part of that is
the mitigation, right?

389
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,070
So Mark, we've talked
about like this mitigation,

390
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:48,150
but also OFAC has been pretty clear

391
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,620
that if you work with law enforcement

392
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,740
during the course of your ransomware,

393
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,338
you'll get that extra value, right,

394
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,500
that you'll be seen as cooperating.

395
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,887
So if you end up, you
know, down the pike, right,

396
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:04,925
we've seen all these new
variants that I think are

397
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,910
going to be in the eye of the government

398
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,319
and possibly hitting OFAC,

399
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,210
maybe they'll look kindly upon you

400
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,020
that you involved law enforcement.

401
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,800
And they've said so much
in some of their alerts.

402
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,410
- Catherine, can we just
level set for a minute there?

403
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,480
'Cause I know we were
going to talk about it

404
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,650
in greater detail in a little bit,

405
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,093
but you just tell us about Treasury's,

406
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,290
the two bulletins or
alerts that they put out

407
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,430
towards the end of last year,

408
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,939
and what they mean and
what you're referring to

409
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,020
when you talk about the OFAC list.

410
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,853
I know most people do,

411
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,569
but just to make sure
everyone understands.

412
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,230
- Sure, and everybody else, you know,

413
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,550
chime in where I have gaps.

414
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,436
So Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC,

415
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:44,980
it is, you know, the naughty list.

416
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,550
It is the sanction list.

417
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,851
It is the list that the U.S.
Government Treasury keeps

418
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:54,851
and says that you cannot pay
any individual, any company,

419
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,819
any country on this list

420
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,820
because they are, you
know, deemed the bad guys.

421
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,940
That list though has strict liability.

422
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,770
So if you pay someone
that is not on the list

423
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,520
and they are later put on the list,

424
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,570
Treasury can come back
and say you're liable,

425
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,639
even though at the time
they were not on the list.

426
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,653
Now this includes, right,

427
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:26,930
any entity working that's associated,

428
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,230
with let's use Iran with Russia right now.

429
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,360
These are sanctioned, right?

430
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,360
These are on the sanction
list, so we can not pay them.

431
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,902
If in the future, as we
have seen in the news,

432
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,920
we've had ransomware
very much in the news.

433
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,360
If in the future, we find that
variants end up on that list,

434
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,530
we will not be able to pay for a variant.

435
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,340
But if on the day that we pay,

436
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,030
they're not on the list, right,

437
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,956
by working with law enforcement

438
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:01,010
and showing OFAC in the future

439
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,877
if they were to come back and say,

440
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,633
"Hey, you paid," there's protection there.

441
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,397
- And Justin, when Catherine
talks about liability here,

442
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:13,240
are we talking about regulatory
fines and settlements,

443
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,200
or are we talking about criminal
prosecution potentially?

444
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,670
- Oh, no, Lieutenant Kaffee.

445
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,540
We have behind door number one for you,

446
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,570
criminal prosecution for money laundering.

447
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,090
What I would add is,
and I love this language

448
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,149
that's in the OFAC ruling,

449
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,530
if you work with law enforcement,

450
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,240
it is a substantial mitigating effect.

451
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,290
Exactly what that means, I don't know,

452
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,700
but it basically codifies
that if you're involved

453
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,180
in a ransomware engagement,

454
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,760
you best be picking up the phone

455
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,620
to engage with law enforcement

456
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,080
because if any of the other things

457
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,300
that Catherine is talking
about were to happen,

458
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,307
you want to be able to say,

459
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,220
"Yes, I did engage with law enforcement.

460
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,850
We worked with them from the outset."

461
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,879
Because the government
wants to incentivize

462
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,689
this cooperation and collaboration

463
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,540
because as we'll probably
talk about later,

464
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,670
is in light of just this year
with ransomware and last year,

465
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,130
we have to really overhaul
how we are working together

466
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,255
as the private sector, public
sector, and law enforcement

467
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:12,010
on how we deal with
this stuff proactively.

468
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,810
And I think that OFAC advisory was part of

469
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,030
that underlying policy.

470
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,061
- If I could just add to Justin
and Catherine's comments,

471
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,010
I want to clarify the Secret Service

472
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,310
and federal law enforcement as a whole,

473
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,060
we're not regulators, right.

474
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,047
Just want to emphasize that point.

475
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,660
And in fact, we're not even
notifying regulators or OFAC

476
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,180
unless the victim actually
requests that we do so.

477
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,380
And of course, we would report

478
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,827
that it's timely and cooperating

479
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,470
if in fact that happened.

480
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,850
I mean, a simple phone call saying

481
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,429
that we have a ransomware and hanging up

482
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,003
is not kind of full timely.

483
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:49,050
Somebody DMD me,

484
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,399
gosh, I sound like my 12
year old when I said that,

485
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,233
but I apologize.

486
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,280
Somebody DM me and said, "Who do we call?"

487
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,177
You know, they were asking,

488
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,101
"Do we call Secret Service, FBI, IC3?"

489
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,845
So that's a very good question,

490
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,954
and the answer is call someone,

491
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:06,954
and call someone that you
have a relationship with.

492
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,155
We're going to throw up
on the screen eventually,

493
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,626
Mark Sangster will do that,

494
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,120
showing our website
with the Secret Service

495
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,789
where we have the list of
the 40 plus task forces

496
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,740
across the country and actually globally

497
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,710
and the phone number and the
contacts of those locations

498
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,530
so you can actually reach
out, again, proactively

499
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,441
and have a conversation
before the crisis happens

500
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,626
and you can connect with someone.

501
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:35,500
FBI, Secret Service, we're all...

502
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,728
I mean, there's plenty
of crime to go around.

503
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:39,330
I work tremendously well,

504
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,659
we all work tremendously well

505
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,894
with our federal partners
here in Atlanta and elsewhere.

506
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,229
And don't worry about, you
know, is this FBI jurisdiction

507
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,770
or Secret Service?

508
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,740
We will de-conflict
that in the background.

509
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,744
So if you happen to call the wrong agency,

510
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:55,689
it may be FBI or Secret Service,

511
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,237
We'll de-conflict that,

512
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,530
so you don't have to worry about that.

513
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,730
And we just want to make certain that

514
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,120
the most important thing
is that you make the call.

515
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,466
So thanks for that question.

516
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,870
- But that goes back to
the preparation, right?

517
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,429
'Cause call Coalition, call
your insurance carrier,

518
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,320
call Justin, right?

519
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,087
Say, "Hey, do you have a contact here?"

520
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,230
"Yes, let me put you in touch with them."

521
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,877
Let's use all the
services that you can have

522
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:23,800
at your beck and call.

523
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,616
Go do the tabletop.

524
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,875
You know, all of that is so essential.

525
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,547
It's just as essential as
knowing where your data is.

526
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,143
It's just as essential as
all those other elements.

527
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,250
- And part of building
that relationship is

528
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,510
you'll have the ability
to hear a little bit about

529
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,510
the types of ransomware that's out there.

530
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,240
What are some of the risks
that you should be mindful of

531
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,380
and understand?

532
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,160
So Marc, to your point
where I can't just call you

533
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,080
and hang up.

534
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,913
I did my job.

535
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:53,080
I called you.

536
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,646
I really need to be able
to build a relationship

537
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,040
and involve you.

538
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,050
And so, as part of that preparation,

539
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,365
it's really having the opportunity to

540
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:05,637
have them come to the company,
participate in the tabletop,

541
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:07,780
and hear what's kind of on the street,

542
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,410
what do I need to be mindful of,

543
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,840
what's happening with other companies.

544
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,659
And to Justin, your point
about the collaboration

545
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,210
between public and private,

546
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,509
the more companies that
engage law enforcement,

547
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,725
the better off all companies will be

548
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,812
because we're all then going
to have more information

549
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:28,427
to be able to protect and
hopefully continue to try and win.

550
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,610
- So Marc, when we're
talking about communication,

551
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,476
what about in the preparation side?

552
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,910
So you talked about, you
know, tabletops and, you know

553
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,370
executive awareness training,

554
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,129
but are those aspects that you would

555
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,140
help a company with as well
when it comes to, you know,

556
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,188
internal communication,
client communication,

557
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:50,710
and so on to any affected parties?

558
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,161
- Yeah, we certainly, we do a
lot of education to employees

559
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,780
across, you know...

560
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,850
Pre COVID, we were doing it in person.

561
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,608
We do it across our task
forces, across the country.

562
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,260
We're doing a lot of virtual stuff.

563
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,614
We do targeted presentations
towards C-suite executives

564
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:08,770
that focus on business
email compromise ransomware.

565
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,607
But you know, one of
the questions we get is,

566
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,920
you know, "If we do call you,
what do we need to provide?"

567
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,037
Like, "What are you going to ask of us?"

568
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:19,020
"Are you going to ask for
the entire kitchen sink,

569
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,254
you know, or what are you asking for?"

570
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:24,719
And so what I often say to folks is

571
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,906
hopefully you've had that
conversation internally

572
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,360
before we do call.

573
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,159
You know, ask the questions.

574
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,740
What can we provide?

575
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,350
You know, the insurance,

576
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,850
whoever's in the mix here.

577
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,830
In law enforcement case,

578
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,340
you want to be able to
answer that question

579
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,949
with your legal counsel and everybody else

580
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,290
before it happens.

581
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,317
When we do call, we're going
to be asking for things like

582
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,428
network logs or IP addresses.

583
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:50,672
If it's a business email
compromise, email headers.

584
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,680
Did you download the malware?

585
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,663
Can we get a copy or samples?

586
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,550
Did you pay the ransom?

587
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,220
I mean, it's not
something that we endorse,

588
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,280
but we know it's a business decision.

589
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,158
If you do, can we get
information from the wallet

590
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:09,556
because there's certainly a
follow the money kind of angle

591
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,210
to this as well.

592
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,720
So those are some of the things, you know,

593
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,611
we're looking for,
indicators of compromise.

594
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:16,343
when we do respond.

595
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,720
- I mean, I would add
to what Marc is saying

596
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,080
about the relationship
with law enforcement

597
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,761
is I brought Marc into a tabletop
I did for a municipality,

598
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,184
and I hadn't done one for
a public entity before.

599
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,540
And when we did it,

600
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,240
one of the key things we took away is

601
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,125
when a private company decides
to make a ransom payment,

602
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,150
they get to do that in the
privacy of a boardroom.

603
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,170
For municipalities, they might have to

604
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,500
have a city council meeting,

605
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,200
which can be streamed,

606
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
and the threat actor can be listening,

607
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,409
and then it's like, "Oh,
you guys are agreeing.

608
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,440
You're going to pay a million dollars.

609
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,180
That's very good information to know."

610
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,680
And so one of the key takeaways

611
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,610
from that particular tabletop was

612
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,240
do we have a budgetary line item

613
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,900
that already has that included,

614
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,370
of course not called ransomware payment,

615
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,550
or are there special powers
that are in the city's charter

616
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,090
that we have to research and review

617
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,590
so that if we are in that situation,

618
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,860
we can then engage those special powers

619
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,540
to go behind closed doors or
otherwise not do it in public.

620
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,050
But part of the real value
of that whole exercise

621
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,778
is now the municipality knows exactly

622
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:24,370
the types of information
the Secret Service

623
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,300
or law enforcement would ask,

624
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,320
and so we know going
into it and we save time

625
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,723
and we know exactly what to give them.

626
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:33,409
Because what people don't realize

627
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,190
until you're in a ransomware event,

628
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,220
the most important thing is
how do you spend your time,

629
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,700
and the more that you know
upfront what to expect,

630
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,600
the more efficient and effective
you can be with your time.

631
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,531
- But to that point of time, right,

632
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:49,710
Marc was just talking about
oh, are you going to ask me

633
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,880
for all of this information.

634
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,323
A lot of information
they're already asking for

635
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:56,438
is part of information
that you would need to know

636
00:25:56,438 --> 00:26:00,200
because you have a series of
privacy obligations to meet.

637
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,940
And Jodi knows this all too well,

638
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,050
like, knowing where
your data is, et cetera.

639
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,310
So, you know, knowing that information,

640
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,139
you're not being tasked
of anything different,

641
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,130
right, Jodi?

642
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,400
This is something you should
be knowing ahead of time.

643
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,280
- Absolutely.

644
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,629
The data inventory as I like to say

645
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,751
is the foundation of a privacy program.

646
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:20,083
Thank you for the drum roll, Justin.

647
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,200
It's critical to be able to understand

648
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,222
what data elements you
have, where are they,

649
00:26:26,222 --> 00:26:30,450
are they on your databases,
are they on servers,

650
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,300
are they in vendors, third-party vendors,

651
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,149
what states are they in,
what customers are involved,

652
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,070
are they employees,

653
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,370
you really need to be able to break down

654
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,654
to that granular level
where all that data is.

655
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:47,320
And you know as Justin,
you always like to say,

656
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,409
if you have a ransomware event,

657
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,680
you need to be able to understand,

658
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,040
oh, that data on that
server, it's encrypted.

659
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,930
You might not be able to go check it out,

660
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,460
but if you had a data inventory,

661
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,670
you'd be able to understand,

662
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,080
oh right, well that one,

663
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,699
that includes the corporate information,

664
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
but this one over here is
the employee information,

665
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,410
and that one over there
is the most sensitive

666
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,890
customer information.

667
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,710
So you'd be better armed.

668
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,410
And then with that, it's
also going to help you

669
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,840
understand what your
data breach obligations

670
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,470
may or may not be,

671
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,914
as well as any other
privacy law obligations.

672
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:22,914
So each state has their
own data breach law,

673
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,971
as well as if you are an
international company,

674
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:28,500
you have international laws to consider.

675
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,880
And then depending on
the industry you're in,

676
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,018
you might also have industry specific

677
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,210
data breach obligations.

678
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,757
So best to start

679
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,370
once you have your incident response,

680
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,629
which is the starting point,

681
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,791
then you need the data inventory.

682
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,960
And from there, you can start to begin

683
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,410
some of your other obligations

684
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,563
that you and Justin would proceed with.

685
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,650
- It's funny you mentioned that

686
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,814
because from my perspective,

687
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,960
and I can't emphasize this point enough,

688
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,928
is the most important point
in any ransomware engagement

689
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:05,550
is when you might have a legal obligation

690
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,340
or otherwise need to start
discussing the ransomware event

691
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,495
with other people, and
it could be publicly,

692
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:13,492
it could be with your customers,

693
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,039
or if you've gotten the exfiltration

694
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,946
or access to personal information

695
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:23,946
that triggers notification
under the state laws,

696
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,700
that's when your rogue's
gallery of plaintiffs

697
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,020
can get very large.

698
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,970
And that's when you, at that point,

699
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,797
likely have some pretty
significant litigation

700
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,591
and legal liability risk
with the engagement.

701
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,697
And it's made much more difficult

702
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:41,080
if you don't even know what data you have

703
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,120
because once I get in
and it's all encrypted,

704
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,050
to Jodi's point,

705
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,040
if you don't have a good data inventory,

706
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,530
then we're guessing where it is

707
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,850
and multiply that problem even worse

708
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,569
because with remote workforce,

709
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:55,540
I've had multiple instances of
seeing on a ransomware event

710
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,980
where people downloaded
sensitive company data

711
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,510
or personal information to
their personal computer,

712
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,653
and that makes it an
even trickier problem.

713
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,848
- Yeah, of course.

714
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:11,779
BYOD is now BYOA, try
bring your office home.

715
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:15,270
Actually, we just had a question
come in around this point,

716
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,240
which is, "If you're in a scenario

717
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,080
where a third-party company, so a vendor,

718
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,860
has been compromised with ransomware

719
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,914
and there is a material impact,

720
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:25,470
what as their client should we be doing

721
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,738
to require that they disclose
this to us as the customer

722
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:31,618
and," sort of the second
part of that is, you know,

723
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:34,794
"Could they actually pay
or report to a regulator

724
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:38,197
and never notify us as the client?"

725
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,238
- So I handled that exact
situation a couple of months ago.

726
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:45,840
So I represented a medical IT company

727
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,050
and their hosting vendor got hit.

728
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,080
And the result of the
hosting vendor getting hit

729
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,080
with ransomware was our
customer's data was implicated.

730
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,220
And they ended up paying the ransom,

731
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,440
but the challenge that we had was

732
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,950
that company was not
forthcoming with information.

733
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,747
So we had a situation
that impacted our customer

734
00:30:06,747 --> 00:30:09,538
where we didn't really
know what was going on

735
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:12,179
because the vendor was hunkering down.

736
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,210
And I didn't have anything
in my contract with them

737
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,610
that required that if
they had a data breach,

738
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,120
that they had to disclose and cooperate.

739
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,497
To make my situation
even more difficult was

740
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:27,140
my client's liability
to our customer was 10X

741
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,000
what it was to the vendor because they had

742
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,640
a blanket $25,000 limitation
of liability clause.

743
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,380
So to me, the answer there
is you really need to care

744
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,790
what is in your contract

745
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,613
because it will likely be
your contract that governs

746
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:43,949
what is the vendor
required to disclose to you

747
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:45,502
if they have a data breach.

748
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:48,399
And then on top of that,
you need to make sure

749
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,641
that their liability is at least equal to

750
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,760
what your potential
liability is to your customer

751
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,900
because we provide so many
integrated services these days

752
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,910
where we are relying
on third-party vendors

753
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,260
to be part of our service.

754
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,140
And the unintended consequence of that

755
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,620
is the situation that the
attendee's question presented,

756
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,050
and that's exactly what I dealt with.

757
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,120
- It's because the client
is responsible, right?

758
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,418
They own that data.

759
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:16,659
So ultimately they're the ones

760
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,070
that are going to be held responsible.

761
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,439
And the vendor, you know,

762
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,361
you may try to third-party
suit them later,

763
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:27,361
but if they have 70, 100,
1,000 other third-party,

764
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:30,460
you know, claims coming in,

765
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,660
the likelihood of there
being enough money for them,

766
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,630
very limited.

767
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,470
- And what makes that situation
even more interesting,

768
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,620
because we're talking about healthcare,

769
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,810
so we're talking HIPAA,

770
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,899
is even though my client isn't going to be

771
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,260
the focus of the investigation

772
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,700
'cause we didn't have the breach,

773
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,232
if our customer who owns
the data has to notify,

774
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:49,530
now we bring into the class
action, to Catherine's point,

775
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,670
that's where my client
gets third partied in.

776
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,470
And they're like, "Well,
it wasn't our problem.

777
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,400
It was this vendor."

778
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,620
And I'm like, "But our contract with them

779
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,864
limits our liability in
a way that our liability

780
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:01,100
is not limited to our customer."

781
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,817
And I think our customers
looking at us and say,

782
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:05,220
"Hey, I don't care that
your vendor had a problem.

783
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,900
You're the person I contracted with.

784
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,420
And you're the one I
expect to be responsible."

785
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,285
- In practicality, we're seeing
this kind of manifest itself

786
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,298
in the field in cases in our area

787
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:19,330
where we have third-parties,
MSSPs, for example,

788
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,300
that are actually the primary
targets of the ransomware,

789
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,290
and it's disseminated
across their client base.

790
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,930
And we've had situations here

791
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,490
where we've had doctors offices,

792
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,650
small, medium-sized businesses

793
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,870
come in one Monday morning,

794
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,729
turn on their computers
and bam, they're frozen.

795
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,224
But they have no desire,

796
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,929
the bad actors have actually
no desire to negotiate

797
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,100
with the individual client.

798
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,699
They want to go through the MSSP

799
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,130
or whoever the third party is.

800
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,874
So it's very real,

801
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:48,410
and it's a disturbing trend actually.

802
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,243
- Well, as we've seen,

803
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:51,649
they'll also go to that third party though

804
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,034
and tell them, "Hey,
this is the threat actor.

805
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:57,390
Want to let you know, your
MSP has been held ransom.

806
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,223
They're not paying,

807
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:00,260
you might want to encourage them to pay."

808
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,003
So it's even gotten worse.

809
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:05,380
- Right.

810
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:07,980
- So here's a wildcard question
around payment of ransom.

811
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,550
What happens if that company
is an international company,

812
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,610
so outside of the US as an example,

813
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,747
or they pay the ransom
from another country?

814
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:18,840
So, you know, in terms of insurance, OFAC,

815
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,043
law enforcement, liability?

816
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,439
Maybe Justin, we could start with you

817
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,713
and everybody can give their opinion.

818
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,860
- That's an interesting question

819
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,649
because once we're going
across international

820
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:32,985
to different countries,

821
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:37,429
I think we're into how the
Secret Service might liaison

822
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:42,429
with Interpol and other
international law enforcement.

823
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,350
And then the other issue will become

824
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,360
what other laws in that
country might be implicated

825
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,344
because as Jodi alluded to,

826
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:52,470
Europe views privacy and
security very differently.

827
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,420
GDPR is the most
restrictive law in the world

828
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,770
regarding privacy, and you
have to notify within 72 hours.

829
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,490
So paying that ransom there are

830
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,460
a variety of different implications

831
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,021
because you're fine can be
up to, what is it, Jodi,

832
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:12,480
4% of global revenue.

833
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,830
So that's not cheap if you're
a pretty sizable company.

834
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,370
So as I look at that particular situation,

835
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,759
when you start going international,

836
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,929
you have to unpack a variety
of law enforcement issues

837
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,730
internationally, as
well as navigating GDPR

838
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,460
and laws like in Germany, for example,

839
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,130
they have very restrictive laws
around privacy and security

840
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,550
because European history
and how they view privacy

841
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,159
culturally is very different
than the United States.

842
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,152
And we sometimes don't appreciate that

843
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:42,909
unless you are over there doing business

844
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,310
and understanding how they view the world.

845
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,960
It's just very different than us.

846
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,563
- Just to clarify, the Secret Service,

847
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,125
we're not going to provide
sanctions related guidance

848
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,360
to victims.

849
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,770
That's going to be
something that the victims

850
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,920
do need to go directly to OFAC for

851
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,730
and to discover whether
or not there's that nexus.

852
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,236
We're not going to be
making that bridge for you.

853
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,435
That's something you
will have to do direct.

854
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,821
Clarify that.

855
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:12,570
- If it is an OFAC payment, right,

856
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,062
so say it's a payment
that the company is based

857
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:17,509
out of the United States.

858
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,150
Even though that, you know,

859
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,040
it might be their subsidiary
out of another country,

860
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,810
now you have to worry about whether or not

861
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,360
you can pay the ransom out of that country

862
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,130
and for the United States,

863
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,620
so you still need to comply with OFAC

864
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,101
But going back to what
Jodi said, you know,

865
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:33,190
you have to make sure now you're complying

866
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,981
with all the states of the
United States, plus the GDPR,

867
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:40,250
plus any other countries
that have their own privacy.

868
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,973
So these things tack on and on, right?

869
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,130
And that's where insurance can help you

870
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,930
because we deal with this regularly.

871
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,370
This is something that
sadly we're dealing with

872
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,609
on a daily basis,

873
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,790
while this client may
have only dealt with it

874
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,298
this would be the first time.

875
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:57,692
We connect them with the law firms,

876
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:01,129
both in the United States
and in Europe, in Asia,

877
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,089
wherever the event has occurred.

878
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,830
You know, we work with the law enforcement

879
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,477
in all of the different, you
know, global geo sites, right,

880
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:11,391
these different locations.

881
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:14,618
We are able to help them
make those kinds of payments

882
00:36:14,618 --> 00:36:16,670
and do that advisory

883
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,403
because we've been doing
this for a while, right,

884
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:22,662
so we know how to make this work,

885
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:25,058
and the counsel knows
how to make this work,

886
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,133
and the forensics firm
know how to make it work.

887
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:33,570
- So recently, the ABA
published formal opinion 498

888
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,050
around virtual law practices,

889
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,720
and I know that's specific obviously

890
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,390
to law lawyers and law firms.

891
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,194
But one of the pillars in that was

892
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:43,750
the obligation to review contracts

893
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,413
with hardware and software
application vendors

894
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,706
to determine how well they
were handling confidentiality

895
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,860
and privacy issues.

896
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,700
And I think, you know, I think
that's easier said than done.

897
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,160
And Jodi, I'd really like you to start off

898
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,529
and weigh in on this one

899
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,090
because that gets real
complicated, real fast.

900
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,963
Like you use Office 365,

901
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,057
well, I think in everyone's mind we say,

902
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:05,399
"I'm sitting in, you know, Atlanta,

903
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,710
so I'm probably based on
some server farm in the U.S."

904
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,230
Well, A, that's not true.

905
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,300
It may actually be backed
up in Ireland, in the EU.

906
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,900
And worse than that, often
these types of services,

907
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,070
so Amazon, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple,

908
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,449
all of them use what's
called fragmentation.

909
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:23,799
So your data is actually
torn apart and scattered

910
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:26,130
it may be in like 20 or 30 countries.

911
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,780
So, you know, realistically,
how can you manage that?

912
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,630
- Well, it's certainly
going to be something

913
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,730
where you need a team to make
sure that you're reviewing

914
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,790
all the different parts.

915
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,610
You're going to have your privacy

916
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,880
and understanding the data.

917
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,950
You know, Catherine, as
you've been talking about,

918
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,627
really understanding,
right, where your data is

919
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,150
and what type you have.

920
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,696
And then understanding
a little bit further

921
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:50,130
the types of services.

922
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,190
So as you just mentioned,
if I have Microsoft 365,

923
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,860
having a counterpart in that company,

924
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,810
understanding what the
agreement's going to say.

925
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,370
Many of these have kind of
their data protection addendums,

926
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,977
and this is a common question

927
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:08,220
between cross border movements,
especially under GDPR,

928
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,799
between the U.S. and the EU.

929
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,570
So many of these types
of technology services

930
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,920
will outline here's where
this type of data is.

931
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,160
So Mark Sangster, as you had
mentioned around fragmentation,

932
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,620
you'll be able to, in many cases,

933
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,380
either talk to or utilize their websites

934
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,850
to help you navigate and understand,

935
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,600
well, the type of data
you have is going to be

936
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,433
in this country,

937
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,550
this type of data is going to
be over here in that country.

938
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,404
But we really need to
do your due diligence,

939
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:34,879
at least when you first sign on them,

940
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,004
and then on some type of
ongoing regular cadence

941
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,854
to continue that review,

942
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:42,202
and especially in the contract review.

943
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:43,900
And it often is going to show up

944
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,453
in a data protection addendum.

945
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,723
- Right.

946
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,730
- I guess what I would
add to what Jodi is saying

947
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,730
from my perspective,

948
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,772
so let's talk about
some of the professions.

949
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,634
Certain state bars, New
York is one of them,

950
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:59,860
part of lawyer ethics is
maintaining confidentiality.

951
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,150
And part of that now for certain states

952
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,189
is that you have good cybersecurity

953
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,600
because if they're able
to hack into the law firm,

954
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,080
we are a treasure trove

955
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,060
of all kinds of confidential information.

956
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,470
I remember last year,

957
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,105
a law firm was ransomwared,

958
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:16,376
and they started leaking Lady
Gaga's personal contracts

959
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,460
on the dark web.

960
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,680
The accounting profession, similar thing.

961
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,339
And kind of what I talked about before is

962
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,640
what it says in your contracts

963
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,866
around liability and insurance.

964
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,597
I've had to explain to
general counsels that,

965
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:35,290
"Hey, if you include a
cybersecurity or data breach

966
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,529
in your indemnity clause,

967
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,130
you could invalidate your insurance

968
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,829
because certain insurance
contracts will say

969
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:45,426
this you cannot indemnify blanket."

970
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,540
Certain things for data
breaches have to be excluded.

971
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,530
And you have so many people who just rely

972
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,790
on the legal boiler plate

973
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,075
and don't understand how
cyber risk and privacy risk

974
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:57,544
permeate that contract,

975
00:39:57,544 --> 00:40:00,069
and they only find out
when they get into a breach

976
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,990
and realize, "You mean my
liability to my customer is 10X,

977
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:08,009
and the vendor's liability
to me is $10,000?"

978
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,470
Repeatedly I've seen that.

979
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,109
So when you're looking at these contracts,

980
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,260
I can't overemphasize enough,

981
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,780
understand what you're signing,

982
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,810
understand the privacy and
cyber risks that you're taking,

983
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,560
and how to have it in
the contract that says

984
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,150
if your vendor has a data breach,

985
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,520
they're required to tell you

986
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,110
and they're required to cooperate with you

987
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,863
because if you don't, I
assure you, they won't.

988
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,753
- I will just add,

989
00:40:28,753 --> 00:40:30,280
I think that's why it's so important

990
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,440
to have a team be a part of this.

991
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,770
You need someone on the legal side

992
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,880
who's going to be able to
really review that contract

993
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,864
and dissect much of what
you've just talked about.

994
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:41,720
You need someone on
the business or IT side

995
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,839
who's really going to understand

996
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,970
the type of data that's involved.

997
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,810
And someone also from the
privacy side and compliance side

998
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,180
to understand the obligations.

999
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,163
Collectively that team will
be in a much better position

1000
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:57,223
than maybe just one of
those people reviewing it.

1001
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,680
- So, Jodi, what's it like
if you're in a position

1002
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,319
where you have to report
to or notify a regulator?

1003
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,830
Like, what kind of information
are they looking for?

1004
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,663
Marc Debrody earlier
gave us examples of the

1005
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:12,920
sort of the forensics type of telemetry

1006
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
that he's looking for,

1007
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,090
but from a privacy perspective
or regulatory perspective,

1008
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,984
what should you be prepared
to report and hand over?

1009
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:22,397
- Well, it's going to be really similar

1010
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,670
to some of what we've
already been talking about,

1011
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,640
which is what type of event it was

1012
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,759
and also the volume, so how
many people were impacted.

1013
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,303
So you're going to need to know,

1014
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,170
again, kind of going back to the data,

1015
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,790
I feel like a broken record over here,

1016
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,000
but know your data, know
your data, know your data.

1017
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,597
And so if you leave here,

1018
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,720
understand that you should
just know your data,

1019
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,939
but truly how many people were involved.

1020
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,773
Was it 50?

1021
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:45,606
5,000?

1022
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:46,630
10,000?

1023
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,920
1 million?

1024
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,840
And it's important to really
make sure that you have...

1025
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,930
Now, Justin, you always talk about

1026
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,750
it's hard to know all those
facts in the beginning.

1027
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,420
And some of these obligations
require you to report

1028
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,760
in potentially 72 hours.

1029
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,370
You don't always have all
the facts in 72 hours.

1030
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,697
So you need to be mindful and really work

1031
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,814
through the communications appropriately,

1032
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:10,243
but they're going to want
to know the type of data,

1033
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:12,667
the type of incident
that it might've been,

1034
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,150
the volume as well,

1035
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,730
and then, again, kind of the type of data,

1036
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,240
like is it name, is it sensitive data

1037
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,939
to be able to trigger those obligations,

1038
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,263
and what you're going to do
about protecting in the future?

1039
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,250
- So this is pretty complicated.

1040
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,940
And, you know, we've
talked about having teams

1041
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,070
and a lot of resources,

1042
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,980
but what do small to medium size firms do?

1043
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,310
Like how can you help?

1044
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,620
Marc, how can you help?

1045
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,810
And same thing, Catherine?

1046
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,440
Like, you know, not everybody
has that sort of the,

1047
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,260
you know, the amount of
resources that we'd see

1048
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,180
with say a large bank.

1049
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,013
- Sure.

1050
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:49,846
Well, I'll start with that one.

1051
00:42:49,846 --> 00:42:51,030
Maybe we can go round robin.

1052
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,810
So, you know, we help a lot of
small and midsize companies.

1053
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,395
I think kind of the concept
of the fractional team

1054
00:42:57,395 --> 00:43:00,157
really works well for
a small organization.

1055
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:03,300
And whether you're small
or big shouldn't change

1056
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,210
the types of relationships you have.

1057
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,590
It just might be someone's on the outside

1058
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,910
who needs to get to know
your business really well

1059
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,249
and who's familiar with the organization

1060
00:43:12,249 --> 00:43:14,859
and the privacy obligations.

1061
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,970
So we'll work with,

1062
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,009
whether it's inside or
outside counsel, you know,

1063
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,090
making sure that they've gone
through a tabletop exercise

1064
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,010
or having an incident plan

1065
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,415
and knowing who their
insurance carrier is.

1066
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:30,020
I spoke with a company
yesterday, they're 50 employees,

1067
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,890
and they've done an
incident response plan.

1068
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,640
They know who their insurance carrier is.

1069
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,031
They have someone on the phone
roster for law enforcement.

1070
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:40,750
And many of the parties are all external,

1071
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,850
but they've gone through
the process to make sure

1072
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,482
that they're familiar
with who and what to do.

1073
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,620
- And from that insurance part, right,

1074
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,650
we can put them in touch with,

1075
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,980
because we have these contacts,

1076
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,473
we have our forensic
panel, our counsel panel,

1077
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,650
our PR panel, all of those elements.

1078
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,170
So the key, just as Jodi was saying,

1079
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,140
is make sure you know who
your insurance carrier is.

1080
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,714
We receive phone calls many
times where someone says,

1081
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:10,000
"I didn't even know we had insurance.

1082
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,788
The person before me, you know,
retained and got insurance.

1083
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:17,080
I don't even know what our policy covers."

1084
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,330
So having that available

1085
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,595
so that you know how to get in touch

1086
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,160
with your insurance carrier,

1087
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,136
doing that ahead of time.

1088
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:27,397
If you want, if you are saying,

1089
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:29,787
"Hey, we have a law firm that we use

1090
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:34,787
that specializes in privacy,
in breach response,"

1091
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,589
let your carrier know, let Coalition know.

1092
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,691
We can endorse them so that
when they are on your policy,

1093
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:43,290
you can go to them immediately,

1094
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,185
and they will notify us as well.

1095
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:50,110
But notifying us then lets
you have access to our rates,

1096
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,048
our forensic firms.

1097
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:54,479
We're able to walk you through

1098
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,618
what I call the happy path, right,

1099
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:59,158
which is the path to right the ship

1100
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:02,630
'cause your ship has, you
know, gone off kilter here,

1101
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,476
and we need to right it.

1102
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:08,380
And we do that through
all of these resources,

1103
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,790
these contacts,

1104
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,130
reaching out to, you
know, law enforcement,

1105
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,370
helping you recover funds.

1106
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,560
Identify do you need to
pay, don't you need to pay?

1107
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,610
How do you decide on those two things?

1108
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,240
Well, you go both paths, right?

1109
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,837
You entertain the threat actor
on the right hand side of,

1110
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:29,650
"Oh, we'd like to know
why you're looking to see

1111
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:31,230
if your backups are viable,

1112
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,470
why you're looking to see

1113
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,812
if you can get all of this
information together."

1114
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:37,915
And I know that everyone
thinks that insurance companies

1115
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:40,738
will just pay out and that's all they do,

1116
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,738
but in the cyber space,
we're very, very specific.

1117
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,712
And we actually help kind of
navigate and right that ship.

1118
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,690
- So I guess I'd like to talk about

1119
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,470
what I'm going to now call
the on-ramp to the happy path.

1120
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,799
And what I mean by that is

1121
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,840
I think insurance is an important tool,

1122
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,200
but it is not a panacea for
having good cyber hygiene.

1123
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,540
But when we talk about insurance,

1124
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,920
you really have to
understand what you're buying

1125
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,475
because there is no
uniform type of policy.

1126
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:18,770
And what I mean by that is

1127
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,720
how many of you have looked
at your insurance policy

1128
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,359
to see whether employee personal devices

1129
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,960
is included in the definition
of computer network

1130
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,300
or it isn't?

1131
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,810
Because if you have some type of incident

1132
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,580
that emanates from a personal device,

1133
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,840
that may not be covered
under your insurance.

1134
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,920
And I've had to have
plenty of conversations

1135
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,460
where I had to explain to the client

1136
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,640
when they thought they
had $2 million worth

1137
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,879
of business email compromise,

1138
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,500
and I'm like, "No, when I read the policy,

1139
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,190
it's really a hundred thousand dollars,

1140
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,950
and the brokers on the
phone," as you can imagine,

1141
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,640
the phone got quiet pretty quickly.

1142
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,129
And so what I'm saying is

1143
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,620
you really have to be smart

1144
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,210
and understand what
risks your business has

1145
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,740
from a cybersecurity perspective

1146
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,310
so that when you buy insurance,

1147
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,890
you understand that you're
tailoring it to your risks

1148
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,109
so that when you try to engage

1149
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,000
with Coalition or your insurer,

1150
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,050
that you have the right type of insurance

1151
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,530
for the type of risk that you have

1152
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,955
so that Catherine can bring
to bear all of the resources

1153
00:47:19,955 --> 00:47:23,009
that an insurance company can help

1154
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,160
all of these smaller
businesses who may not

1155
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,580
have the resources of the Fortune 500.

1156
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,860
- Justin, I used to call
that the feathering act,

1157
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,932
and shows my age a little
bit, it's an old Vegas show

1158
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:38,419
where there's a series of
feathers in front of the dancer,

1159
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,891
and they remove it and
they never see anything

1160
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,730
because the feathers are right behind it.

1161
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,110
And it's the same thing,

1162
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,796
we want where one insurance policy ends,

1163
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:49,180
the other to pick up.

1164
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,440
And while we play nice
with other insurance

1165
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,250
when there is that duplication, right,

1166
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,290
we have more insurance than needed,

1167
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,200
we work together and we
do that all the time.

1168
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,797
But you want to know that
if I'm covering this,

1169
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,930
and this goes to what
Jodi was talking before

1170
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,930
about knowing your inventory,

1171
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,116
knowing what you have
and where you keep it,

1172
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:09,900
because if you don't
know all of those things,

1173
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,115
when you think, "Oh, I don't
need funds transfer fraud,"

1174
00:48:13,115 --> 00:48:15,622
or, "I don't need regulatory," or, right,

1175
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:18,920
you're trying to carve
out to save some money,

1176
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,200
if you don't know what you have,

1177
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,051
then you don't know what to get.

1178
00:48:22,052 --> 00:48:26,770
And so you need to be and
work with your broker,

1179
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,787
work with the insurance carriers to say

1180
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:30,033
"Is this covered, is this?"

1181
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,761
And that comes through
your tabletops, right?

1182
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:36,120
Practicing of saying, "Hey,
let's try this event,"

1183
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,569
or "What if this changes, the facts?

1184
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,890
Would cover still exist?"

1185
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,125
Because not all insurance is
created equal and BOP, right,

1186
00:48:44,126 --> 00:48:47,010
your BOP or just your crime,

1187
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,870
isn't going to cover a lot of these events

1188
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,970
that we've been talking about.

1189
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,899
- And I'd add one more...
- Asking.

1190
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,733
- I'm sorry, Marc.

1191
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:54,566
I wanted to say...

1192
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:55,399
- No, go ahead, Justin.

1193
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,390
- That I think is really relevant is

1194
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,810
I've seen two different kinds of policies

1195
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,920
I've dealt with recently.

1196
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,887
One had a $10,000 deductible,

1197
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:05,709
the other one had a hundred
thousand dollar deductible.

1198
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,870
And I think it's important that

1199
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,500
you need to really think long and hard

1200
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,380
about how much you're really going to save

1201
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,680
if you get a lower premium

1202
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,720
to have a hundred
thousand dollar deductible

1203
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,948
because when you have
to hire forensic, legal,

1204
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:21,187
you're going to run through
that a hundred thousand dollars

1205
00:49:21,188 --> 00:49:22,260
pretty quickly.

1206
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,724
And whatever cost savings you
have is just out the window.

1207
00:49:25,724 --> 00:49:27,759
So I would just say think really carefully

1208
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:31,240
when you want to get a
deductible that's that high.

1209
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,790
- Justin, are you saying
you're very expensive, or?

1210
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,163
I want to add to the conversation

1211
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:40,910
with regards to what law
enforcement can contribute

1212
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,290
to small medium-sized businesses

1213
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,279
because I think it's a
great question to ask.

1214
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,192
And personally, I love engaging
with those kinds of people

1215
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,358
and organizations because they don't,

1216
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:52,790
like several folks just mentioned here,

1217
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,220
that they don't have the resources often

1218
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,897
to do the things that
larger organizations do

1219
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:01,560
to include educating employees
on cyber hygiene and whatnot.

1220
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,860
So of course there's a lot
of small, medium businesses

1221
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,297
in every, you know, every jurisdiction,

1222
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,550
and we can't do every one individually.

1223
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,040
What I encourage folks to
do is to be part of like,

1224
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,700
your local chamber of commerce.

1225
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,089
And I've done several speeches
to chambers of commerces

1226
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:16,700
and other organizations, you know,

1227
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,620
associations of realtor associations

1228
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,850
that maybe are engaged in, you know,

1229
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,069
real estate transactions where
we see a lot of fraud there.

1230
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,030
So speaking to large groups is
really more effective for us.

1231
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,370
I mean, we certainly do
one-offs on occasion.

1232
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,259
But when we do talk to folks,

1233
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,920
we help them try to frame cyber...

1234
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,508
I love to use protection analogies.

1235
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:36,750
You know, in Secret Service,

1236
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,240
most folks probably on this call here

1237
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,649
would only know us for
our protective world,

1238
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,750
but you know, we work in
this circle of protection

1239
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,843
where we have an outer,
inner, and middle perimeter.

1240
00:50:48,843 --> 00:50:51,627
And it's certainly same
in cyber world, too.

1241
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:54,049
And we talk about, you
know, framing all of this

1242
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,249
in the context of, you know,

1243
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:59,850
people, processes and technology, right?

1244
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,548
And so we talk about training people.

1245
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:03,459
I mean, that's the critical part.

1246
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,370
I mean, you're only as secure
as that 18 year old intern

1247
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,370
that's at the keyboard over
the summer, clicking away,

1248
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,890
you know, and not trained
on phishing emails.

1249
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,060
So we love to engage in
that and be a part of that.

1250
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,582
And it kind of circles back
around to my original point is,

1251
00:51:17,582 --> 00:51:20,167
you know, establish
that relationship early.

1252
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:23,483
And so you can be offered those things.

1253
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,080
- Hey, Catherine, a question came in here

1254
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,487
about the Zurich versus
Mondelez court case

1255
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,870
that's going on, just real recap.

1256
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,180
That was a company that was hit by

1257
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,680
the NotPetya ransomware attack,

1258
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,344
and there's a lot of
attribution about that being,

1259
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,690
you know, tracked back to Russia,

1260
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,870
and then it was actually
part of the aggression

1261
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,630
in the Crimea and the Ukraine.

1262
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,290
And at that point, Zurich,
who was the carrier,

1263
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:51,315
refused to pay for ransoms and damages

1264
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:53,840
citing act of war.

1265
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,260
So you're in that industry,

1266
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,760
what's your opinion on that,

1267
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,590
and where you think this is going?

1268
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,550
- Well, there's been case law,

1269
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,300
and I'm going to call on Justin to help

1270
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,600
a little bit as well on this,

1271
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,493
but there's been clear case
law about the war aspect,

1272
00:52:08,494 --> 00:52:12,347
and it needs to be a declaration of war.

1273
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:15,640
This actually goes all
the way back to 9/11,

1274
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,430
when this was first,

1275
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:22,430
the whole declaration of war
was necessary versus terrorism.

1276
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,680
And so now, the cyber
carriers might, you know,

1277
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,169
ourselves included,

1278
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,790
when it's, you know, an
act of this cyber act,

1279
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,920
it is not an act of war.

1280
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,155
This is more, you know, just
the ransomware, et cetera.

1281
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:40,380
The other part though,
with Zurich and Mondelez

1282
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,869
also had with the type of policy it was

1283
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,430
and the various wording.

1284
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,221
So it's much more in depth than just war,

1285
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:51,197
but really for cyber policies,

1286
00:52:51,197 --> 00:52:52,942
it doesn't come into play,

1287
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:57,453
and it needs to be a
declaration by a country.

1288
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:02,160
I don't know if Justin
wants to add anything there.

1289
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,899
- I think what I will add to that is

1290
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:09,759
when I review a cybersecurity
insurance policy,

1291
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,110
it is one of the most
challenging contracts to review.

1292
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:13,943
It's very dense.

1293
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:14,960
There's a lot in there.

1294
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,090
I think the lesson to
be learned when we talk

1295
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,860
about the Zurich case is
that is in the context of

1296
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,870
hundreds of millions
of dollars of payments

1297
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,900
that have to be made,

1298
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,290
and there are companies
that will take positions

1299
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:31,750
because they're looking at
what the potential outlay is.

1300
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,190
And I think you really need
to think about that case

1301
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,570
in a wider context of ransomware
has gone through the roof.

1302
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,000
The insurance carriers have been hit

1303
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,340
with all kinds of claims.

1304
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,750
And I have had several clients
who re up their insurance

1305
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,780
after having a cyber claim,

1306
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,930
and their rates are going up by 40%.

1307
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,540
So when I think about the Zurich case,

1308
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,820
I guess I'm looking at
the wider perspective of

1309
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,880
if you are relying on
your insurance as a tool,

1310
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,100
which you should, but not a panacea,

1311
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,610
you have to expect that
the ransomware coverage

1312
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,250
is going to change dramatically

1313
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,610
because of the avalanche of claims

1314
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:09,370
that have gone on last year
and the beginning of this year.

1315
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,029
- And it may change.

1316
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,552
It's not changing on
our side for Coalition,

1317
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:19,552
but the fact is that
knowing, to your point,

1318
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
having that stronger security,

1319
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,270
suring up your systems, right?

1320
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,410
It's not, insurance is not a pan...

1321
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,350
It doesn't fix all, right.

1322
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,450
And there's many times where

1323
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,397
things that you were like,

1324
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:34,279
"Oh, well, gosh, we incurred this too."

1325
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,970
We don't fix everything.

1326
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,299
So the way to fix everything

1327
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,065
is to prevent it from happening.

1328
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:42,080
And that's one of the
things that you can also do

1329
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,904
in working with outside entities,

1330
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:48,102
working with carriers that
are kind of these insure-tech,

1331
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:50,490
right, just as like Coalition,

1332
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,000
where we scan the universe

1333
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,174
and treat you as if we are the hacker

1334
00:54:55,174 --> 00:54:57,680
and tell you where your weaknesses are

1335
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,611
so that you can sure
up your system as well.

1336
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:02,569
It's not a fix-all,

1337
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,910
but our in purpose,

1338
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,390
our purpose is to insure
insurance insurers.

1339
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,540
Like, that's what we're doing.

1340
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,493
We're making sure insurance works.

1341
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,520
- So Catherine, I wanna
make sure that everybody

1342
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,220
has a chance for some final thoughts

1343
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,430
'cause we have about five
minutes left on the docket today.

1344
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:21,310
So real quick, AXA pulled
ransomware payment coverage

1345
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:22,163
in France.

1346
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:24,730
You know, crystal ball,
do you see this spreading,

1347
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,559
or where do you think that's going to go?

1348
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,010
- I don't see it spreading.

1349
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:32,135
I see some carriers that perhaps
didn't underwrite as well

1350
00:55:32,135 --> 00:55:34,274
changing their position.

1351
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:36,852
Those that are confident
in their underwriting,

1352
00:55:36,852 --> 00:55:39,029
staying the course.

1353
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,320
This isn't something
that's going anywhere.

1354
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,820
To what Marc had said before,

1355
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:46,080
we're not going to make
a victim of the victim.

1356
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,067
We're here to make sure
that insurance works

1357
00:55:49,068 --> 00:55:52,223
and to solve cyber risk ultimately.

1358
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,010
- Fantastic.

1359
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,480
So we've got about four minutes left,

1360
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,140
so we have our next steps here.

1361
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,049
I'm just going to go
through them very quickly.

1362
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,940
So engage the C-suite, right,

1363
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,910
as we talked about earlier.

1364
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,844
Make sure that it isn't
just technical solutions

1365
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,690
and programs that you're looking at,

1366
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,550
but the business ones

1367
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,310
because they're often business decisions

1368
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,200
that come out of this.

1369
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,980
We're going to, you know,
disable remote access,

1370
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,813
and the next thing you know,

1371
00:56:13,813 --> 00:56:15,610
you realize that's going
to make this event public,

1372
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,030
so maybe that's not something
you want, your IT department.

1373
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,447
Obviously consult, connect,
and work proactively

1374
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:23,570
with law enforcement
and your insurer, right.

1375
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,570
Get them involved.

1376
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,244
Know who to call.

1377
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:27,400
Know Marc by name and
know his phone number

1378
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,599
rather than calling 1-800 I'm in trouble.

1379
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,940
Over the next three months,

1380
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,960
build out your response
plan, develop your team,

1381
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,970
test them, make sure
as Jodi's talked about,

1382
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,759
you understand your obligations,
you understand the assets,

1383
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,660
they're classified, you
know where they are,

1384
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,259
where they move and so on

1385
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,560
so that you can deal with that.

1386
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,200
If something occurs, you know
what your obligations are.

1387
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,839
And then over the six months,
this is the long slog, right?

1388
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,440
This is the building
out your risk registry,

1389
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,900
running risk assessments, prioritizing,

1390
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,190
conducting simulations, working tabletops.

1391
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,260
And again, you know, I
can't say it enough, right,

1392
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,660
engage with law enforcement.

1393
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,180
So we've got three minutes left,

1394
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,361
so let's go super quick here.

1395
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:04,716
So for final thoughts, I'm going to start

1396
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:05,670
at the far end of the panel here,

1397
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,863
so Catherine, go.

1398
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,080
- Make sure you have insurance,

1399
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,740
know what your insurance covers,

1400
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,676
and make sure that you can
rely on those panelists

1401
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:19,000
to reach out to people like
Marc and Justin and Jodi.

1402
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,833
- Fantastic.

1403
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:20,940
Jodi?

1404
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,030
- Definitely know your data.

1405
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,471
I'm going to also add

1406
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,580
about training your employees.

1407
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,160
There's some very basic, you know,

1408
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,100
blocking and tackling
that our employees can do.

1409
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,740
So if you don't already have,

1410
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,884
make sure that you look
into some basic privacy

1411
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,930
and security training.

1412
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,763
- Fantastic.

1413
00:57:37,763 --> 00:57:39,020
Marc?

1414
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,450
- You don't have to look far
in the newspapers to see that

1415
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,984
these issues are front and center.

1416
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:49,244
And without phone calls from victims,

1417
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:50,930
there is no attribution.

1418
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,660
I mean, we need to know about it.

1419
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,870
So we encourage you, if you
haven't caught the message yet,

1420
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,069
is to establish those relationships

1421
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,540
with law enforcement
early on the front end

1422
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,770
before these incidents happen.

1423
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,470
Secretservice.gov is going
to be your website for us

1424
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,399
where we have on our investigations tab

1425
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,382
a link to our cyber task forces.

1426
00:58:09,382 --> 00:58:13,210
We have a link to IC3 and all
these other things as well.

1427
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,183
So please engage with us early and often.

1428
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:18,510
Thank you.
- Fantastic.

1429
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:19,653
Final word, Justin.

1430
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,740
- I'm going to leave with
a thought for the audience,

1431
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,200
and that's this, how do
we make cybersecurity

1432
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:29,170
the digital seatbelt of the 21st century?

1433
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,450
We get in the car nowadays,

1434
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,830
we don't even think twice,
and we engage our seatbelt.

1435
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,610
But that wasn't always the case,

1436
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,050
and I think cybersecurity is the same way.

1437
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,350
And we need to educate,
we may have to pass laws.

1438
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,410
And one of the things key
things is how do we rethink

1439
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,720
how the public and private
sector collaborate,

1440
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,660
and today is a great example of that.

1441
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,979
How can we better rethink
how to proactively

1442
00:58:50,979 --> 00:58:53,513
collaborate with law enforcement?

1443
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,073
- Terrific.

1444
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:56,920
Thank you, Justin.

1445
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,580
So again, to all the panelists,

1446
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,810
to Justin, to Marc, Jodi and Catherine,

1447
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,950
thank you very much for your time today,

1448
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,160
for sharing your experiences,

1449
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,839
your observations, and
your recommendations.

1450
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,580
And thanks to you too, the attendees,

1451
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,966
who have joined us for this session.

1452
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:12,970
So I'll just leave you
with a few things here.

1453
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,078
We highly encourage you to fill out

1454
00:59:16,078 --> 00:59:18,430
the session feedback form.

1455
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,827
We love to hear from you.

1456
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:23,000
And also if you'd like a
copy of this presentation,

1457
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,530
it is available now in
the virtual environment

1458
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,632
from the session description page,

1459
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:31,310
as is an accompanying white
paper that we authored

1460
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,152
that goes into all of these topics

1461
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:36,380
in more of a sort of a prescriptive detail

1462
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,640
to kind of help you, at least start,

1463
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,529
as a bit of a framework.

1464
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:41,660
So I wouldn't quite
say it's comprehensive,

1465
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,100
but at the same time, it's a good start,

1466
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,240
particularly for small and
medium sized enterprises.

1467
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,379
And if nothing else,
it's a conversation piece

1468
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,140
that you can take back to your boards

1469
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,700
after having attended this session,

1470
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,364
realizing that these
issues are far more complex

1471
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:54,212
than they look on the surface.

1472
00:59:54,212 --> 00:59:56,210
So again, thanks very
much to our panelists.

1473
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,120
Thank you, attendees.

1474
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,470
This concludes the session.
