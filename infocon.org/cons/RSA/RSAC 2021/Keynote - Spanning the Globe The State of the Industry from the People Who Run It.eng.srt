1
00:00:00,663 --> 00:00:03,246
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,870
- Welcome everybody.

3
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,269
Thanks so much for joining this session.

4
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,010
And I hope you're having a
great RSA Conference, 2021.

5
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,370
Can't wait to see you in person next year,

6
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,839
but I am so excited about this session.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,550
It's something that
we've been thinking about

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,440
for months and months.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,440
It's how do we bring to
you those little insights,

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,820
those things that you pick
up when you're walking around

11
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,652
at the conference,

12
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:11,130
when you're moving from
meeting to meeting and you run

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,179
into people that maybe
you haven't seen in a year

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
and you just calibrate, you
learn what they're up to.

15
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,880
You share what you're up to.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,860
You share ideas and concepts.

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,679
So this year we're
bringing the world to you

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,850
and we're spanning the globe going to some

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,890
of the most influential

20
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,770
and insightful security
leaders on the planet.

21
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,640
And think about these as little vignettes,

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,730
little interactions with
those security leaders

23
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,420
of what's on their mind.

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,020
What have they been thinking
about during this pandemic?

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,009
And more importantly, how are
they planning going forward?

26
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,470
So I hope you enjoy this session

27
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,013
and incredible, incredible
folks have joined us.

28
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,606
(upbeat music)

29
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,769
- Hey Florence.

30
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,110
- Hey, Hugh.

31
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,210
- Hey, thanks so much for being here.

32
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,230
- Oh, my pleasure, thanks for having me.

33
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,049
- Oh my gosh, it's so great to see you.

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,070
I was trying to think before the call

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,980
how long we've been friends.

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,399
It's twenty

37
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:46,805
- 24, I think.

38
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:50,343
- 24 years, amazing, oh my gosh.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,459
It's so great to see you as always.

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,460
And, what an incredible
time it's been in the world

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,070
in general, and for us as
security professionals.

42
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,070
You sit on top as the SVP
of information security

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,040
and the global CISO of Ahold Delhaize.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,040
And this is one of the largest
organizations in the world.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,860
If you could maybe just
give us some context

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,010
of all of the demands

47
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,310
that sit under the umbrella that you have.

48
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,700
- Yeah, absolutely.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
So Ahold Delhaize is a
74 billion Euro company

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,980
and we have 19 consumer facing brands.

51
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,489
And so if you look at it
from a store perspective,

52
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,403
we have over 7,000 stores
in eight countries.

53
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,410
To give you examples of brands,

54
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,470
I mean, in the US you'll
find a Hannaford, Food Lion,

55
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,673
Giant, Peapod.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,187
In Europe, you'll find the
Albert Heijn in the Netherlands,

57
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:04,113
Alfa Beta in Greece, Albert
in Czech, and many others.

58
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,310
- And it's incredible.

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,270
I remember talking to you a
few months ago asking about,

60
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,870
we're seeing a lot of
companies having to deal

61
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,870
with the challenges of
offboarding people in this crisis.

62
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,680
And I remember you telling me,
what are you talking about?

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,560
We just onboarded some massive
massive number of people.

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,560
I can only imagine how
it's been in that industry

65
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,300
of how you've had to lump up.

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,133
- Yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:42,280
It's true that we had a very
strong performance in 2020

68
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,780
and we recognized that it's
positive for our company

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,340
but before I go into detail,

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,669
I just want to say that we
wish we had achieved that

71
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,520
under very different circumstances

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,310
because we are very much aware

73
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,463
of many who would have
been less fortunate.

74
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,830
And so for us, it's been
a little bit of fair.

75
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,793
It's been a very humbling time.

76
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,750
But to go back to your point,

77
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,110
yes we ended up hiring
45,000 people in 2020.

78
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,520
And so obviously in stores,

79
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
there is the usual onboarding process

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,780
but everything else
has been done remotely.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,960
And so it's been challenging,
we rose up to the challenge,

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,592
but it's been interesting.

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,990
- I couldn't even imagine.

84
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,560
I mean, not just having to deal

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,180
with the physical security implications

86
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,120
and the new protocols

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,450
and the things that have
to happen in a store,

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,940
but also suddenly
everybody's working remotely

89
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:56,550
and Florence, you excel in a crisis.

90
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,023
I mean, you excel actually in everything.

91
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,210
But I'm curious that the
kind of stress this puts

92
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,440
on a team when you've got a
global security organization

93
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,910
that's now being asked to
secure this massive ecosystem

94
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,180
that's critical to society.

95
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,113
How do you manage the team
through something like that?

96
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,330
- Yeah, it's interesting
that you mentioned that

97
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,500
because as security professionals,

98
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,560
we are used to dealing with crises.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,400
And so maybe that's why
we're really good at it.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,070
We're expected to be calm,

101
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,082
we're expected to be the strong ones.

102
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,470
But the COVID-19 crisis was very different

103
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,233
in that it also affected
all of us personally.

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,080
And so very quickly I
realized that everyone

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,609
in the team was trying
to put on a brave face

106
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,273
and act as if they had
everything under control.

107
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,429
I think I was doing
that too but the fact is

108
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,620
that we were all
struggling in our own way.

109
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,620
And so I held a town
hall just under two weeks

110
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,520
after lock down with my entire team.

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,520
And I shared that for me, it
had been hard combining work

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,580
and helping my daughters
with distance learning.

113
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,423
That I was worried about my
family, about my grandmother.

114
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:34,410
And I asked my team to store this concept

115
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,530
that I called the vitamin shots.

116
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,049
And so each team leader, every morning,

117
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,050
held a 30 minutes meeting to
talk about what people felt.

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,130
I mean, no content,

119
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,733
just our struggles, our fears
of where we needed help.

120
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,210
And I really encouraged the entire team

121
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,530
to share as much as they felt
comfortable with, of course

122
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,080
but just to share what others
could do for them and to

123
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,570
just develop that system where
they could trust each other.

124
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,313
And that really helped it
worked out really well.

125
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,930
- What an amazing way
to inject just comradery

126
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,891
at a time when people feel
so distant from one another.

127
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,330
And I love what you just said,

128
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,380
how you started it out
just about yourself.

129
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Look, I'm a mom too and
I have parents and I,

130
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,630
it's something that we need
to be a lot better about,

131
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,159
I think, in the security space.

132
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,209
And I love this, I love the
way you've named it too.

133
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,260
The vitamin shot or the vitamin injection.

134
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,520
That's a, it's like the
way to start your day.

135
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,390
- Yeah, it's a bit like the vaccine,

136
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,410
except that it was a bit earlier.

137
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,560
We were trying to do
something a bit novel.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,913
Yeah.

139
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:01,820
You know what's interesting about it too,

140
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,080
is so we have a global team and

141
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,640
that call really helped
folks stay connected

142
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,449
with people they used to see every day.

143
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,110
But it also built
relationships between people

144
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,100
in different countries.

145
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,780
And so these folks used to
be in meetings together,

146
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,839
talk about content,

147
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,220
but I don't think they really
knew each other personally.

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,070
And that really bridged the gap.

149
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,520
It's really nice to see,

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,770
very proud of the way
the team came together

151
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,089
- Florence, I can't thank you enough

152
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,470
for being a part of this
and everything you do.

153
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,830
I mean, I know the role
that your company plays

154
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,830
in distributing food to the
world, is such an immense one.

155
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,900
And I'm so happy that you're at the helm

156
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,010
on the security side of making sure that

157
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,350
that's a safe process.

158
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,040
So thanks so much, Florence,
so great seeing you.

159
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,439
- Thank you very much, Hugh.

160
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:08,025
(upbeat music)

161
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,660
- Hey, Marene, it's so great to see you.

162
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,733
- Hey, Hugh good to see you too.

163
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,660
- Thanks for joining us,
thanks for joining us.

164
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,780
- It's a pleasure to be here.

165
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,180
I always love to spend some
good time with old friends.

166
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,729
- The same here, same here and oh my gosh,

167
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,273
what an incredible,
incredible year it's been.

168
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,160
It's hard to even think back pre COVID

169
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,060
and one of the reasons I
wanted to chat with you,

170
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,050
is just get your views on,

171
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,490
this has been such a
remarkable time in the world.

172
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,090
As the chief information security officer

173
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,120
for one of the largest
companies in the world,

174
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,750
critical role in society.

175
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,800
What are some of the biggest
challenges that you faced?

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,709
What have you learned,
this is, it seems like,

177
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,480
it seems like it's been
a complete whirlwind.

178
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,270
- Yeah, you know, last January,
and the last time we were

179
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,290
in person together Hugh, it was RSA.

180
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,740
I mean, that was what was amazing.

181
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,320
It was at Aspen seminar, was
the last time we saw each other

182
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,980
and we're all kind of looking
at what was gonna happen.

183
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,560
Like we knew something
big was gonna happen

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,550
but we didn't know how big.

185
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,550
And as we felt a healthcare crisis coming,

186
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,300
we didn't realize it was also gonna be,

187
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,180
a huge digital opportunity
was gonna happen for us.

188
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,260
And as this digital
opportunity happened to us,

189
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,280
the role of the CISO
at major corporations,

190
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,370
became a huge role
because our four threats

191
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,370
that we have, nation states,
criminal, insider threat,

192
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,709
hacktivists, it seemed like

193
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,400
once they went home and
stopped working in corporations

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,959
that the whole world went wild for us.

195
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,960
And so CISOs about a 30%
increase in just cyber crime

196
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,050
and cyber activity.

197
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,050
Everybody was looking at how
they could monetize on COVID.

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,340
And for a company like Johnson and Johnson

199
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,340
where we went into vaccine development,

200
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,210
and I always tell people,
I try to be incognito.

201
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,960
I don't wanna be the
best person out in front

202
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,550
and be the target up in front,

203
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,599
I just want to be right
in front of the bear

204
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,050
but have a few people behind me.

205
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,050
And unfortunately, like I'm just running,

206
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,540
with COVID it made us a target.

207
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,000
With COVID and the vaccine
development, we became a target

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and healthcare in general
saw over a 30% rise in cyber,

209
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,680
whether it was a ransomware
attacks or DDoS attacks

210
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,680
but it just became, it put
us having to do our best,

211
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,240
our very, very best work

212
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,450
in cyber resiliency for our companies.

213
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,550
- Well look, I've known
you for a long time.

214
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,500
I couldn't imagine a
better person at the helm

215
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,160
during that time of challenging activity.

216
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,160
And what did you do to rally your team

217
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,569
but also to get the company
behind the fact that,

218
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,660
hey, we do have this
nuance slot of threats

219
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,740
and we've got security
procedures in place today,

220
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,430
but here's what we need to do right now.

221
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,550
- Yeah, Hugh, one of the very
first things, I took a pause

222
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,550
and I thought about the
magnitude of what was before us,

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,080
before my organization,

224
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,090
before my information security
risk management group.

225
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,680
And you know when you
know something is big

226
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,969
but you really don't know how big it is,

227
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,350
and being able to use almost
everything I've learned

228
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,940
whether it was my time at West Point,

229
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,620
my time in the military,

230
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,490
all the companies that
I had worked in cyber

231
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,120
and all the things I had learned at J&J

232
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
to be able to take an
arrow out of the quiver

233
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,180
and be able to say, I
got this, we got this

234
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,120
and bring together.

235
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,750
And it wasn't just the
information security organization,

236
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,980
it was the whole risk management at J&J

237
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,030
and looking at our physical
security, our brand protection,

238
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,480
our supply chain security

239
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,320
and working alongside our business.

240
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,530
And at times it was like,
I'm not sure I've been

241
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,650
on this ground before, but
it's starting to feel familiar

242
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,490
we're gonna make it through

243
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,240
and to see J&J cradle in action,

244
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,670
where people come together
for healthcare for humanity

245
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,829
and the common good, made
it, didn't make it easier

246
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,363
but made it harder to carry the water.

247
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,530
- I can only imagine.

248
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,290
I mean, what an incredible
mission you've been on

249
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,290
and I can only imagine
how gratifying it must be

250
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,850
to have had a huge
milestone in that mission.

251
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,720
J&J has been so productive
during this period,

252
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
it's not like, hey, all
these strengths are here.

253
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,810
And so we've got to
really lock the place down

254
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,780
and that's how productivity has gone down.

255
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,430
In fact, it seems like just opposite.

256
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,010
- Now, it really was
an amazing and I think,

257
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,840
it's J&J was ready to pivot
into the digital economy.

258
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,710
And there's a lot of
discussion in the IT world

259
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,880
about this new digital economy.

260
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,370
And then people are trying
to figure out what it means.

261
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,520
For me it's data outside my four walls.

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,970
That's what digital economy means.

263
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,310
I'm gonna have to protect
the data somewhere else.

264
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,400
But companies that were already prepared

265
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,630
with VPN connections or Office 365,

266
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,470
or any other of the cloud services,

267
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,070
or using the cloud, it wasn't a struggle.

268
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,950
It was just a slide into the
new way we're gonna do things

269
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,210
with digital.

270
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,390
And when you're able to do
that very, very quickly,

271
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,390
the business continues to
do what the business does

272
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,050
and supporting it with our IT organization

273
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,880
and our security
organization was phenomenal

274
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,880
to see the success, not
only in drug development

275
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,330
but our medical devices,
our consumer division

276
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,190
and to look at new ways,

277
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,090
innovative ways that we
were gonna deliver medicines

278
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,339
and medicine and how
healthcare will change

279
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,449
with tele medicine and all
of the different things

280
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,300
that will come about because of COVID.

281
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,579
But to be there on that forefront

282
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,522
and to help a company
like ours is tremendous.

283
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:22,433
- And security's often in the background,

284
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,030
at least I've felt it myself.

285
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,100
You show up at a place and it's bad news.

286
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,689
It's like, hey guys, let me tell you

287
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,902
about this event that we found,

288
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:37,000
or this interesting nation
state, it's in here.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,060
But this seems like one
of those opportunities

290
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,100
where security can really shine

291
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,050
and a team that's been very
dedicated for a long time

292
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,633
really gets recognition for
what they bring to the business.

293
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,313
- Correct.

294
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:58,313
And one of the very important
things here is that as a CISO,

295
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:02,240
it's not my job to scare
the board of directors.

296
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,770
It is my job to inform,

297
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,129
- It's a hobby, hobby more than

298
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,260
- Yeah, well no, but I mean, it's hey,

299
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,129
they invested, the company's
invested in a company

300
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,350
in the security of J&J and
to then be able to know

301
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,480
that we have the capabilities we need

302
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,960
and having worked with industry groups,

303
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,600
in government groups,

304
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,879
knowing you have the right connections

305
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,320
and you can call up the
head of CISA and say,

306
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,360
hey, I think we're going
to need to talk here.

307
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,159
And then working with
Operation Warp Speed,

308
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,330
it really is that partnership
with our private sector

309
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,409
and our public sector around the world

310
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,990
to be able to secure the cyberspace.

311
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,583
That's important for a CISO.

312
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,740
- And last question for you, Marene.

313
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,690
You're talking to the whole
community of RSA Conference.

314
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,240
Obviously this is a different year,

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,853
we're doing it all virtually.

316
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,300
What's the one piece of
advice that you'd give folks

317
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,687
from what you've learned
over the last 18 months.

318
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,030
- I probably have about six things

319
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,770
but I think the one
thing I will pull out is

320
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,770
that CISOs are in the role for a reason.

321
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,090
We're operational minded,
we need to be intel minded,

322
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,320
we need to be technical minded

323
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,530
but bringing it all together.

324
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,163
Being a CISO is not for
the faint of heart, Hugh.

325
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,687
- Well said, well said.

326
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,209
Marene, thanks for everything you do.

327
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,210
Not just for J&J but for
the community at large.

328
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,209
And I really, really appreciate it.

329
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,231
Thanks for being a part of this.

330
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,154
- All right, thank you Hugh.

331
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,737
(upbeat music)

332
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,473
Hey Phil, how are you?

333
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:13,460
- Good to see you again.

334
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,630
- You too, you too, thanks so
much for being a part of this.

335
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,210
- Always a pleasure.

336
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,880
- So I've got to ask,

337
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,810
I mean, an unbelievable
tenured Goldman Sachs,

338
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,090
probably one of the most respected

339
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,959
chief security officers on the planet.

340
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Now you find yourself at Google Cloud.

341
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,450
What are you focused on?

342
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,870
What's the thing, that's the biggest area

343
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,543
of interest for you today?

344
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,850
- Well, it's interesting

345
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,080
'cause one of the reasons
I was attracted to

346
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,689
now, to be fair, I
really focused on Google

347
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,200
but you could say the same
thing about any cloud provider

348
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,720
but I'm especially focused
obviously on Google Cloud,

349
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,910
is the potential for the cloud providers

350
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,380
given the nature

351
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,170
of how they support an increasing amount

352
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,870
of all of our organizations
to be the place

353
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,209
where we continue to transform security.

354
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,030
And so within that context,
I've focused heavily

355
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,790
and continue to focus heavily
on a number of things.

356
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,370
The first one I focus a lot
on is what we talk about

357
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,233
as usable security.

358
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,190
And then also thinking

359
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,770
about how do we improve the productivity

360
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,920
of the cybersecurity workforce out there

361
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,830
through improved tools.

362
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,980
And then another theme
I'm heavily focused is

363
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,370
what we call raising the baseline

364
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,667
by reducing the cost of control.

365
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:47,159
And I think together that usable security,

366
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,800
productivity improvements
and raising the baseline

367
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,790
by reducing the unit cost of control,

368
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,120
I think the cloud providers
and the economy of scale

369
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,570
that we provide for customers can actually

370
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,960
in the future be a pretty
significant contributor

371
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,660
to the transformation of security.

372
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,910
- I love how you put that

373
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,160
because it's such an
incredible opportunity for us

374
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,070
as we're moving so many
resources to the cloud.

375
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,560
I think a lot of people
have been accelerated

376
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,879
in that journey with COVID for sure.

377
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,350
And what you talked about is
really to me is the holy grail

378
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,850
of security, right?

379
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,850
For a long time, we've
struggled with this property,

380
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,720
I'd say of security that
if somebody told you,

381
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,060
they were going to make
a process more secure,

382
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,129
they just assumed it would feel worse.

383
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,130
It would be less usable,
more painful, slower

384
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,379
and this melding of,
can I get it done faster

385
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,000
and better as well as more secure,

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,060
I think is the only path forward.

387
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,340
So tell me, what are you
thinking about there?

388
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,189
Like what kind of work are you doing,

389
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,650
what kind of research?

390
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,690
- Well, it's funny, you
make that point that,

391
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,980
and I've heard that trope
you kind of quote a long time

392
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,381
which is kind of security
and usability are at odds

393
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:16,214
with each other.

394
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:20,780
And I think if security
is at odds with usability,

395
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,170
then it's probably not that good security.

396
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,570
And so I kind of find of fascinating

397
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,229
about the usable security
space is you think

398
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:33,000
about it across our lives
in general and our use

399
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,340
of lots of technology,
investments in user experience,

400
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,629
design and systems thinking
and kind of many areas of life,

401
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,700
have yet to be really fully
reflected in security.

402
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,370
And this is again, not just
for customers and consumers

403
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,729
of our products, but our
employees, our internal users,

404
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,760
our software developers and engineers.

405
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,629
You think about all of the
opportunities to improve customer

406
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,050
and employee and engineer
experience with tools that we use

407
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,909
in everyday life, as well as
the tools and development tools

408
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,090
and the IT management
tools that we use inside

409
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,350
of our enterprises.

410
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,469
And there's no reason

411
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,660
why those things can't
be significantly improved

412
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,190
from a usability perspective.

413
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,550
And so, for example, in our organization,

414
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,159
we have large numbers of user
experience teams that work

415
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,320
on everything from our
consumer facing technology,

416
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,899
whether it's the browser or
the other consumer experiences

417
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,780
but in particular as well,

418
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,070
we have a very large user experience team

419
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,439
and our security products
area that looks carefully

420
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,730
across what the expected user journeys are

421
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,630
through our products to make sure

422
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,530
that the right security
settings are the ones

423
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,899
that make most intuitive sense.

424
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,930
That the output from the
tools make intuitive sense,

425
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,660
so that we're not loading
people up with kind of fatigue

426
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,640
of dealing with too much
information when they have

427
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,790
to be looking at things.

428
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,780
And I think that the great thing

429
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,850
about this user experience
work is it delivers also

430
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,080
on the promise that security
isn't, good security is not

431
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
just about mitigating risk.

432
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,490
It's about providing adjacent
business benefits as well,

433
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,560
whether it's reducing customer
friction in signup processes,

434
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,310
reducing the number of false positives

435
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,810
that could be annoying, alerts in fraud

436
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,889
and anomaly detection systems.

437
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,820
And again, that doesn't
necessarily just have

438
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,100
to be tuning other product.

439
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,750
It could be the experience in
which the alert is delivered,

440
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,200
could make you more tolerant

441
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,330
of some increased level of intrusion.

442
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,610
And again, you think about that

443
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,959
in the rest of your
experience with products.

444
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,030
You see the benefit of
user experience, UX design.

445
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,970
I see a lot of companies
investing in this in security

446
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,370
and I think it's about time.

447
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,870
- I couldn't have put it
better, it's a bad time.

448
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,550
And like you said, it is incredible

449
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,340
because for a long period of time, I think

450
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,459
in the security industry
we were focused on,

451
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,060
hey, look, let's educate
all of our constituents.

452
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,290
Let's educate every user
internally and externally

453
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,190
about the threats and
expect my dad basically

454
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,710
to understand what a bad certificate is

455
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,760
and have them act accordingly

456
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,350
instead of fundamentally
baking it into the design.

457
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,360
So he just behaves like he naturally would

458
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,773
and to optimize his own utility.

459
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:37,080
And yeah, I agree with
you, this is a new era.

460
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,397
- But it's interesting as well.

461
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,919
And this is why it plays
into workforce productivity

462
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,753
as well.

463
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:44,750
And so like, like I'm
always keen to distinguish

464
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,230
between there's the user
experience of the users

465
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,240
of our products and then
there's the user experience

466
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,080
of our cybersecurity
workforce in using the tools

467
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,939
that we give them and
our software engineers

468
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,410
and infrastructure engineers

469
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,270
and other parts of the IT workforce,

470
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,918
are also impacted by usability.

471
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,752
I think it's interesting.

472
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,770
We talk a lot as an industry correctly

473
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,670
that we have a cybersecurity
skills challenge

474
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,300
where we need more cybersecurity people,

475
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,030
but we talk less about perhaps

476
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,740
what we should also be focused
on is 10Xing the productivity

477
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,400
of the cybersecurity professionals

478
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,102
we've already got through
radical improvements

479
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:28,590
in the tooling we give
them to do their job.

480
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,050
And a large part of that is
the usability, the design

481
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,740
and the integration of those tool sets.

482
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,500
I think a big part of what we can all do

483
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,350
and the industry can do better is just in,

484
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,560
not even just incrementally,

485
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,090
literally 10Xing the
productivity of our workforce

486
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,590
through improvements in tools.

487
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,795
- That would be transformative.

488
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,070
And Phil, I wish you best
of luck on this journey.

489
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,020
There's nobody better
suited to live it than you.

490
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,200
So thanks so much for that
and thanks for joining us.

491
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,428
- Yeah, thank you.

492
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,510
It's a pleasure, I'm looking
forward to seeing you all

493
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,510
in person at some future events.

494
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,893
- Me too, me too.

495
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:10,070
(upbeat music)

496
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,822
Hi Lakshmi, thanks so much for joining.

497
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:30,880
- Hey, Hugh, it's great to be here.

498
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,713
Thank you.

499
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,380
You remember the coffee
we had at RSA last year,

500
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,160
when did we think that last
year's event would be a marker

501
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,140
for all of us in cybersecurity?

502
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,710
We've missed these kinds of discussions.

503
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,113
- Oh, we do, I couldn't
agree with you more.

504
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:50,270
And you know, it's interesting
reflecting on this theme

505
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,830
of resilience that we have
for this year's conference.

506
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,770
We picked a break COVID
and who would have known,

507
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,520
how many different dimensions

508
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,889
of the word resilience
we've all had to live

509
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,523
through over these past 14 months?

510
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,763
- That's right.

511
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:10,800
I mean, it was tremendous foresight

512
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
but resilience sort of
weaves into a number of areas

513
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,460
where we're focused on.

514
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,460
If we start with people,
resilience is about leading

515
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,300
and operating with empathy
and we all have a number

516
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,840
of distractions from the work from home

517
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,470
or work from anywhere environment.

518
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,790
And it's also about
honoring those distractions

519
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,913
and making them part of the
DNA with which we operate.

520
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,750
- I love that perspective.

521
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,540
And you're right, I can't
even tell you how many

522
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,129
of these meetings that I've had where,

523
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,950
it's probably my own child
or an animal that's coming

524
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,350
into the room and at the
beginning it was awkward

525
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,783
but then for me, I really enjoyed it.

526
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,000
It created almost a bond,

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,770
it felt with the person on the other side.

528
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,400
So I love that word empathy.

529
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,070
- And that was also tethered to reality.

530
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,290
Well that is a reality we have with kids

531
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,690
or other distractions in
the environment coming into

532
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,100
what we would think is a
fairly resilient environment

533
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,280
in which we're operating.

534
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,750
So the other part of resilience is

535
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,010
for organizations themselves.

536
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,780
More broadly speaking, as we
see companies are starting

537
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,379
to dust off from the pandemic

538
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,510
and move from crisis
mode to strategic mode.

539
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,240
And what this means is that
they are recognizing changes

540
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,280
and shifts to boundaries of trust

541
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,330
and how they have to enable
new ways to work securely

542
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,360
with digital first experiences
across every interaction.

543
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,629
Do you see that as well?

544
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:02,556
- Absolutely, and I think
you framed it up great.

545
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:07,556
It is this idea that we
have to think about digital

546
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,070
as the first port of call.

547
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,868
And we've all been experiencing this.

548
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:18,620
I love how you put it, it
does feel like we've been

549
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,040
in crisis mode and scramble mode.

550
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,623
How do you think we go from here?

551
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,270
Like what's next after this?

552
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,449
We've been living a
crisis but it also feels

553
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,030
like there's an opportunity.

554
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,379
- It is an opportunity.

555
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,380
And I think the opportunity
is what are the tailwinds

556
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,629
that these opportunity provides
to us with hybrid work,

557
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,650
digital security experiences

558
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,520
and the legacy approaches
and the opportunity

559
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,460
for data security and
collaboration and all of that

560
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,280
to be needing an approach
that is going to work

561
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,740
in a hybrid environment.

562
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,910
So when we asked, when we
pause and ask the questions,

563
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,800
there are many layers that are integrated

564
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
into the ecosystem in which we operate.

565
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,240
What does shift into next look
like and how best we do it?

566
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,370
I think some thoughts that come

567
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,320
to my mind is one, is going
back to the empathy that,

568
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,149
leading with empathy, you're
operating with empathy,

569
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,450
it's here understand,
contribute but build and work

570
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,080
with the communities which we support.

571
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,790
The second aspect is

572
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,120
how do we build public
and private partnerships,

573
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,250
public and private
engagements to understand

574
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,930
what that acceleration into
a shift into next could be.

575
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,300
And I think that's very
powerful and the pause

576
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,530
that the pandemic has given
to us has helped to realize

577
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,250
that now more than ever,

578
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,550
public private partnerships are important.

579
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,453
And the third I would say is,

580
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,450
bench strength and muscle memory

581
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,253
such threat-informed defense
or supply chain resiliency.

582
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,040
If we need to put the spotlight
on shared responsibility

583
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,300
and the values of corporate citizenship.

584
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,230
So if we think about it in that way,

585
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,650
the three things that
we lead with empathy,

586
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,540
we are building with
threat-informed defense

587
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,550
and supply chain resiliency
and we're thinking

588
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,930
about the layered ecosystem
in which we operate.

589
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,830
I think we're gonna be in a great position

590
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,413
to shift into whatever is next.

591
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,330
- I love that sentiment and
Lakshmi, thank you so much

592
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,120
for sharing that with us.

593
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,300
And I couldn't agree more,
it's so great to see it.

594
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,230
I can't wait to see you
for real coffee next year.

595
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,063
- Likewise.

596
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,422
Thank you, Hugh.

597
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:55,089
(upbeat music)

598
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,549
- Hey, Darren, great to see you.

599
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,600
- G'day Hugh, how are you?

600
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,500
- Great, great.

601
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,360
And thanks so much for
being a part of this.

602
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,710
- Well, very humbled and very
honored to be here, Hugh,

603
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,260
and happy to help.

604
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,100
- Oh my gosh.

605
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,850
You know, jeez, I think back
to the very first time we met

606
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,330
which is a long time ago now.

607
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,330
And you have, in my
view, helped to redefine

608
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,192
what a chief security officer is.

609
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,469
You're the first person that talked to me

610
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,469
about physical, needs to be
in the same domain as cyber.

611
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,850
And I've got to ask you,

612
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,630
this has been such a crazy
crazy year with COVID.

613
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,180
You're the chief security officer

614
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,180
of the National Broadband
Network of Australia.

615
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,560
What did you think when you
heard the news of COVID-19,

616
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,029
it's out there, it's spreading.

617
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:18,030
Everything is going to
be remote and digital

618
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,100
and effectively run through your backbone.

619
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,153
I can't even imagine.

620
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,770
- There was some reflection
looking back now,

621
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,330
it's now over 14 months
since the March date

622
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,130
where we were informed that it was going

623
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,320
to be a really significant impact

624
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,940
on both Australian community
and our entire economy.

625
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,230
Particularly here in Victoria,

626
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,010
so Melbourne, Victoria was
in significant lockdown

627
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,110
for a large part of the year.

628
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,440
One of the reflections I have was

629
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,710
that the importance of
their role in this industry

630
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,023
in supporting the
organization or enterprise.

631
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:56,950
I was asked to step up

632
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,850
and chair our crisis management response.

633
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,020
So effectively chaired the ExCo

634
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,880
who managed the COVID response

635
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,470
for the National Broadband Network

636
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,770
and at that time we
were rounding to around

637
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,820
about six and a half to 7 million homes.

638
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,900
So a large part of the
economy was actually told,

639
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,120
grab a laptop, if you can take
a screen, hit home log on.

640
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,880
And they'd largely did
that utilizing the NBN.

641
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,480
So I actually felt the pressure.

642
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,850
- Gosh, that's amazing.

643
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:29,700
- Yeah, I think what we need
to do now in the industry, Hugh

644
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,259
is understand that

645
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,170
what we do for a living
has absolutely prepared us

646
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,520
to be significant players in
any major incident response.

647
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,560
And hopefully we'll get a chance

648
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,110
to talk a little bit more about that.

649
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,330
My three top takeaways from the COVID,

650
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,759
from the last 13, 14 months is absolutely

651
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,540
that criticality of connectivity.

652
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,830
It wasn't road and rail here in Australia

653
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,400
that saved us the last 13 or 14 months.

654
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,300
It was actually the
broadband and connectivity

655
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,960
to allow this economy
to continue to function.

656
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,900
The second was our absolute
reliance, not on technology,

657
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,900
but on the ethicacy of people
and the ability for people

658
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,150
to adapt and never actually
lose sight of the fact

659
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,600
that people are always the first mission.

660
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,860
And then finally, from a
more personal viewpoint,

661
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,110
I think our role in our industry is going

662
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,050
to have the morph you

663
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:30,050
from what we see today,
which is really a identity,

664
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,480
prevention detection
role to more of response

665
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,660
and sort of recovery
business continuity function.

666
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,680
And I see that starting
to move a lot more quicker

667
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,879
than I thought it would.

668
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,740
- And it's gotta be incredible
sitting in that role,

669
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,320
leading the crisis response effectively

670
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,320
across the organization and
seeing the kinds of resources

671
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,830
that you have to truly muster
to get business continuity

672
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,590
to happen in practice.

673
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,580
We all talk about business continuity,

674
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,340
but it's a very different
thing when you have

675
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,470
to actually lead it in a time of crisis.

676
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,089
How do you think then this role

677
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,390
of the chief security
officer is going to change?

678
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,833
How should it change?

679
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,360
- Very much in aha moments for me

680
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,003
during this period that we speak of, Hugh.

681
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,383
I believe that the role of
the chief security officer,

682
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:36,899
or the chief information
security officer will develop

683
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,710
and grow into what you might want

684
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,573
to call the chief trust officer.

685
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,150
The ability to provide
secure and reliable broadband

686
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,040
in my point, or any product
or service that we speak of,

687
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,040
the security industry, reliability
and security is critical.

688
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,600
And if you put those two
things together, it's trust.

689
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,330
You have to trust the provider

690
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,540
and the service being provided.

691
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,400
And we are the custodian of that trust.

692
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,450
So I actually see the role of
the security person morphing

693
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,020
to actually not only the
security of the capability

694
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,080
or product of it but also the reliability

695
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,250
of the same product or service,.

696
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,680
Therefore security and
reliability combined is trust.

697
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,509
People trust that
organization or the service

698
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,310
or product it provides.

699
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,230
And we are the custodians of that.

700
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,480
We are today, but we
are now seeing it morph

701
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,010
into more the reliability
and or business continuity.

702
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,850
So I absolutely see that that
will be a focus going forward

703
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,700
for the industry.

704
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:46,490
- And I love the way you put
it because trust is such a,

705
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,009
it's such a powerful word.

706
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,720
It's an abstract word,
but at the same time

707
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,500
to trust something

708
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,450
you have to be able to rely on it.

709
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,129
You have to be able to know
that it's secure and safe.

710
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,530
You have to be able to know
that you can depend on it.

711
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,690
And then muster the resources to do that,

712
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,690
is a very different thinking

713
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,820
about the chief security officer.

714
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,713
I love that.

715
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,790
- And Hugh, as an extension of that,

716
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,690
we didn't stop actually going
to our C-suite, Ex-co or board

717
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,210
and saying, please give us more money,

718
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,170
we need to secure the organization.

719
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,200
What we do say is that,

720
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,359
if this is a more trusted organization

721
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,890
because it's more
reliable and more secure,

722
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,480
it is a competitive advantage.

723
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,770
The trust will actually increase revenue

724
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,570
because people believe in the product.

725
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,050
So we actually flip this
whole dichotomy we've got

726
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,700
at the moment by actually
constantly pleading for more money

727
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,069
to lock down the organization

728
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,470
and make it more secure if you like.

729
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,720
To actually saying, if you
actually supply more resources

730
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,959
and more capability,

731
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,510
we will make this a more
trusted organization.

732
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,210
And therefore we will increase patronage,

733
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,817
we will increase growth,
we will increase revenue

734
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,240
- Darren, thanks so much
for what you've done at NBN

735
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,263
and really what you've
done for the industry.

736
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,200
It's so great to have you here

737
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,210
and just get your perspective.

738
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,763
Really, really appreciate it.

739
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,673
- Thanks, Hugh.

740
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:23,609
And congratulations on all you've achieved

741
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,107
with the RSA Conference.

742
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,900
And as I said, when we
caught up, I'm really pleased

743
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,030
that you've continued
to actually go forward

744
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,000
with the virtual conference this year.

745
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,430
It's a large part of the
connection of the industry globally

746
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,690
and we play such an important role.

747
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,420
And this is the issue I do
say is, that trust, security,

748
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,350
reliability are now senior
business operational risks,

749
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,069
any enterprise, government
department faces,

750
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,260
and to have us in an industry globally,

751
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,670
where we can reach out to folks like you,

752
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,170
is really important for
us down here in Australia.

753
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,310
- Thanks so much for saying so, and jeez,

754
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,330
I've always, always
appreciated your insights

755
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,279
and just the partnership.

756
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,520
So Darren, thanks so much.

757
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,280
I really appreciate it.

758
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,100
And I hope to see you in person soon.

759
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,830
- You look very much the same, Hugh.

760
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,020
Good luck with the conference

761
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,990
and all the best of all
my friends and companions

762
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,410
that I haven't caught up
with for 12, 14 months.

763
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,259
Thanks again, Hugh and good luck.

764
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,203
- Take care.

765
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:28,775
(upbeat music)

766
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,271
Hi, Reem.

767
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,883
Welcome, thanks so much
for being a part of this.

768
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,047
- Thank you so much, Hugh.

769
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:54,180
It's a true honor and a huge
privilege to be with you

770
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,339
in this keynote.

771
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,108
Thank you so much for this
one for the opportunity.

772
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:01,840
- Oh, it's so great to have you
and to get your perspective.

773
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,480
And when last you spoke at RSA Conference,

774
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,310
your title was chief
information security officer

775
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,870
of Kuwait Oil Company.

776
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,029
Now I understand that
that title has changed.

777
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,030
And I wanna ask you about that
later on in the discussion,

778
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,430
but it really feeds into this question

779
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,560
that we've been asking of so
many of the security leaders

780
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,712
around the world, which
is you're in this role,

781
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,100
you're responsible for
security, COVID hits.

782
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,450
It changes the world,
that changes your world,

783
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,549
that changes how people work.

784
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,000
Talk to me about what
that was like for you,

785
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,333
leading through that.

786
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,630
- Well, just bringing all
these difficult times for us

787
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,520
in the cybersecurity, 2020
was a year of survival.

788
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,520
It was about trying to
grasp what has changed

789
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:17,132
and very unprecedented accelerated
digital transformation,

790
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,570
the business was in shock.

791
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:24,520
We were there to defend
and enable the business.

792
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,520
We were the guardians that
has been tested in real time,

793
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,960
in difficult times for
these companies to survive.

794
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,760
So when you tell me, Reem
what 2020 stands for,

795
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,200
I would simply say it's
a year of survival.

796
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,439
But as we have evolved,

797
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,630
as we have learned through this year,

798
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,240
we became closer to each other.

799
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,180
We touched our team members
because we ourselves we went

800
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,569
to assist, and we went into
burnouts, lots of burnouts.

801
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,287
And we were so much careful
that we really don't want this

802
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,839
to be reflective of our team members.

803
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,760
So we became much closer,

804
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,053
we increased our check-in on each other.

805
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,430
We became more empathetic,
actually our empathetic side

806
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,430
evolved more and became more emphasized.

807
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:22,470
And during these difficult times

808
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,919
because human became vulnerable.

809
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,480
During this pandemic, what
became vulnerable is the human,

810
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,784
the human factor himself.

811
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:33,730
There were fears where the
vulnerability where attackers

812
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,023
and adversaries has utilized that,

813
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,744
initiating all of these phishing scams

814
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:41,990
and these attacks and
ransomwares everywhere.

815
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,970
So we wanted to strengthen the first line

816
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,750
of defense as the cybersecurity vendors.

817
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,300
And that was by enriching the people

818
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,640
and from that also we worked
on the process and technology

819
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,080
where you need to work on the
three, let's say pyramids,

820
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,890
the three pillars of that pyramid

821
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,520
in order for you to survive.

822
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Through the survival, we evolved,
we became very much aware

823
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,850
and adapt to this new norm.

824
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,799
We learned that cybersecurity is a culture

825
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,143
and it needs to be reflected everywhere.

826
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:21,250
And from that Hugh, we
have become very much,

827
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,133
walking the talk and Hugh, I
would like shed some light.

828
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:35,724
And I would like to shed some
light on that new part of,

829
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,453
actually the pandemic itself
has prepared me for that one.

830
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:44,580
I wasn't aware that this
where the phase we've taken,

831
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,029
but sometimes our roads is
being very much planned.

832
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,290
And we are putting on tracks

833
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,270
where we eventually reach
the destiny well prepared

834
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,600
and ready for the new adventure.

835
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,610
And this is what really
2020 has made me feel.

836
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,430
We have seen very closely
what digital transformation is

837
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,540
and how crucial it is

838
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:10,540
to embed these cybersecurity
culture, controls,

839
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,500
measures effectively and efficiently.

840
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,090
It's not about an audit,
it's not about compliance.

841
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,800
It's about weaving the
cybersecurity into this technology

842
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,250
and making your digital
transformation journey,

843
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,980
very very much secure.

844
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,900
And this is what we
have done very closely.

845
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,370
And we became putting the two hats

846
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,470
of a cyber security defender

847
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,620
as well as the business enabler.

848
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,390
And we started building that partnership

849
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,049
between the cybersecurity
and the business.

850
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,130
And you start to strengthen
that trust relationship

851
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,260
between each others.

852
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,614
- And I can only imagine,

853
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:52,310
this is such a crucial
time for leadership.

854
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,840
You've got the company that's
obviously now having to work

855
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,370
in a different way.

856
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,490
They're adapting to a situation

857
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,500
that's changing all the time.

858
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,320
Reem, I love something
that you said before,

859
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,320
which is, our experiences
of the past really shape us

860
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,339
for what's to come, no
matter what that is.

861
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,020
And what you were talking about,

862
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,600
about the interweaving of security

863
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,600
and digital transformation
being inextricable.

864
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,479
I couldn't agree with you more

865
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,593
and I'm, wonder how has
that played out there?

866
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,410
- Actually weaving is
what I have witnessed

867
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,410
through this recent period
because Hugh, it's very critical.

868
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,500
We're looking into a new digital era

869
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,740
and going there without our yields

870
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,620
of cybersecurity being addressed very well

871
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,920
and having all the cybersecurity
controls implemented

872
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,050
with being very much
aware of all the risks

873
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,663
and being properly mitigated.

874
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,870
We won't be there to survive another year.

875
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,980
Really 2021, it's a year of survival,

876
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,040
it's a year of resilience.

877
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,009
It's a year of leaning towards
the promise of excellence

878
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,860
and agility.

879
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,040
We all know, and it's never
about, will we be attacked?

880
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,990
It's just about when.

881
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,410
So without being resilient enough,

882
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:29,297
without being agile enough
with our digital system,

883
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:30,750
with our digital transformation

884
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:34,370
we wont to be able to
actually survive anymore.

885
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,920
So knowing that fact and being aware

886
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,540
that we need really to
get cybersecurity involved

887
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,770
in stage zero and weave into
our digital transformation,

888
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,473
this is where actually
our success factor is.

889
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:52,720
Our leadership of course
in our company have seen

890
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,430
that with this accelerated
and unprecedented effort

891
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:01,279
towards digital transformation
in a very unprecedented,

892
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,280
let's say manner, where even
technology has been emerging,

893
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,830
disruptive technologies has been emerging

894
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:13,830
and energy sector, that
was always conservative,

895
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,350
is now becoming a more
open towards thriving

896
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,620
and towards embracing these
disruptive technologies

897
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,540
just for the sake of, we need to get

898
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,840
to that performance excellence,
we need to be able to get

899
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,840
towards that operation
effectiveness and efficiency.

900
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,600
So they can't be there

901
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,130
without having that
proper and secure journey.

902
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,820
And that can't be done

903
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,720
without the cybersecurity
becoming the best ally

904
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,180
of that digital transformation.

905
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,890
So today my leadership
has trusted in me leading

906
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,049
that digital transformation journey

907
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,050
where I live and breathe
and work the manners

908
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,890
of a cybersecurity officer

909
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,040
and also I've been putting the hat

910
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,730
of the business enabler in the
past period during the 2020

911
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,580
where we were the partners
side to side with the business,

912
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,630
enabling that business today
and shifting to that role,

913
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,210
putting cybersecurity
right front and center,

914
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,600
becoming the cybersecurity biggest ally,

915
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,310
most strongest ally,

916
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,270
where I am leading this digital
transformation journeys.

917
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,880
Huge and let's say elaborately

918
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,830
on different manners within the company,

919
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,093
with that CISO hat, you know.

920
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,620
This couldn't become
even a better opportunity

921
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,113
for the whole cybersecurity,

922
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,420
let's say within my
company than to have me,

923
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:51,420
their CISO earlier,
leading this transformation

924
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,919
and enforcing, if not embracing,

925
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,920
these cybersecurity controls,
culture, even my team

926
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
and that now I'm leaving,

927
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,133
I'm telling them,

928
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:07,640
all of you are becoming
the cybersecurity champions

929
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,980
and you're just an extended family

930
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,340
of the cybersecurity
team within my company.

931
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,760
Because all of us developing,

932
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,520
ensuring that these developments are going

933
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,520
through secure development
cycles with these embracing,

934
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,600
the culture of being a
cyber-aware organization.

935
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,589
We are reflecting a new era of evolution

936
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,780
where cybersecurity is
now walking the talk

937
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,120
of becoming the business
enabler and action,

938
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,230
not just an ISO or
quality or certifications,

939
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,400
we're now becoming a live evidence

940
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,470
that cybersecurity are the enablers

941
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,803
of these new digital
eras of these journeys.

942
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,299
- What a fantastic thing for our industry.

943
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,850
I mean, I love the way
that you described it.

944
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:02,759
It's transformation
with the heart of a CISO

945
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,470
and as a CISO being the
enabler of the business.

946
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,839
And congratulations by the way,

947
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,670
in your new role as digital
transformation leader.

948
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,940
That's fantastic.

949
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,960
I mean, Kuwait Oil Company is one

950
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,177
of the most important companies

951
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:25,550
and one of the most important
sectors in the world.

952
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:29,420
And for the leadership there to recognize

953
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,420
how fundamental security
is to the future thriving

954
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,630
of the entire business is fantastic.

955
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,310
I think it's a great thing for all of us.

956
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,920
And Reem I can't thank you
enough for being a part of this.

957
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,070
It's so great talking to you.

958
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,810
I feel like I learn something every time

959
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:55,810
and such, I'd say an inspiring message

960
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,113
to the whole community.

961
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,240
- Thank you so much, Hugh.

962
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,959
It's really wonderful to
share this experience,

963
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,060
to share these insights.

964
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,810
I hope they are insightful
to our community

965
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,960
which I'm so proud of being part of

966
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,230
and will always be a part of
in my heart and in my mind.

967
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,310
Thank you so much Hugh
for this wonderful chat.

968
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,240
Thank you.

969
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,073
- Thanks Reem.

970
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,700
(upbeat music)

971
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,149
Thanks so much for being
a part of this session.

972
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,033
And thanks to our amazing,
amazing group of guests.

973
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:43,100
I mean, jeez, the kinds of
things that I've learned

974
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,500
just from these conversations

975
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,610
about how folks are
thinking about the future,

976
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:54,010
how they're recalibrating
their own security strategy,

977
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:59,010
how they're focusing on the
people aspect of what we do.

978
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,330
It's been such, I'd
say a challenging time,

979
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,009
for so many of us in the security space.

980
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,350
And I view RSA Conference

981
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,860
as the place that we can come together

982
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,860
and really not just share
ideas, but build each other up.

983
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,330
So I thank you so much for
joining us for this session

984
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,493
and have a great rest of the conference.

985
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:29,408
