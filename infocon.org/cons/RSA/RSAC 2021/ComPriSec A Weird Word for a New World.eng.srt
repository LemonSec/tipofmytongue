1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,463
- Welcome the C-suite
view session CXO W-10.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,120
ComPriSec: A weird Word for a New World.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm Ron Warner with Bellevue university

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,099
and president of Cyber-AAA.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,500
With me is an esteemed panel
of experts in compliance,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,110
security and privacy.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,750
Because that's what ComPriSec means.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,270
It's just the combination of these roles

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,080
within an organization.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,009
How many of you are in
that position right now,

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,230
or you see it or you're experiencing it

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,750
or you see that conflict

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,970
between compliance, security and privacy?

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,960
We'll talk with our
panelists today to come

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,650
up with solutions for you as you're

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,660
in a ComPriSec world

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,209
With me today is Lisa
McKee, from Protiviti,

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,320
Robert LaMagna Reiter

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,460
from First National Technology solutions

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,490
and Warren Fish also from Protiviti.

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,653
Welcome panel.

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,123
- Hi Ron.

23
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:00,140
Thanks. Glad to be here

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,510
- Lisa, you developed the
word ComPriSec a few years ago

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,960
because you have experienced
this and seen this.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,259
So first of all, please
introduce yourself.

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,450
Tell a little bit about
who you are and then maybe

28
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,805
if you can explain how you
developed this word ComPriSec

29
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:20,100
and then I'll have the
panelists do the same thing.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
- Great. Thanks Ron.

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,820
And thanks to RSA and
all the attendees today.

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,479
We're so excited to have
you join this session.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,560
My experience, I've been
in technology for 20 years.

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,090
I started off as a developer

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,900
but the last 12 years have
been in security compliance

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,920
privacy audit, all things in that area.

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,190
So I came up with the word
and the idea of ComPriSec

38
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,420
because I found myself in
this role where I was creating

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,640
and leading the compliance department.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,460
And as part of compliance, I
said, well, what about privacy?

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,149
We should, we're an international company,

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,190
we should be complying with
privacy regulations as well.

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,640
And they said, "Great, you
get compliance and privacy!"

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,490
And so I found myself in this role

45
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,190
where now I'm juggling
compliance requirements,

46
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,009
privacy requirements, and I'm
also a security and IT person.

47
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,410
So I was also tasked with
finding the technology

48
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,230
and security regulations
for privacy and compliance.

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,700
In that I found that many
of my colleagues were coming

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,560
to me and seeing me as the
industry expert in the company

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,010
for security, as well as
compliance and privacy.

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,549
And I found myself
juggling these three roles

53
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,070
and the challenges that came with

54
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,489
how do you have the balance?

55
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,950
How do you have the segregation

56
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,910
of duties and how do you make sure

57
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,320
that you're not fulfilling
all three of those roles

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,400
even though it may seem like you are.

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,493
So that's where the idea came from.

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,360
- Rob. If you could maybe give
your perspective of ComPriSec

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,923
as you introduce yourself
and your role in security.

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,663
- Hello, everyone.

63
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:56,400
It's a pleasure to be on the panel today.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,670
And thank you for joining us.

65
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,200
My name is Robert LaMagna-Reiter.

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,442
I'm the Chief Information
Security officer at FNTS.

67
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,910
It's a managed services organization.

68
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,910
So I have the privilege
of not only running a team

69
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,029
of experts that are
responsible for security,

70
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,340
some compliance, and some
privacy for our organization,

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,910
but we also work with hundreds

72
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,799
of other organizations on
several industry verticals.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,310
And so the complexities

74
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,913
of compliance and privacy are compounded.

75
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,810
I've just a little over
16 years of experience.

76
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,360
I started off in security engineering

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,160
and throughout my career
have been hands-on

78
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,720
as an auditor, have been
hands-on as engineer, you know,

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,650
blend of several roles

80
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,570
throughout the career of
security risk management.

81
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,670
And in my current role, have also taken

82
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,459
on some of the privacy in addition

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,070
to (indistinct) compliance.

84
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,670
I think that that the
biggest thing that can help

85
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,119
in part today is, how to prioritize

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,377
and stay focused and
focus on what can work

87
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:05,040
from a single strategy
standpoint to help alleviate

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,730
the attention being torn between the three

89
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,810
and expected to be the
expert to speak on all

90
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,783
even though you're probably
only in one defined role.

91
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,149
- Awesome, Robert.
Warren, introduce yourself

92
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,373
and explain how compliance
fits within ComPriSec.

93
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,780
- Hi, good afternoon.

94
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,929
My name is Warren Fish
and I work for Protiviti.

95
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,510
I'm in the information
security and strategy practice.

96
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm a Navy veteran.

97
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,940
I have 20 years of experience working

98
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,140
in the military industrial complex.

99
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,620
So I've been in many roles at department

100
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,030
of defense employee, a defense
contractor, a lobbyist,

101
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,609
and I used to work at United
States strategic command

102
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,410
in their joint cyber center.

103
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,390
So I also have an auditing
background as well as you know

104
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,820
kind of an inspector general.

105
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,270
If you're familiar with
the Department of Defense,

106
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,469
I spent a lot of time
helping clients on NIST

107
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,190
Cybersecurity Framework oriented issues.

108
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,450
So having said that,

109
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,890
I'm gonna spend a little
bit of time trying

110
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,659
to convince you that
compliance is more important

111
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,940
than security and privacy.

112
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,113
And over to you, Ron.

113
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,303
- Very good.

114
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,420
So let's dive into the topic of today.

115
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,620
We have this new word, ComPriSec.

116
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,160
What we're talking about today is

117
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,340
how do we differentiate the roles

118
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,099
of compliance, privacy and security?

119
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,260
We'll go into how to manage
that type of conflict

120
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,969
whether you're one individual having all

121
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,940
of these hats or you have multiple roles

122
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,590
within a larger organization,
sometimes internal,

123
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,099
sometimes external.

124
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,210
We'll be providing you

125
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,650
with some solutions for
these challenges we're seeing

126
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,010
across the different
types of ComPriSec roles,

127
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,810
particularly as they have
maybe some competing authority

128
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,520
and some competing responsibilities.

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,419
So let's dive in with the first question.

130
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,840
And I'll start with you
Lisa, as our privacy expert,

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,489
how does ComPriSec, how
can be different depending

132
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,090
on your role within the organization?

133
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,890
From a privacy point of view,

134
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,020
maybe is privacy really the most important

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,270
of these because of all
the new regulations?

136
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,469
And it's kind of like

137
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,620
you're the Belle of
the ball at this point.

138
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,723
- Thanks Ron.

139
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:22,020
Yeah. So it does really
matter where you are in that

140
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,190
in that triad, right,
compliance, privacy or security.

141
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,500
Compliance is gonna be
looking at everything.

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,210
What should I be compliant with?

143
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,640
As Warren mentioned, there was a lot

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,890
of net national and industry standards.

145
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,669
So NIST, ISO, FFIC, you've
got your privacy regulations.

146
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,750
They're gonna be looking at everything.

147
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,370
What does the organization
needs to be compliant with?

148
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,680
Then the privacy perspective,

149
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,540
they're only gonna be focused
on the privacy requirements.

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,270
So maybe that's the EU, GDPR, CCPA

151
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,289
Virginia just passed a new one in March.

152
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,860
They have a new data privacy law.

153
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,830
That's what the privacy technology people

154
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,840
are gonna be looking for.

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,630
And security is gonna be
the systems and technologies

156
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,100
the software where that data is housed.

157
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,400
So that's the difference

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,030
between those three roles
and the perspectives

159
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,799
that each of those are
gonna be looking at.

160
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,320
And Rob, you mentioned
a security engineer.

161
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,219
What people may or may not realize,

162
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,140
is that there's also a
privacy engineering role.

163
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,280
And that privacy engineer is looking

164
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,150
at the technology and the engineering side

165
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,370
of how do we implement
these privacy controls.

166
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,040
- Rob, do you agree that
security is mainly focused just

167
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,700
on the technology aspects of this?

168
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,620
Or do you see security as
maybe having a broader role

169
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,453
within whether it's ComPriSec
or just within organizations?

170
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,150
- Yeah, I, think that
security is long thought of

171
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,417
as the systems and data security experts,

172
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:56,030
and the control experts, but in reality,

173
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,839
it's much larger than that.

174
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,280
I used to think early on in my career

175
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,820
that that's what we
were there to do, right?

176
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,300
But you fast forward after
understanding the ins

177
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,890
and outs of the business.

178
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,810
We're much more than that.

179
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,040
Security is made up of risk management

180
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,880
and risk mitigation professionals.

181
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,550
I say risk management
because we need to ensure

182
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,660
that the adequate controls

183
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,990
to protect data exposure are
managed cost effectively.

184
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,520
And if we can do that
better than our competition,

185
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,240
better than we did the year
before we're delivering cycles

186
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,020
and value back to the business

187
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,949
we also are managing our risk,

188
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,870
which is, you know, our loss
exposure objectives over time.

189
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,010
And so as a result,
security professionals had

190
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,110
to also become teachers,
educators, storytellers,

191
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,970
because we have to quantify and compare

192
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,610
that over time in order to
articulate why certain controls

193
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,450
are in place, you know,
why there aren't guardrails

194
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,620
around certain aspects of the business.

195
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,790
And by virtue of that

196
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,219
it requires every
(indistinct) of insecurity

197
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,230
to have some sort of an understanding

198
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,020
of several business unit components

199
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,210
Even an understanding of, you know,

200
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,870
the technology compliance

201
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,390
and privacy individuals
that they work with.

202
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,140
And so all of a sudden, you're much more

203
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,340
than a security professional.

204
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,440
Security might be, you know, more than 50%

205
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,440
of your time spent and that's
what your profession is,

206
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,860
But you are obligated to
understand enough of what you work

207
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,630
with your colleagues
to be, to be effective.

208
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,950
So I would argue security
probably is the most foundational

209
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,650
and most important of the three

210
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,530
in order to enable, not just the business

211
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,350
but a rock solid compliance
and privacy function.

212
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,340
- Warren, do you have a rebuttal for that?

213
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,980
Isn't often the driver compliance

214
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,980
and if an organization is fined
for not following the rules?

215
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,599
- Yeah. I think I'm most amused

216
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,996
that security, are storytellers,

217
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,622
That's a good one, Rob.
I liked that quite a bit.

218
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
Let's talk about what
compliance is not, right.

219
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,569
I'd like to take a little
fight out of my colleagues here

220
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,280
so they can't use these on me, right.

221
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,839
It doesn't mean, compliance doesn't mean

222
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,160
you're not gonna get hacked, right?

223
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,360
Certainly we've all had to see examples

224
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,320
of companies that were compliant
that got hacked, right?

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,000
It doesn't mean you have a secure network

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,060
and ultimately compliance
is not sexy, right?

227
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,099
The CEO is not gonna be talking

228
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,400
about compliance during
the quarterly sales call.

229
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,790
Unless you're not compliant, right?

230
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,740
So, oh, now we have a problem.

231
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,340
That's when I think compliance
is probably the reason

232
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,963
that my security and privacy peers exist.

233
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,810
- So compliance sometimes
has that hammer, if you will

234
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,000
to drive home security and privacy.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,390
But Lisa, you were talking about a lot

236
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,780
of the different new
privacy rules and laws.

237
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,390
So how does, and what are some examples

238
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,390
from the privacy realm of
bringing together ComPriSec?

239
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,199
And do you agree with what you heard

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,870
from Rob and Warren,
regarding where privacy fits?

241
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,013
Maybe it's just off to the
side, just done when necessary.

242
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,490
- So Warren, does it
think compliance is sexy

243
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,970
but I certainly think privacy is.

244
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,110
It's the new shiny thing
everyone's talking about lately.

245
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,130
It's been around for a while

246
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,490
but just the last five years or so,

247
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,250
it really heightened the conversation

248
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,010
with those new laws and regulations

249
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,500
especially starting in
the EU with the GDPR.

250
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,950
And so it's changing the conversation.

251
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,600
It's changing how we talk about security,

252
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,650
how we talk about compliance, because now

253
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,400
there's another player in the game.

254
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,490
And this does even come out and said

255
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,120
that now they view privacy as
an equal domain to security.

256
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,780
Some people see security
as a subset of, or sorry,

257
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,230
see privacy as a subset of security.

258
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,560
But that's actually not the case.

259
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,619
And when you've got a big
industry like NIST coming out

260
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,200
and saying that they're equal.

261
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,450
Yeah. I think we're the
new kids on the block

262
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,370
but we are the shiny sexy thing right now,

263
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,670
everybody's talking about.

264
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,110
- So Rob, how about some
examples from the security realm

265
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,930
of where you've held multiple
hats or experienced it,

266
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,349
maybe with some of your clients,

267
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,800
where they've had to
pull together compliance,

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,500
security and privacy?

269
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,930
How do we manage maybe the conflicts

270
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,680
between those types of roles?

271
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,780
And do you even agree with what Lisa said?

272
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,030
- There's a lot loaded there.

273
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,970
Ron, I'll do my best to break it

274
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,980
down piece by piece and
address all of the points.

275
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,220
So let's start off by calling out what

276
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,431
why security is so important,

277
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:43,080
not just in an individual role,

278
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,310
why it's important for the entire C-suite

279
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,109
to be in the know of of what the risks are

280
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,030
that we're mitigating.

281
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,620
And if you're in, again, like you said,

282
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,050
the managed services space,
or if you're consulting

283
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,750
like my peers in the panel
are for other customers,

284
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,030
we're here to stop data
breaches and stop data loss,

285
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,100
and or mitigated to the
point where it's acceptable

286
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,070
to the business, right?

287
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,903
And that's (indistinct)

288
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,343
the overall strategic
objective of cybersecurity.

289
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,658
In a lot of my early roles,
security was thought of

290
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:16,051
your perimeter defense,
your endpoint defense.

291
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,920
Your identity management
engineer, you know,

292
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,550
provisioning accounts, right?

293
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,099
It's so much more complicated than that.

294
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,470
You know, once you raise
yourself up a level

295
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,521
and understand how it intertwines

296
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:33,689
with the rest of the business,
and we're talking everything

297
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,580
from the data, the applications,
the assets, the services

298
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,470
and over the course of
time, security professionals

299
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,270
I think have bared the branch, right?

300
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,290
Do you more often than Nazi
has security professional

301
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,980
become that ComPriSec role from
compliance where it started.

302
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,320
It might've been a company
you needed to be prepping

303
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,850
for Sarbanes-Oxley or PCI DSS

304
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,930
or just an internal IT
general's control audit right?

305
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,099
Fast forward through
today, where security now

306
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,390
has to protect the data, wherever it goes

307
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,250
and support a lot of the objectives

308
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,420
and data requests, in
fact, evidence, gatherings.

309
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,510
And so I'm gonna fast
forward and throw out,

310
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,460
I think, in industry buzz word

311
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,265
that I know sparks both passion

312
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:22,278
and maybe some, you know, eyes rolling

313
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,970
from a lot of those that night
being attendance here today.

314
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,050
And that is that of zero trust.

315
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,859
And the reason why I'm such
a big believer and leader

316
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,350
of a zero trust strategy is
because that's what it is.

317
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,931
It's taking another approach.

318
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:38,450
Looking at the way we used to do things

319
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,870
like with legacy of security,
controls, and joint, you know

320
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,820
joining it together and trying
to bolt on different layers.

321
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,890
Look at the shortcomings of
failing legacy approaches

322
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,630
and remove the assumption
of trust altogether.

323
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,070
We don't want to make things more trusted.

324
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,570
We want to eliminate the concept

325
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,260
of trust from our digital
environments, so that

326
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,140
we can apply the right
data aligned controls to

327
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,370
make compliance and privacy easier

328
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,683
by a more efficient security operation.

329
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,870
- Warren, I saw you rolling your eyes when

330
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,100
Robert mentioned zero trust.

331
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,640
What are your thoughts about that?

332
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,300
From that compliance point of view?

333
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,180
- I don't know if I was rolling my eyes

334
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,989
but I was definitely gritting my teeth.

335
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,440
Okay. So I liked some
of the things he said

336
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,630
and then he kind of ruined it

337
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,630
by throwing zero trust there on the end.

338
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,250
Right? So the part that I liked,
he talked about, you know,

339
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,580
compliance means you have

340
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,660
to implement appropriate security measures

341
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,530
to protect your data, right?

342
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,100
I agree with that, obviously.

343
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,040
That's probably the smartest
thing I'm gonna say today.

344
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,780
We have to be implementing
appropriate security measures.

345
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,550
That word is so key to me,
that appropriate, right?

346
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,490
We don't want to spend
$2 to secure a $1 part.

347
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,320
It's in every every book I've ever read.

348
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
CISM books, CIS book, right?

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,740
It's gonna tell you not to do that,

350
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,050
but it's more important than
security or provider privacy,

351
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,760
because leadership only
wants to spend enough money

352
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,189
to be compliant.

353
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,630
They don't want to spend
extra money, right?

354
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,500
That's what everybody
really wants is compliance.

355
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,240
They want the auditors to go away.

356
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,570
But right now, everybody

357
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,290
in the audience is thinking,

358
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,579
Warren you're a checkbox auditor.

359
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,000
He doesn't know anything, right?

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,490
And, and you know what,

361
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,470
sometimes I am a checkbox auditor,

362
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,000
it kind of depends on who
I'm trying to support, right?

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,443
What does the organization want?

364
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:21,980
What do they want to be successful?

365
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,830
Right. But if I'm the
system of your organization

366
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,943
then compliance check
boxes are those minimums.

367
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,100
- Lisa, you have your own thoughts

368
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,060
about how privacy plays with zero trust.

369
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,489
What are those?

370
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,770
- Yeah. So I have the idea
of zero trust privacy.

371
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,430
And I've talked with Robin
extensively about this

372
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,709
of using the concepts

373
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,770
of zero trust to implement
your privacy solutions

374
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,030
in your controls.

375
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,430
So if you're eliminating
that trust between things,

376
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,260
there are concepts within
privacy that say, you know,

377
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
need to know and make sure

378
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,270
that you're not over
collecting of information.

379
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,760
And if you implement a zero
trust privacy solution,

380
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,650
or you know, to Warren's point,

381
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,520
let's get away from those
checkbook box audits,

382
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,550
let's implement a solid holistic security

383
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,690
and privacy solution that are
complimentary to each other.

384
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,480
I mean, NIST and ISO both
have complimentary security

385
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,609
and privacy frameworks.

386
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,839
So if you do that,

387
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,540
it helps get away from
that checkbox audit.

388
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,409
It helps ensure that you
have a solid program.

389
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,350
So you don't have to wait for
what's that next regulation

390
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,800
how am I gonna meet those
checkbox requirements?

391
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
Because your programs should already

392
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,690
be equipped to handle that.

393
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,360
- Yeah. And I'd like to
build on that if I may, Ron.

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,260
And we've seen NIST and
even the DoD advocate

395
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,930
for entities taking on more
of a zero trust approach.

396
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,550
And I want to be very clear of what I'm

397
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,605
what I'm talking about and
build on what Lisa talked about.

398
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,410
It's not a product, right?

399
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,530
We're not, I'm not advocating,

400
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,047
we're not advocating that folks go out

401
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,390
and buy something that's
branded as zero trust.

402
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,470
It really is just a strategy

403
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,580
in which we mean security controls

404
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,340
and visibility becoming ubiquitous

405
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,379
throughout an IT environment, right?

406
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,140
It's the model and the
strategy is designed

407
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,760
to be resonant at
throughout the organization

408
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,383
but also be tactically implementable

409
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:22,760
by practitioners using
what you already have.

410
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,300
Sure, throughout the
course of your gap analysis

411
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,899
and trying to highlight your
data, applications, assets

412
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,620
and services, you might have, you know,

413
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,150
areas where unique control
structures to support those

414
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,380
you know, to support those efforts.

415
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,290
But it's not a product driven approach.

416
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,090
And it's really the opposite.

417
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,709
It's a prevention strategy
that gives you, you know,

418
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,760
that business enablement
across the end point,

419
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,810
then that word, the cloud,
consumer data in and so forth.

420
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,639
And that is why it's so powerful.

421
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,630
It requires folks to operate a little bit

422
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,783
of ambiguity and see where they're going.

423
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,530
- How do the requirements fit in

424
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,280
from a compliance point of
view with this then, Warren?

425
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,340
- I am, I'm just kind of
amused at my teammates here.

426
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,837
They're talking about doing
all these cool things.

427
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,500
And the reason why they're doing them is

428
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,010
because compliance said
they had to, right.

429
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,740
Lisa talks about privacy and building it

430
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,530
as they go as part of a solution.

431
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,420
Rob's talking about
not a specific solution

432
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,420
but in a strategy or approach to security.

433
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,560
And it's all, it's all trying to get

434
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,300
to a place of compliance.

435
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,870
I struggle with privacy
in my head, you know,

436
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,570
yesterday was a national burrito day

437
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,189
and Chipotle had this form
where you could fill it

438
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,070
out and try to guess their Bitcoin wallet

439
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,800
if you give them your email address.

440
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,393
Americans don't care about privacy, right?

441
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,550
So I'm really struggling with that.

442
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,409
I have a Garmin watch.

443
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,243
I love it.

444
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:51,698
It tells me, it tells me where I've run.

445
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:53,880
I gave up the privacy of knowing that

446
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,030
because I want to be able
to post those cool pictures

447
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,480
of how far I ran on Instagram.

448
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,130
So, you know, I'm struggling.

449
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm struggling with that,

450
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,000
how compliance doesn't kind of lead us

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
down the privacy and security path.

452
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,110
Also, one more, one
more, I just want to say,

453
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,729
I struggle with, with zero trust

454
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,110
because it literally says
I don't trust the users.

455
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,780
The users are dumb.

456
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,113
Talk to me about that.

457
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,603
- So Lisa, first with your
rebuttal, is privacy dead?

458
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,330
- Oh, so I've actually
been using terms lately.

459
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,320
Take back your (indistinct)
own your privacy, not dead.

460
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,860
It's very much (indistinct).

461
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,189
It's what everybody's talking about.

462
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,230
Security has been around for years.

463
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,350
We've been doing the same thing over

464
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,699
and over and over, right, Groundhog's day.

465
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,000
We talk about that a lot

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,676
the same thing that keeps breaking

467
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,740
but nobody's doing it right.

468
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,560
But we're not there yet with privacy.

469
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,399
So I don't think it's dead.

470
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,900
I think it's very much alive.

471
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,180
I think people have a right to take back

472
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,700
and own their privacy.

473
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,500
So Warren, to your point,
yes, we do give up some things

474
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,150
to have the luxuries
of these technologies.

475
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,720
However, that doesn't
mean you're sacrificing

476
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,050
your privacy to do that, right?

477
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,149
You need to know

478
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,750
and understand what you're
giving up or not giving up

479
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,910
or what obligations the company has

480
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,170
to protect that information and
make sure that you own that.

481
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,170
And you have the right to say, no.

482
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,403
It's not okay to have
information to do processing.

483
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,540
- This requires an
intelligent end user though

484
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,210
to know their rights,
know where your data is

485
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,010
and where it's being used.

486
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,960
And this was one of the
points you made, Warren,

487
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,870
regarding zero trust.

488
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,260
Does this really mean that
we don't trust our end users?

489
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,410
Or how does this fit
with zero trust, Robert?

490
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,810
- Yeah. Let's, let's dispel
a few notions here, right?

491
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,409
Zero trust is not about
not trusting users.

492
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,610
It's about eliminating the concept

493
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,310
of trust altogether in an organization.

494
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,340
Let's think about that for a second.

495
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,189
We talked about perimeter defense earlier

496
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,130
how it was designed to
block untrusted connections

497
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,550
into a trusted environment.

498
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,510
And we trusted everything
else from, you know,

499
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,870
on the inside, just like an M and M right?

500
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,149
The hard outside shell, gooey
chocolate in the middle.

501
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,380
Zero trust means you're
rebuilding security

502
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,320
from the inside out.

503
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,960
It replaces your traditional
security defenses

504
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,200
and controls with data
alliance security controls

505
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,550
throughout the organization.

506
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,169
You're building it from the inside out.

507
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,470
It's not rigid.

508
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,660
Another important aspect and understanding

509
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,450
of zero trust is that it
doesn't have a single approach.

510
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,710
It's not cookie cutter.

511
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,220
Like I'm gonna go and deploy firewalls

512
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,500
at every single point.

513
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,333
I'm gonna move

514
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,840
to a micro segmented
hyperconverged technology stack

515
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,919
because then I can put a
firewall on every machine.

516
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,980
That's not what it's talking about.

517
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,830
What it's talking about is
the data applications, assets

518
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,949
and services, the requirements
have access to each

519
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,150
of those is going to vary
depending on, you know

520
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,370
what's being a process

521
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,000
and who has the ability
to access that data

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,130
or that application or the
underlying device needs to align

523
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,230
with the appropriateness.

524
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,720
That's all we're talking about.

525
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,070
And you know, it's also
not about just identity.

526
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,240
It's much more than that.

527
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,280
It's an allegation of, you
know, the security controls.

528
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,117
So it eliminate trust altogether

529
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:18,740
and build it from the ground up.

530
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,510
What we're talking about
is not, not new, right?

531
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,410
It's how security should
have been implemented

532
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,523
from the ground up several decades ago.

533
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:26,256
- All right.

534
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:27,089
I have a question.

535
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,096
I've got a question to
that, Ron, real quick.

536
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:32,230
How does one get that funding, Rob?

537
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,747
Right. It's difficult
to go in and say, well

538
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,530
"Zero trust is cool," right?

539
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,870
What do you tie that to?

540
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,703
You're a CISO.

541
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,410
You've got to talk to the CFO.

542
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,410
You've got to get the money.

543
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,373
How does that work?

544
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,440
- That's a great question.

545
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,390
First and foremost we're
not advocating going out

546
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,450
and purchasing new equipment,

547
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,560
new applications, new technology.

548
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,060
It goes back to one of the points that you

549
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,480
had commented earlier on, Rob.

550
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,160
What security are storytellers, right?

551
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,200
We have to communicate and
understand what the risk is

552
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,660
the asset, the threat actors,
the effect, the loss events.

553
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,860
If I can share my CFO and my peers

554
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,790
and I'm able to deliver more
cost-effective risk management

555
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,800
at a lower operating cost
at the end of the day

556
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,649
over the next few years
by re-tool, not retooling,

557
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,650
that's the wrong word by, by reorganizing

558
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,980
how I apply my limited
cycles and resources.

559
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,330
That's a win-win.

560
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,370
But the problem is, is you
got to help folks understand

561
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,639
you know, you have to
gather the data and map it.

562
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,120
And I think that's where
the biggest rub is.

563
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,959
A lot of organizations don't know where

564
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,820
their data applications,
assets, and services truly sit.

565
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,570
So the effort that you have
to go through to fill that out

566
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,671
to get to the other side is
where a lot of the, you know,

567
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:44,960
the cost and the time
requirements come into play

568
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,320
that that folks have heartburn with.

569
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,620
- So who owns the data?

570
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Lisa as a privacy person,
is this, is data owned

571
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,909
by the business, is it
owned by infrastructure?

572
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,890
How does all of this data
management fit with this?

573
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,420
- Privacy laws say that you own your data

574
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,000
as an individual and the
company within an organization,

575
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,660
the old mantra was it was
owned by the business.

576
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,170
The business decided
what was done with it,

577
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,810
how it was collected, what was collected.

578
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,300
But we're actually
seeing a shift from that,

579
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,080
where now a lot of organizations
have data analysts,

580
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,139
data analytics teams,
that they're the ones

581
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,644
that are manipulating the data,

582
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:29,250
running these reports,
doing what they need

583
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,490
to scrub the data for various things.

584
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,110
And I'm starting to see
a shift where it's moving

585
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,870
from the business, owning the data

586
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,850
to the backend technology teams

587
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,043
and those data teams that are managing it.

588
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,470
- Lisa, privacy is only
important if it's important

589
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,040
to your, if you have data
on your customers, right?

590
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,510
Like why would I care?

591
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,500
Why would I care about
privacy only to meet a GDPR

592
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,280
or HIPAA compliance, right?

593
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,530
But after I'm compliant, right,

594
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,833
and only if it's appropriate again

595
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,130
with my appropriate statements, right,

596
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,880
if it's not appropriate, privacy is

597
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,760
like a cherry on top of
the ice cream, right?

598
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,520
- But is it?

599
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Because there's other things besides just

600
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,290
you know, informational data
that you're talking about.

601
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,909
What about company
proprietary information,

602
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,490
intellectual property?

603
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,040
You want to keep that private
and protected just as equally.

604
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,980
And so some of those laws,
that's what they get into.

605
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,910
It's different categories of information.

606
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,190
So it's not just data on an individual

607
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,950
but what do you have about the company?

608
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,870
What do you not want to get out?

609
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,469
So Warren, to your point, yes,

610
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,850
from a compliance perspective

611
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,639
companies are just maybe looking

612
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,000
at the GDPR, CCPA, the regs themselves.

613
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,070
But you also need to
look at the other type

614
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,169
of data that you have
within an organization

615
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,250
and making sure that that's
protected and private as well

616
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,317
because you don't want that leaked out.

617
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:57,190
I mean that could be
detrimental to an organization.

618
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,290
And that's where Rob comes

619
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,159
in to protect it from
a security perspective.

620
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,280
- Yeah. And that's why
there's so much Harper, right?

621
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,800
Because it's the context

622
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,419
around how we are being compliant.

623
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,590
Compliance, I think, Warren,
is so important and you see it

624
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,199
as the foundational
element because there's,

625
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,160
there's X, Y and Z that
I have to go out and do,

626
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,830
prove that I'm doing it and we move on.

627
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,669
Privacy and security, I think are

628
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,820
are continuously moving up the
stack, trying to understand

629
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,700
and add different context and layers

630
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,850
to right-align those controls.

631
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,530
But it's getting through that process

632
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,700
where the business is needing education

633
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,800
and coaching on why should
I care about having three

634
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,620
or four different data
classification levels,

635
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,780
if I can just classify it the
same, apply the same controls.

636
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,820
I can check the box once and be done?

637
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,947
We're starting to see regulations

638
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:44,510
that are requiring not
just regulations, right,

639
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,343
but even customer

640
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:47,550
due-diligence agreements
requiring entities

641
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,990
to get more refined and
right-size their data controls,

642
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,410
which, you know, I think builds on top of

643
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,390
why it's so important to
to do it the right way

644
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,373
versus just ensuring a control's in place.

645
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,113
- The other thing--
- One second Lisa.

646
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,950
First of all, for those who are watching

647
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,140
you see that there's a lot

648
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,850
of conflict between compliance,
privacy and security,

649
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,939
which is what we're
trying to solve with this.

650
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,190
Whether you're in a role yourself

651
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,680
or you're working across these roles.

652
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,830
As you have questions,
please put them in the chat.

653
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,860
We are here, even though
this is being recorded

654
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,919
we are available to answer your questions.

655
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,300
Now, Lisa, you are gonna mention something

656
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,480
your viewpoint about privacy with this.

657
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,030
- Yeah. So the other thing I
would add to Warren's comment

658
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,550
about why privacy is
important, maybe CCPA and GDPR

659
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,260
and those other couple that are out there

660
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,860
don't apply to your organization.

661
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,040
That's a question that I get asked often.

662
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,139
So why should I care?

663
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,610
It's not, it doesn't
apply to my company yet.

664
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,840
And the response that I give
to that is it's coming, right?

665
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,179
It may not apply today.

666
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,380
You may not have to comply

667
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,780
with California or the
EU privacy regulations

668
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,280
but Virginia just passed their law today.

669
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,350
Oklahoma's got one that's going through,

670
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,730
Minnesota several other States.

671
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,480
I tell people privacy
is like a data breach.

672
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,890
It's not a matter of if, but when

673
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,610
and these privacy laws are coming.

674
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,780
So it's best to be ready

675
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,322
for them now than when
they become effective.

676
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,949
- When you layer on top of,

677
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,270
I think you're gonna see
continued legislation

678
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,260
to incentivize adherence to
best security control practices.

679
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,020
Take, for example, the modifications made

680
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,060
to the HIPAA safe Harbor
law in January of this year,

681
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,500
that there are caps on the penalties

682
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,410
that the Department of
Health and Human Services

683
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,380
can leverage or, you know, implement

684
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,190
on HIPAA regulated organizations,

685
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,360
as long as they're following

686
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,860
and can prove that for
the previous 12 months,

687
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,600
that they've had, you know, cybersecurity

688
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,169
best practices implemented, may point

689
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,480
to the cybersecurity act of 2015

690
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,020
and industry best guidelines,

691
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,790
like those from the NIST
organization, right?

692
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,280
You're gonna continue to see incentives

693
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,300
for organizations to right-size
their security controls.

694
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,780
As Lisa mentioned, privacy controls.

695
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,660
I think at the end of the day,

696
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,730
it's gonna, Warren, you and
your teams should be jumping

697
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,561
for joy because it's gonna make,

698
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:08,537
I think the compliance
teams (indistinct) easier

699
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:09,503
at the end of the day.

700
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,723
- I'm not sure about--

701
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:15,923
Wow. There was a lot,
there was a lot there.

702
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,689
I'm kinda thinking in my head,

703
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,840
I want to ask Lisa a similar question

704
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,840
of how does one get
leadership to fund an effort

705
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,010
on the, "It's coming, it's coming," right?

706
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,960
That's I can think of an
example of a very large company.

707
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,540
I won't mention its name,

708
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,500
but they have a little
bit of data on all of us.

709
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,940
And they spent 20 years doing acquisitions

710
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,600
and getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

711
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
And now that it came and
they had a deal with a lot

712
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,860
of issues that came up, now
they're paying to fix it.

713
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,850
Right. But in the years to get there

714
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,760
they just made gobs and gobs of money.

715
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,480
And you know what, I'm trying to talk

716
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,840
to companies that's they
don't want to spend a nickel

717
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,570
on something that's coming, it's coming.

718
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,080
We'll spend that money when we get there.

719
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,980
You know, I was thinking
about HIPAA the other day

720
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,582
and I know that Lisa likes
to scare me with fines.

721
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,050
With HIPAA, right, level
one level two fines,

722
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,560
start at like 60, you know,

723
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,620
run up to like 60K I think.

724
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,260
And I think like the most
you can get for a year,

725
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,680
is like, 1,000,005, right?

726
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,290
If I'm a really large company

727
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,720
that's like paying a speeding
ticket, I don't really care.

728
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,553
I'll get there.

729
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:24,970
I'll do it.

730
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,340
What would you say to that, Lisa?

731
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,939
- So, yeah, it's way.

732
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,920
It may be easier to pay the fine,

733
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,010
but what is that going to look

734
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,260
like for your brand and
reputation out on the street?

735
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,200
And in a recent survey that I seen

736
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,540
where organizations were surveyed,

737
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,520
what's the most important to you?

738
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,430
Their brand and reputation
were the top things.

739
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,290
It wasn't fines, it
wasn't even compliance.

740
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,830
It was what does the industry,

741
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,830
what do my, you know, individuals look at

742
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,020
when they look at our company?

743
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,580
And that's important.

744
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,820
So I would say that that's
how you get funding,

745
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,830
and that's how you get
funding for security.

746
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,600
That's how you get funding
for compliance and privacy.

747
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,280
It shouldn't be just to meet
a law or regulation, right?

748
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,460
Have a solid compliance
and security framework.

749
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,790
You shouldn't, you know,
like it's been mentioned here

750
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,767
these are things we should
have already been doing

751
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:23,210
that companies are just now
starting to get on board with

752
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,030
because of the increase in
fines, increase in data breaches.

753
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,560
And to your comment, Rob, you
mentioned the new HIPAA law.

754
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,639
The state of Utah has recently
published just this year

755
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,270
a new law on security and breaches.

756
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,860
And if you can prove that
you've done the right thing,

757
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,263
you know, similar to what
you mentioned with HIPAA,

758
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:43,870
that the fines might be less,

759
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,169
but if you, if they can prove negligence

760
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,950
that you didn't have the
right controls in place,

761
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,060
those fines can just start incrementing

762
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,879
and can be astronomical.

763
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,330
So why not just do the right
thing from the beginning

764
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,659
or even backtrack to fix
what you didn't do initially?

765
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,853
Because it's cheaper.

766
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,800
- One of the things I'd like
to begin to transition to,

767
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,690
we were seeing a lot of the
challenges between compliance,

768
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,500
privacy and security, and sometimes again

769
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,340
the butting of the heads,
which one is most important.

770
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,720
And maybe the answer is,
really all of the above.

771
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,740
They all have their specific role.

772
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,040
And of course it depends
for the organization.

773
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,899
So Robert, while we were
talking earlier, you mentioned

774
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,870
that a lot of this comes
back to understanding risks

775
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,100
and risk management
within the organization

776
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,330
and being able to work with the business.

777
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,850
So what solutions do
you provide as a CISO?

778
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,490
For how do does security
compliance and privacy,

779
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,210
how can we work together?

780
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,203
How do we work with business leaders?

781
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,870
- Yeah, that's fantastic questions there.

782
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,209
I think that first and
foremost, I try to establish,

783
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,720
as much of a professional
relationship with my peers

784
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,800
and other teams, is I do a
personal relationship, right?

785
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,850
I need to have that
foundational level of trust

786
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,219
and approachability and
advocate my team do the same.

787
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,850
The next level is we try to aggregate

788
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,339
and understand how the
business gets worked on,

789
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,070
aggregate within, you know

790
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,739
not just securities risk
register, but have a center

791
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,120
of excellences, and
cross-collaboration teams

792
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,540
to complete a well-rounded risk register.

793
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,210
Talk about and agree on things

794
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,250
like the assets that are at risk.

795
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,100
What, what the heck is a
loss effect, a loss event?

796
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,440
How frequently is that gonna happen?

797
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,190
And can we agree or come to a consensus

798
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,380
or range on what the impact
to our business is, right?

799
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,266
A data breach on a server
that's classified as

800
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:41,266
as public does not have the
same impact as a data breach on

801
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,069
on a mission, critical
crown jewels, you know

802
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,130
server for media, highly
regulated organizations.

803
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,409
So context is, is important.

804
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,830
Warren mentioned appropriateness.

805
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,429
The same thing applies in security, right?

806
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,609
So again, we've helped
right-size right-align

807
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,860
those controls with our
peers, hold the whole

808
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,970
cross-collaboration section.

809
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,629
So we come to an agreement
on, on what the number

810
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,800
we're trying to mitigate is,
and then it's easy tracking

811
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,050
you know, value back to the business.

812
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,640
'Cause you, you can't accept
a risk that is more than the

813
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,540
the, you know, more than,
than the cost of the controls

814
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,770
right, that, that does not fly our work.

815
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,530
I think at the end of the
day, too, we're also tracking,

816
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,500
enhancing our metrics
within security, right?

817
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,360
So think meantime to
identification, containment,

818
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,190
resolution, and adhering to
SLAs that customers are putting

819
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,400
on organizations like mine.

820
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,160
So even if you're a single organization

821
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,710
you might have business SLAs, right?

822
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,143
You might have other oversight, so.

823
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,620
- What solutions or
ideas do you give those

824
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,240
who are in compliance in compliance roles

825
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,500
whether internal or an external auditor,

826
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,510
how can we best leverage
our auditors as a part

827
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,353
of security and privacy
roles and responsibilities?

828
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,419
- I think that it's really important

829
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,420
that an individual and a
compliance organization be outgoing

830
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,080
and work across the aisle with
all those different groups.

831
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,580
(indistinct)

832
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,719
You know,

833
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,900
there's some way for everybody to get

834
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,060
them communicate their message.

835
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,380
I think we've all been

836
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,970
in a role at one point
in time when, you know

837
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,129
maybe they're the auditor
and they're reaching

838
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,850
out to the audit client to get some data.

839
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,930
And, you know, a week,

840
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,140
two week goes by or the third
week goes by, you're sending

841
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,029
that threatening email via
the vice president, right.

842
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,017
And then immediately response is,

843
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,609
"Hey, Hey what's your problem?

844
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,210
Why are you being so threatening?"

845
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,280
It's like, well, I was
trying to be communicative.

846
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,438
So maybe, you know,
picking up the phone and

847
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:48,210
and moving away from the email and trying

848
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,810
to actually develop a
relationship, I think is critical.

849
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,290
It doesn't matter whether
you're in compliance role

850
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,750
or you're an internal audit role.

851
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,600
If you turn that on the other side,

852
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,460
if you're an IT person
who's on the receiving end

853
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,930
of audits, you know, get
involved in the strategy, right?

854
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,299
Where does, where does the
good ideas phase happen?

855
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,530
It's it's not normally insecurity.

856
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,230
It's not normally in the
infrastructure or IT groups,

857
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,500
it's coming from the business.

858
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,040
They want to do cool stuff.

859
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,930
And you know, it's the guys
like Rob in that CISO function

860
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,710
that are saying, "Nah, that's not secure.

861
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,070
I don't want to use that app," right?

862
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,320
They're, the buzzkill but they're learning

863
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,200
that that's, you know, that's
old school CISOs, right?

864
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,160
They're trying to figure
out ways to be involved.

865
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,690
And I think that needs to
trickle down to the, to, you know

866
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,070
to the director and
manager and below levels

867
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,550
and start to get involved in

868
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,630
and communicate more effectively.

869
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,770
- And maybe that's where
privacy plays a role

870
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,810
because it's getting a
lot of fresh right now.

871
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,650
People are paying attention to privacy.

872
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,760
So Lisa, what are maybe some

873
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,610
of your top two techniques
for maybe managing conflict

874
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,560
between these different types of roles?

875
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,250
- Yeah. So the first thing
that I have done when I was

876
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,720
in this role was I actually implemented

877
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,720
a compliance security
cross-functional meeting,

878
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,600
be that weekly, monthly,

879
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,060
whatever works best for your organization.

880
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,830
But pull your leaders together,

881
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,680
pull your frontline people together,

882
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,390
have those conversations.

883
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,720
You know, like Robin,
Warren have talked about.

884
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,430
Cross-functional discussions is critical

885
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,230
to the success, regardless
of what role you're in,

886
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,900
be it compliance privacy or security,

887
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,980
because they're so
interrelated that one change

888
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,600
in one area is going to impact the others.

889
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,839
The other thing that I've done, Ron,

890
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,180
is leveraging external counsel.

891
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,640
I am not a lawyer though
I know a lot of the laws.

892
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,370
But it's always important to
have a legal, a legal partner,

893
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,140
be it internal or external,

894
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,470
depending on the size
of your organization.

895
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,529
Your compliance folks may
also have law backgrounds.

896
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,340
But somebody needs to have that last say

897
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,147
for the organization to say,

898
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,610
"These laws and these regulations apply.

899
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,510
And this is how they apply."

900
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,157
So working with legal
is also, is important.

901
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,490
- Yeah. I think one thing

902
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,220
that is extremely important
sometimes often overlooked

903
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,259
and can be a showstopper for some,

904
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,620
it might be the organizational
culture and the lack

905
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,420
of working norms amongst teams
or amongst business units.

906
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,700
If that doesn't exist
too, it can be very hard

907
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,439
to host those cross
collaboration, those center

908
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,290
of excellence meetings.

909
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,050
So there might be
foundational issues that we

910
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,240
as security clients or privacy
professionals need to work on

911
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,330
outside of our roles.

912
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,290
In order for us to even
begin chipping away

913
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,730
at the conversation issue,
it could be much larger

914
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,370
than what we're experiencing.

915
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,069
And that could be one of
the contributing factors

916
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,990
to why the ComPriSec role
is so difficult to manage

917
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,120
and lead through is because of the,

918
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,660
maybe the nonadherence or the lack of

919
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,620
those working norms and
the cultural values, so.

920
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,647
- But those meetings can also help

921
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:53,220
be break through those barriers

922
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,020
of some of those norms, because
you're getting the input

923
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,810
and this perspective together
with everybody on the call

924
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,570
instead of those one-off
water cooler conversations

925
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,780
that often happen in the office,

926
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,650
this forces everybody
to come to the table.

927
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,140
It forces everybody to share
their thoughts and opinions,

928
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,890
be it right or wrong, right?

929
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,210
At least your voice is heard

930
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,150
and people understand your position.

931
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,320
So it can help break some of those norms

932
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,170
and break through those barriers
and work towards change.

933
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,080
- And that's where I've
leveraged compliance

934
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,830
and audit particularly external.

935
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,560
Who has this different
perspective who may be

936
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,020
can bring people to the table

937
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,853
but they're saying,

938
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,469
"Here's how your competitor is doing it."

939
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:35,670
They're having these conversations

940
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,630
between compliance, privacy and security,

941
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,470
whether you're in a
ComPriSec role by yourself

942
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,160
or you're trying to manage
the conflicts in between them.

943
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,040
Let's transition into our
action slide at this point.

944
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,730
And how can we apply what we're hearing

945
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,020
in this conversation in your organization?

946
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,570
Well, first of all, for
those who are watching

947
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,950
think about the who,
what, why, when, where

948
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,950
and how ComPriSec is used
within your organization.

949
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,290
Think about the compliance
role, the privacy role

950
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,360
the security role, who
has it, who's responsible.

951
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,110
It can be different between that.

952
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,050
As we've talked about data management,

953
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,130
you might have a DBA
managing the database.

954
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,650
You might have a systems manager

955
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,940
and you may have a
business owner who kind of

956
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,270
is controlling the data.

957
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,800
Where, when and how

958
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,940
is ComPriSec handled
within your organization?

959
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,394
Step two, as we've been talking about,

960
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:35,779
it often just starts with
reaching across the table.

961
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,000
If you will, I'm
simulating, shaking hands,

962
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,380
having coffee with someone
in that other role.

963
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,910
what I've done as an assessor and auditor.

964
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,397
I've actually gone to the
security people and said,

965
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:51,360
"Is there something you
want me to put in my audit?"

966
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,860
Because they probably already
know the noncompliant areas

967
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,670
or the areas of improvement
for security or privacy,

968
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,450
but I'm coming in from the outside

969
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,120
with some power, is
compliance, right, Warren?

970
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,480
So I can go in and kind of speak

971
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,770
for those who may have
been silenced in the past.

972
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,670
And then third, as Lisa mentioned,

973
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,520
looking at the difference in
different industry standards,

974
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,500
actually all three,
Warren mentioned NIST out,

975
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,370
Rob has mentioned PCI and
Lisa has mentioned HIPAA

976
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,380
and all the different privacy standards,

977
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,910
particularly the new ones
that we're seeing coming out.

978
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,129
And then within the next
three months, how can we

979
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,330
be most efficient?

980
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,930
And we'll end with this, is
if we can be more efficient

981
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,330
with our security and
privacy and compliance.

982
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,430
That's often how we can get
through to business leaders,

983
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,109
particularly those in the financial area,

984
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,250
saying how we save money, time and effort

985
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,680
across the different areas.

986
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,100
And then lastly, how do we implement?

987
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,470
Think about how you can
implement these solutions

988
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,100
we've been talking about.

989
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,960
As we're running shorter on time

990
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,320
go around the table again,
ask for your final thoughts

991
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,880
in the last so about
30 to 60 seconds each.

992
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,110
Rob, what are your
parting thoughts regarding

993
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,773
the security viewpoint of ComPriSec?

994
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,810
- Security can help unlock and align all

995
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,810
of the various ComPriSec
competing priorities

996
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,557
and interests by one, advocating for

997
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:26,709
the business data align controls,

998
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,090
making sure that we're aware of where

999
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,620
the crown jewels are, what
the biggest threats are

1000
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,506
and being able to translate
that at all levels

1001
00:43:34,506 --> 00:43:39,040
to actionable words, English,
and be able to translate

1002
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,470
both quantitative and qualitatively.

1003
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,700
That's a mouthful there,
but you need to partner

1004
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,919
with your leadership, your engineers,

1005
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,360
those that know it best.

1006
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,530
That's going to help you fill in the dots,

1007
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,290
fill in the gaps to
level up your strategy,

1008
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,920
which is going to in turn, move the knobs,

1009
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,870
move the wheels to rightsize, right-align,

1010
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,779
to get you on board a
cost effective digital

1011
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,430
and cloud aligned program with your peers

1012
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,879
- Warren, in your parting thoughts.

1013
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,480
- I just love that everybody
everybody's answers

1014
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,370
includes doing some compliance.

1015
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,560
It's perfect.

1016
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,420
It's telling the story for me.

1017
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,080
So ultimately I would tell
everybody who's listening,

1018
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,720
you know, whether you're a developer

1019
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,720
or a security architect,
or, you know, an auditor,

1020
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,410
it doesn't matter, wherever
you're at in your organization

1021
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,859
or if you're working
with other organizations,

1022
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,750
you really need to think
what's appropriate.

1023
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,490
What is appropriate for my organization?

1024
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,689
You know, Lisa keeps talking about

1025
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,890
all this new stuff coming out,

1026
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,230
and certainly those are
compliance regulations

1027
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,950
that people are going to have to meet.

1028
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,620
What is going to apply
to your organization

1029
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,069
in the near future?

1030
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,960
Start talking to your peers,
start talking with legal

1031
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,740
and with your audit and with anybody else

1032
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,169
who will listen to the company
to start getting that stuff

1033
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,903
in the pipeline and funded and worked on.

1034
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:01,940
- Determining that level

1035
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,690
of appropriateness is
always the delicate balance.

1036
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,300
Why we need experts in
compliance, privacy and security.

1037
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,990
So Lisa, your parting
thoughts on ComPriSec.

1038
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,959
- Yeah. Thanks, Ron.

1039
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,170
So a couple of comments
that I have is the first

1040
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,840
thing is having a compliance footprint.

1041
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,930
Something that lays out here's
all the industry standards,

1042
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,740
regulations and frameworks
that our company needs

1043
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,000
to adhere to, working with legal,

1044
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,190
working with a third party consulting firm

1045
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,860
a trusted advisor that can help confirm.

1046
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,870
Yes, this is what you should be doing.

1047
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,040
Because I can assure you

1048
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,009
that after going through that exercise

1049
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,598
most likely the organization
will identify things

1050
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:41,370
that they didn't even know.

1051
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,710
There's the known knowns
that we've talked about today

1052
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,610
but there are so many
unknown things out there

1053
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,340
that companies just don't
realize, apply to them

1054
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,020
until they really start
having those conversations.

1055
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,230
The other thing that
I would recommend too,

1056
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,740
is having segregations of duties.

1057
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,350
So where you do find people
in these ComPriSec roles,

1058
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,700
listen to them.

1059
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,759
I know when I was

1060
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,803
in this position, it's very challenging,

1061
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:11,470
trying to be that expert
in all of these areas.

1062
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,370
So I have worked with
leadership to find ways

1063
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,380
to have segregation of
duties leaned on leadership

1064
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,470
to be that advocate
voice, and also make sure

1065
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,549
that roles and responsibilities
are clearly defined.

1066
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,740
It's oftentimes that somebody ends up

1067
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,649
in this ComPriSec role
because somebody else

1068
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,570
isn't doing their job
adequately or sufficiently.

1069
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,830
So roles and responsibilities
is extremely important.

1070
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,177
And when somebody's
raising their hand to say,

1071
00:46:39,177 --> 00:46:42,470
"There's issues and I'm having
to pick up this extra work,"

1072
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,459
listen to them.

1073
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,110
Don't think that they're
just enabling somebody else

1074
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,600
to be lazy or to get off with the work.

1075
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,360
They're trying to be the right voice

1076
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,770
for the organization and help
your frontline individuals.

1077
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,652
So see what you can do
to help them resolve

1078
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:58,990
these conflicts that
we've identified today.

1079
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,470
- Wow. Great tips from all three.

1080
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,759
Thank you all so much.

1081
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,720
Because ComPriSec is a
part of all organizations,

1082
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,520
no matter your size or sector,

1083
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,460
compliance, privacy and
security are all growth areas.

1084
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,370
This session provided
you with some tips on how

1085
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,319
do we bring together compliance,
privacy and security,

1086
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,690
giving you ideas for how do you improve

1087
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,460
your organizations' ComPriSec.

1088
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,760
Please connect with Rob, Lisa and myself

1089
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,665
on social media, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

1090
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:33,380
You can also ask questions in the chat.

1091
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,837
Thank you again for
this wonderful session.

1092
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:39,230
Lisa, Warren and Rob, and we'll see

1093
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,040
be seeing you all on the other side.

1094
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,077
Thank you.

1095
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:44,182
- Thank you.

1096
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:45,182
- Thank you.
