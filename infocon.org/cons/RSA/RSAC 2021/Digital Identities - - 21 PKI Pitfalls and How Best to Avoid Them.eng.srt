1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,350
- Hi, and thank you for joining us today.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,390
This is Digital
Identities, 21 PKI Pitfalls

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,330
and How Best to Avoid Them.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,930
I am Tim, the Chief
Compliance Officer at Sectigo,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,870
and I'll let Jason introduce himself.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,020
- Yes, my name is Jason.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,380
I'm the CTO of PKI at Sectigo

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,759
- And Jay, and I do this
sort of thing together a lot

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,600
because we do have a PKI podcast,

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,630
a rather long running at
this point, PKI podcasts.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,740
So we'll talk about that
a little more in the end,

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,420
but if we feel like we have
had these conversations before

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,690
it's because we've had many,
many conversations before.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,629
So we do look at a lot of PKI,

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,630
so Sectigo is a leader in the PKI space.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,210
We have a variety of tools,
we offer certificates,

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,590
and we also offer
certificate management tools.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,590
And as a consequence, we deal
with a lot of enterprises

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,500
that are either creating or using PKI,

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,420
and we get a lot of visibility

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,360
on the various ways that
things can go right,

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,790
and the various ways that
things can go not so right.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,330
So what we hope to do today

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,810
is just talk you through
the PKI errors as we see,

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,980
the common pitfalls, explain what they are

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,110
and maybe how to be on
the lookout for them

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,270
and what to do about them,
does that sound good, Jay?

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,690
- That's good, Tim, thank you.

29
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,850
- So we divided this into five
different kinds of problems,

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,229
you can see them right
here; certificate problems,

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,760
deployment problems, security problems,

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,690
governance problems and
visibility problems.

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,970
And we are going to drill down on each

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,530
of these types of PKI pitfalls to avoid.

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,780
So first off certificate, op.

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,260
There we go, here we go,
so those are the five.

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,950
So first off certificate problems.

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,670
Jay, problem number one, weak keys.

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,010
- Yes, you know Tim,

40
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,500
you and I talk a lot about
on our root causes podcast.

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,640
The whole idea that there
there are specific key links

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
that are chosen in the industry.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,200
And unless you have a
sufficient amount of entropy,

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,200
the sufficient amount of bit length within

45
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,030
that is chosen with your keys,

46
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,190
it might make it a
little bit easy to hack.

47
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,870
And therefore you should really go

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,820
with industry standards,
industry best practices.

49
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,930
a weak keys or something
you should look for,

50
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,584
have visibility to and
try to avoid at all costs.

51
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,670
- And numbers do move,
they don't move very often,

52
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,799
but if you have, you know?

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,520
If you're a gray hair like
Jay and I are, you know?

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,890
The key length that you believe that

55
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,179
was acceptable 20 years ago
when you started in your job

56
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,050
may not be acceptable anymore.

57
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,860
So it's a good idea to make sure that

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,990
you're with the current practices on that.

59
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,653
And then of course, the problem
if they do have weak keys,

60
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,460
the trouble with that, Jay is?

61
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,350
- The trouble is it kind of depends.

62
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,590
If it's publicly trusted certificates,

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,750
hopefully you're getting it
from a certificate authority

64
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,963
that is obviously using
the correct key links,

65
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:11,320
RSA 2048, ECC 256, et cetera,

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,880
typically where you're gonna see problems

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,790
with weak keys though Tim,

68
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,890
is in privately trusted environments.

69
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,303
IOT perhaps even DevOps.

70
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:22,140
So that's a situation where somebody

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,329
who might not be a PKI professional

72
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,300
might have chosen incorrect default.

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,133
And that's where you're gonna see

74
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,995
more of a problems more commonly.

75
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:32,070
- Yeah, the public CA's
are gonna take care

76
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,049
of a lot of these for you,

77
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,260
and maybe we can clarify
which ones they do and don't,

78
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,679
but this page is gonna be pretty much okay

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,532
for the public CA's because
they can't give you the certs,

80
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:44,150
(chuckles) it would be against the rules,

81
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,580
but when you control your PKI,

82
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,960
you get to do whatever you want, right?

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,690
So that's where a lot of
the certificate problems

84
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,670
are gonna come from.

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,790
The second one on the
list, the term is too long.

86
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,500
So in the public certificate space,

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,560
depending on the certificate type,

88
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,680
if it's an SSL or TLS certificate,

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,430
you're limited to one year,
essentially 13 months.

90
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,780
If it's an S/MIME or
code signing certificate,

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,400
it's limited to three years.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,240
But once again, if you're
issuing certificates on your CA,

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,947
you get to do whatever you like.

94
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:16,107
And one of the things we see
sometimes is someone says,

95
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,880
"Oh, this is great, I'll issue a cert.

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
I'll make it 20 years long,

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,719
and I'll never need any
worry about it ever again".

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,750
- You know, Tim, for terms,

99
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,070
especially again in the
private trust world,

100
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,810
which is mostly where I live,

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,610
it's quite common now
to see you much shorter

102
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,090
and shorter terms being
chosen for two reasons.

103
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,510
One is because it just flat out,

104
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,760
it makes the difficulty
level of the bad guy easier.

105
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,450
If you don't have a very
long live certificate.

106
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,010
If a long live certificate
is captured by a bad guy,

107
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,263
that bad guy has a long time
then to go doing bad things.

108
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,970
So therefore shorter
and shorter term lengths

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,150
are becoming more common.

110
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,409
That requires certificate
management, of course,

111
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,590
but that's part of what modern
PKI is gonna be promising us.

112
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,429
- And we'll be getting
to that I'm sure, right?

113
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,240
So just by reducing certificate term,

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,000
you reduce the potential
attack time, right?

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,780
Pure and simple, there's only so long

116
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,710
that you can work on a cert

117
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,150
before that So it doesn't matter.

118
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,820
Outdated cryptographic algorithms.

119
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,130
So once again, as with key lengths,

120
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,260
these are things that do evolve over time.

121
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,240
You know, once upon a time SHA-1

122
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,590
was considered to be state-of-the-art.

123
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,022
Now, SHA-1 is deprecated and
is considered to be unsafe.

124
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,500
And we'll come up on the
fact where RSA and ECC

125
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,910
will be considered to be unsafe,

126
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,920
that's not that many years away.

127
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,600
So cryptographic algorithms do change

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,770
and you need to stay current,

129
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,210
and we still see people using SHA-1 still.

130
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,270
- Yeah, So we're mixing a few things there

131
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,426
where the primitives, right?

132
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,250
The hashing algorithms are the ones where

133
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,360
deprecated cryptographic algorithms

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,770
are things that we've seen
quite commonly in the past,

135
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,030
and we've to deal with them.

136
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,609
Again, visibility of the certificates

137
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,330
that you're issuing and using
is incredibly important,

138
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,960
because just like you
don't wanna use a weak key,

139
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
you do not wanna be using

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,660
an outdated cryptographic algorithm

141
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,100
whether it's for hashing or anything else.

142
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,434
Once again, though, in the public world,

143
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:17,370
the CA's are typically
doing this thinking for you

144
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,040
but it's when in the private world

145
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
where you're having to do
this thinking yourself,

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,909
where it's quite easy to make mistakes.

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,560
- Yeah, for sure, and then
certificates stapling.

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,251
Oops, talk to us about
certificate stapling, Jay.

149
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,912
- Sure Tim, you know this was a big topic.

150
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,039
I think mobile devices are where this

151
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,570
really came up quite a lot,

152
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,340
where certificates were
used in mobile apps.

153
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,340
And it was quite common for applications

154
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,660
to hard-code public key information.

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,801
And unfortunately,
applications don't get updated

156
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,820
as often sometimes as need be

157
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,820
to be able to keep up with
perhaps a revoked certificate.

158
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,650
And so therefore something
happens in the background

159
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,840
all of a sudden that application

160
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,510
unless it can be updated to
the whole world very quickly,

161
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,490
you're gonna have a major problem.

162
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,703
And so therefore certificate stapling,

163
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,600
there's other ways that this has been put,

164
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,400
but essentially the
risk here is hard-coded

165
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,599
public keys within applications.

166
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,330
- Yeah, and it may not be
quote unquote stapling per se.

167
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,039
But I mean, I was just
this morning talking

168
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,040
to a major enterprise who
had hard-coded applications

169
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,810
look for specific details
inside their certs

170
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,670
and those details were changing

171
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,410
and they had to create a roadmap
item to deal with that, so-

172
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,970
- You should consider all
certificates ephemeral, period.

173
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,897
- Yeah, absolutely, that's a big one.

174
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:53,020
And you lose your agility, right?

175
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,820
We're gonna talk about agility,

176
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,960
the ability to change out your certs

177
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,219
and swap out your certs
when unknown events occur

178
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,610
or an unexpected problems occur

179
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,610
is a major part of the robust high uptime

180
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,123
high security contemporary enterprise.

181
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,810
All right, deployment problems.

182
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,940
So those are certificate
problems, deployment problems.

183
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,933
First of all, reuse of
certificates, we see this a bunch.

184
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,330
- Yeah, Tim, so I think
in the public trust world,

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,559
there are examples of, if
you have multiple servers

186
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,990
that are handling a specific domain,

187
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,512
you might be doing a
reuse of a certificate.

188
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,780
I'm not sure if that's the
worst thing in the world

189
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,430
but I will tell you that
one of the big problems

190
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,579
with a reuse of certificate
in the private trust world,

191
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,440
again, is all the automotive industry

192
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,790
had a problem with this
with their key fobs

193
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,790
where there a practice of
using the same certificate

194
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,200
just copies of certificates
in all the different key fobs,

195
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,640
they were not issuing
different certificates.

196
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,199
And so therefore if that
certificate were to be stolen,

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,850
or by some sort of process
especially because the risk there

198
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,070
is the fact that every single certificate

199
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,600
was just within a physical
device that was so easy to steal.

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,270
Unfortunately it caused a
situation where that key fob

201
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,189
could then be used against
a number of targets at once.

202
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,870
Reuse of certificates, not a good idea.

203
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,303
Issue a certificate per destination.

204
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,670
- Yeah, and in an IOT
scenario in particular, right?

205
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,339
One of the problems of
course is oftentimes

206
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,000
there is no replacing that
certificate on the device, right?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
If you revoke the cert,
you break the device.

208
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,500
And so under those circumstances,

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,640
you want granular control, right?

210
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,390
If there were a reason
why I had to get rid of

211
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,230
one cert to break one device,

212
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,060
it'd be a shame if I had to take

213
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,239
10,000 of its closest
friends with it, right?

214
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,970
But that's a real scenario that really

215
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,020
people run into in the real world.

216
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,710
Now on the public trust side, you know?

217
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,510
Certificate reuse this is a tough one

218
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,590
because on the one hand I get your point

219
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,827
and this comes up where people say,

220
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,110
"Look, I have a cluster
and I have to manage this.

221
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,380
And you know, it's
putting an individual cert

222
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,130
on every individual machine or VM

223
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,990
is very difficult for
the following reasons".

224
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,720
Yeah, but what you're doing again

225
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
is you're extending your risk.

226
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,840
In the hypothetical scenario
where there is a search

227
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,050
that needs to be got rid of right now,

228
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,630
or in the hypothetical scenario where

229
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,403
somebody steals a private
key and you don't know it.

230
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,440
If you have it on one machine,
your risk is more limited.

231
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,773
If you have it on 50 machines,
your risk is much broader.

232
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,430
And so that's a problem.

233
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,199
- They call them leaf
certificates for a reason.

234
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
Every leaf should have
a unique identifier.

235
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,740
- Yeah, so it's tough.

236
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,830
I understand the temptation
and probably right now,

237
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,017
some of you in the audience are going,

238
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:01,070
"Well, but you know I
really gotta", I get it.

239
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,950
But you also have to understand that

240
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,940
you are extending your
risk of outage or worse

241
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,860
as the more you raise certificates

242
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,270
the more you're extending that risk.

243
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,370
And so I guess what
we're probably saying is

244
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,130
keep that to a minimum
do it when you must,

245
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,033
don't do it when it's more convenient.

246
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,300
And that's actually kind of a
theme for the next two, right?

247
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,740
Overextension and six and
seven sort of go together.

248
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,190
They're are two flavors of the same thing.

249
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,860
It's overextended use of
a specific certificate.

250
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,680
So just like when I copy a certificate

251
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,410
and put it on multiple machines,

252
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,040
I also can say life is
easier if I use wild cards

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,689
cause they work with more domains.

254
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,800
Or life is easier if I use MDCs

255
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,680
cause I can take the same certificate

256
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,229
and can work with more
domains, and that's important.

257
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,750
They're important tools in the chest,

258
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,500
that's why they're there.

259
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,460
But on the other hand, you
can be too enthusiastic,

260
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,920
in your use of these things
and you can overextend.

261
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,589
- So Tim, a perfect
example that I can think of

262
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,102
from a bad guy's perspective,

263
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,709
wildcards are great if
you're attacking that site

264
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,420
because the ability to create sub-domains

265
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,510
at will is quite easy and-
- Right. (laughing)

266
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,470
- Right, so therefore
convenience to the person...

267
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,550
The convenience factor
to the victim was great.

268
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,310
All of a sudden, it's not very convenient

269
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,569
once you find out that your sites

270
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,050
are being used for phishing.

271
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,959
- Yeah, and also once again,
this extension of risk argument

272
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,920
it's just like reuse is the same.

273
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,012
In the event that there is a problem

274
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:38,540
instead of you losing a more limited

275
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,439
part of my service infrastructure,

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,640
while I deal with the problem I'm losing

277
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,290
a bigger part of my service
infrastructure, right?

278
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,810
More problems, more cascading effects,

279
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,219
more outages, more
customers can't be served,

280
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,420
more employees can't do
what they need to do.

281
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,240
So again, it's like reuse of certificates.

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,270
I know the reasons why people do it.

283
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,579
Those reasons are valid.

284
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,020
Our environments are technically complex,

285
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,742
and at the same time,

286
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,760
just be careful about being lazy about it

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,593
and make sure you're doing it

288
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:14,599
because you must and
not just cause you can.

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,230
- Yeah, well said.

290
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,380
- All right, we're already
hinted at this one.

291
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,950
So automation, a big one was see.

292
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,140
Failure to automate certificate renewal.

293
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,240
So in the public trust world,

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,230
all of your certificates will expire,

295
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,030
the will expire by a certain timeframe

296
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,870
that's not that far away.

297
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,780
Normally the certificates lasts longer

298
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,677
than the services that they serve do

299
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,030
and that means certificates
need to be renewed.

300
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,113
And when they aren't renewed,

301
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,050
there are outages, bad things happen.

302
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,500
A couple of years ago the
O2 data service went down,

303
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,200
O2 SoftBank and other providers went down,

304
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,900
maybe 40 million people were without

305
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,780
phone service for most of the day.

306
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,449
The root cause was an expired certificates

307
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,340
that didn't get renewed.

308
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,240
The Equifax breach that
affected 45% of Americans,

309
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
myself included was enabled

310
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,450
by an expired certificate
that didn't get renewed.

311
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,370
Every year we see high profile outages

312
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,080
from major technology providers,

313
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,300
and major online services that go down.

314
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,859
And the root cause is a certificate
that didn't get renewed.

315
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,690
- The list goes on and on, and
these are not minor players.

316
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,825
We're talking about Microsoft Teams,

317
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,453
- (chuckles) Yes.
- Sony had an outage.

318
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,100
It just, the list goes on and on it.

319
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,850
And it was interesting
Tim as we were waiting

320
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,830
for the first big example of this in 2021,

321
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,530
and we've now seen it as well.

322
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,760
- Yeah, exactly.

323
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,757
so automation of
certificate renewal is key.

324
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:58,594
And again, a lot of us
especially the old timers,

325
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,820
remember once upon a
time where I had a room

326
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,780
with the drop floor and there
were exactly 23 servers in it

327
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,520
and they had to be swapped
out once every two years.

328
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,150
And it was easy to put
things in your calendar,

329
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,770
but that just isn't our world anymore.

330
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,300
And if you're still
trying to do these things

331
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,530
manually with spreadsheets

332
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,390
and are getting more and more complicated,

333
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,319
this is how people get in trouble.

334
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,263
Automation of renewal is so valuable.

335
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,680
- Yes, sir, I'm thinking,

336
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,520
think of the proliferation of web servers,

337
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,630
the proliferation of load balancers

338
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,850
the proliferation of
all the different places

339
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,810
where your certificates are renewing.

340
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,060
That's just in the public trust world,

341
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,790
nevermind the private trust world

342
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,839
where they can be in
hundreds and hundreds,

343
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,530
if not thousands of locations.

344
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,079
This has to be automated now.

345
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,064
It's 2021, it's gonna be 2022 soon enough.

346
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:53,010
We've got, dealing with it by spreadsheet,

347
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,217
we just have to get rid of that.

348
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,130
- And then this ties
into your earlier point

349
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,400
about shorter terms, right?

350
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,410
If you wanna shorten your terms,

351
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,130
then automation becomes all
that much more important, right?

352
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,080
If I take my average, if I take my stats

353
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,920
and I say instead of one year
I'm going down to 90 days,

354
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,610
I just quadrupled the
number of renewables,

355
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,601
right?
- Right Tim.

356
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:14,170
- And (chuckles) so I
better make sure that

357
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm able to deal with that.

358
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,060
The next two also in a
way kind of go together.

359
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,310
So multiple private CA's
so here's the scenario,

360
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,209
somewhere along the line I need a CA,

361
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,050
and so I go and I put something together

362
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,462
and I put it in place I
sat up and I run that.

363
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,600
And then somewhere on the line,

364
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,203
someone else in my organization,

365
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,140
they need some in-house certs.

366
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,850
And so they make their own CA

367
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,720
and et cetera and et cetera.

368
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,750
And suddenly I have all
these CA's out there

369
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,900
and I've all these roots,

370
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,520
and I have all this stuff to be managed.

371
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,840
If I don't get all the right routes

372
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,130
in the right machines
then systems don't work

373
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,100
and it can become an
administration nightmare.

374
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,030
- Tim, here's a pro tip for you,

375
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,990
and for anybody who's watching this.

376
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,830
Every Kubernetes cluster has a CA, right?

377
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,091
Anybody who's doing DevOps,
raise your hands virtually,

378
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,012
(laughing softly)
you have CAs

379
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:05,169
that are proliferating
within your environment

380
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,569
that you may not know about.

381
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,909
You might say to yourself,
"This doesn't apply to me.

382
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,440
I've got a great governance program.

383
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,210
I've got a risk officer
who's obsessed over this".

384
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,750
Yeah, but you probably have a DevOps team

385
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,170
that's creating CA's and
you don't even know it.

386
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,579
- Yeah, absolutely.

387
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,579
And again, the disadvantages
of having multiple CAs

388
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,500
run around, it's less efficient.

389
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,650
it is much harder to maintain,

390
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,740
consistent compliance with
your own government rules.

391
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,920
There's more things you need to look at,

392
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,560
and there are potential,

393
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,399
there's the potential for
systems not to work correctly,

394
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
not to connect to each other correctly

395
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,629
because I was expecting one CA

396
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,280
and I was getting a different CA.

397
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,639
- Tim, I would say, this is an where

398
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,590
we don't often in the PKI industry

399
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,050
talk much more about trust models,

400
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,629
we used to back in the old days.

401
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,570
- Oh yeah, (indistinct)
- But I think

402
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,926
it's gotta come back as a conversation

403
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,449
and that's where going to
the experts really helps,

404
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,840
because we've seen it
all, been there done that.

405
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,409
And there's a sweet
spot for every use case

406
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,780
in every scenario and there's a sweet spot

407
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,490
for the growth that you're gonna have

408
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,040
within your enterprise as well,

409
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,483
especially out to the cloud.

410
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,220
There's dealing now with
extending trust to partners,

411
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,100
multi-vendor ecosystems,

412
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,832
There's ways to determine how
you should structure your CAs.

413
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,480
- Okay, fair enough.

414
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,180
And probably we can't get into that now

415
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,580
but that might make a good
podcast or a future webinar.

416
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,470
And then connected to
that is maintaining an...

417
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,640
Excuse me, an unnecessary Microsoft CA.

418
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,090
So again, what happens here?

419
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,740
What happens here is
I have a Microsoft CA,

420
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,910
I've had it for a long time,

421
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,347
cause I've had windows
servers and windows machines.

422
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:54,347
And by my operating system,

423
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,410
makeup has outgrown that, right?

424
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,360
It's more heterogeneous
than it was at the time

425
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,240
but we still got this old
Microsoft CA sitting around.

426
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,670
That's only good for part
of what it needs to service,

427
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,070
and then we have to
service everything else

428
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,870
with a different CA but we
don't rip out the Microsoft CA

429
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,739
just cause it's kind of always been there.

430
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,860
- Well, Tim, my hair is quickly graying,

431
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,379
and that's just proof that Microsoft CA

432
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,090
has been in my life for a long time,

433
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,139
I've seen a lot of implementations of it.

434
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,799
What used to be a very Microsoft-centric

435
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,949
siloed enterprise environment

436
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,500
has now quickly grown to
be extended to the cloud.

437
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,590
You now have multiple operating systems,

438
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,340
not the least of which is
Android, iOS, et cetera,

439
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,592
on and on and on to
various flavors of Linux.

440
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,870
Mobile device use cases all
these things did not exist

441
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,709
in the heyday of Microsoft
CA and it has not kept up.

442
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,110
And Microsoft has basically left it

443
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,550
to the industry to deal with that.

444
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,550
And so therefore you really
have to question, you know?

445
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,560
Should you be, at the very least,

446
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,000
you probably have to be
augmenting your Microsoft CA.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,250
But on the other hand, are you keeping it

448
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,520
just because it makes
you feel warm and fuzzy.

449
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,820
It's one of these things
where that free CA

450
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,490
has cost you a lot of money over the years

451
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,350
with the difficulty of maintenance.

452
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,669
PKI has moved on.

453
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,610
It's good to look at what's out there

454
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,562
to be able to replace it
or to augment it very well.

455
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,620
- Fair enough, all right.

456
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,469
So the next one security problems.

457
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,110
Good old fashioned things are
security and vulnerabilities

458
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,870
with your certificates and your keys.

459
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,870
So first of all, inadequate
protection of your private keys.

460
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,790
Private keys are what it's all about.

461
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,310
If anybody gets the private
keys, the certs are no good.

462
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,500
So talk to me about this, Jay.

463
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,560
- Sure, Tim, I'll use an example

464
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,560
that's probably very easy to
relate to for most people.

465
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,700
But how many of you know for a fact that

466
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,350
within your organization, your SSH keys,

467
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,101
not necessarily your PKI managed keys,

468
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:23,101
but just your SSH key
pairs are sitting around?

469
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,810
They're just on somebody's file system,

470
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,649
and when you need them you use them.

471
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,320
- In a folder called "Keys".

472
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,643
- In a folder called "Hack Me Now, Here".

473
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:32,593
- (chuckles) Right.

474
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,670
- Unfortunately that's incredibly common.

475
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,740
So if you enter then the
PKI version of that story,

476
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,600
it's exactly the same
scenario which is obviously

477
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,270
for your CA root keys
a private CA scenario.

478
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,723
She'd put in those in an HSM.

479
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,050
But for leaf certificates, for example,

480
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,233
we now have all sorts of
secure elements available,

481
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,082
all Windows 10 laptops come with a TPM.

482
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,810
There are various other form
factors to protect your keys.

483
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,960
So regardless of whether
they're root keys,

484
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,630
or whether they're leaf certificates,

485
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,820
these are things that
in the modern age now,

486
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,740
we can protect these things properly,

487
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,170
and that even includes IOT.

488
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,840
I still see a lot of IOT devices

489
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,899
where the certificates
are stored in software.

490
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,720
There are very cost-effective
secure elements now

491
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,840
for IOT devices where the
certificate can be stored

492
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,370
in a very, very secure location,

493
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,639
isolated from the main kernel,

494
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,260
isolated from user LAN memory.

495
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,570
You gotta check into these things.

496
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,010
- All right, and then patches
and vulnerabilities, right?

497
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,460
Patch management, so, you know?

498
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,020
If you're using a third-party service,

499
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,913
a SaaS service like for
your PKI, for instance,

500
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:58,060
that vendor is going to take care of this.

501
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,070
They're gonna make sure
everything is patched and current.

502
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,870
They're going to make sure that, you know?

503
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,959
They know about the zero days on day zero,

504
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
and that they respond for them.

505
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,050
But if you take it and you
kind of set up your own PKI,

506
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,669
and somebody puts it up and it's running

507
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,200
and everybody forgets it,

508
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,950
and it's sitting in the background,

509
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,000
who's keeping an eye on that?

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,810
Who's making sure that you're current?

511
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,820
Who's making sure that
you don't have holes

512
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,860
that have been discovered
that you could have patched

513
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,419
but you didn't cause
nobody thought about it

514
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,503
or nobody thought it was their job?

515
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,159
- I think it's very common.

516
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,600
And Tim, I remember that during
the last set of overwhelming

517
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,183
difficulties in the industry
for everybody in IT,

518
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,939
there happened to be
also be a patch Tuesday

519
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,300
to patch other things at the time.

520
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,810
And all these things,
unfortunately have to be tested

521
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,679
in a lot of organizations
before the patch is allowed.

522
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,777
And so these dependencies of patching,

523
00:23:55,777 --> 00:24:00,100
leading to long lengths of
vulnerabilities being wide open,

524
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,939
it's a golden age to
be a bad guy right now.

525
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,900
- It is, it is so that's another, again

526
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,660
that's a common one we see a lot.

527
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Governance problems.

528
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,207
So first of all, just good old fashioned,

529
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,200
"Oh, we don't have rules. (chuckles)

530
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,710
We don't have rules for our certificates.

531
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,083
We don't have rules for
PKI, was that a thing?

532
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,650
Now, again, not so much
an issue for public certs.

533
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,817
Although even then you might wanna say,

534
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,720
"Look, we're we're in ECC shop",

535
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,060
or things along those lines,

536
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,629
but in the private PKI world

537
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,606
where you can turn the
levers any way you like,

538
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:40,240
it can we've seen it where
it's just absolute chaos

539
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,810
- Chaos to the point where

540
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,350
if you go back to some
earlier slides, Tim,

541
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,860
SHA-1 certificates aren't
even part of the policy.

542
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,610
So in other words
issuing anything you like

543
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,040
is kind of a possibility

544
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,253
and nobody's got the visibility to it.

545
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,139
So I think we'll be
talking a little bit more

546
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,460
about visibility later but
governance plus visibility

547
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,470
together are incredibly important.

548
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,910
- Yeah, and also remember
that a lot of the people

549
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,120
involved in your organization
are not the PKI experts,

550
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,100
they are expert in something else.

551
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,669
They are great developers perhaps

552
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,320
but they don't know
really anything about PKI.

553
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,540
And so if there aren't
policies for them to follow,

554
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,440
if there isn't a recipe
book that you give them,

555
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,810
then they're forced to try to figure

556
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,440
these things out for themselves.

557
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,570
And they may not be the
best qualified people

558
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,429
in your organization to do that.

559
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,019
- It's hard enough for
a full-time risk officer

560
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:37,770
in a normal size organization to do it.

561
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,840
Nevermind, leave it to people who are-

562
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,673
- Yeah.

563
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,506
- That's not their full-time job.

564
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,720
- Someone who's overworked and busy

565
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,527
and on deadline and supposed
to be doing something else,

566
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,520
and they have an internal customer

567
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,280
who's screaming at them, yes, exactly.

568
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,210
CPS problems, so once again,

569
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,580
is there a CPS, do you know what it says?

570
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,755
Where did it come from?

571
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,220
Was any consideration built into it?

572
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,773
These are all legitimate questions.

573
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,130
- The big question to me Tim, is

574
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,680
did it lock you into something

575
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,113
that doesn't grow with you?

576
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,610
And that, again, something I said earlier,

577
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,610
which is talk to the
experts because CPS papers

578
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,650
can be written in such a way that

579
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,460
it won't lock you in or
paint you into a corner

580
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,192
for future considerations, I
think that's very important.

581
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:33,240
This is an area where even I don't claim

582
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,120
to be an expert, Tim.

583
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,300
And I've been around this
industry over 20 years,

584
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,810
there are specialists in this that

585
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,040
you really need to talk
to to make sure that

586
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,930
you don't have CPS problems.

587
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,740
- Right, and we do have certainly

588
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,720
our share of them here at Sectigo.

589
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,360
It's just not you and I Jay,

590
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,233
because we focus on different things.

591
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,930
Revocation checking.

592
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,853
We've already talked about revocation.

593
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,100
Revocation, checking doesn't help

594
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,399
or revocation doesn't help

595
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,913
if you don't know if
a CERT's been revoked.

596
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,310
- Yeah, I would say there are some

597
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,090
use cases in IOT, for example,

598
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,290
where revocation isn't even possible.

599
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,854
Therefore you have to make the decision

600
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:21,670
of having very low term
links for your certificates,

601
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,460
we talked about that earlier.

602
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,220
But certainly verification checking in,

603
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,310
especially in private trust,

604
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,919
if you're not checking those certificates,

605
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,700
they're essentially
long lived certificates.

606
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,000
And therefore that term
problem we talked about earlier

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,700
it becomes the equivalent problem.

608
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,603
- Yeah, I don't have
anything to add to that.

609
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,110
And then the public private certificate,

610
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,560
these two, again, 16 and
17 kind of go together.

611
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,919
Public certs and private certs,

612
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,920
they have their own
individual advantages, right?

613
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,909
Public certs are essential for certain

614
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,240
interoperability scenarios
where there's just

615
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,330
no other way or for services that

616
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,899
reach outside of your own walled garden.

617
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,360
Private certs though,
can be much better assets

618
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,379
when you're confident that you
can stay in the walled garden

619
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,990
cause they give you more
freedom and more control.

620
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,990
And people don't always think about

621
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,990
which one is preferable,

622
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,670
rather they just do what they're used to.

623
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,580
Do what they did last time.

624
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,710
Do what's more convenient,
do what's more available.

625
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,503
That that's one of the
things we definitely see.

626
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,379
- Yeah, Tim, I would say,

627
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,120
I think the real quick
rule of thumb here is

628
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,003
if your use case utilizes
a web browser of any kind,

629
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,980
public certs might be a good idea

630
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,590
in order to be able to
avoid error messages,

631
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,149
warning messages within the browser.

632
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,663
For every other use case,

633
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,010
the public trust is kind of a misnomer

634
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,870
because a lot of times
when you might think

635
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,669
you might need a public trusts,

636
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,533
what you really need is a trust model

637
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:19,533
that effectively allows
a multi-vendor ecosystem.

638
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,950
And so you think of it
more like a walled garden

639
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,033
for multiple vendors and that
could be hundreds of vendors.

640
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,439
Hundreds of organizations,
hundreds of partners,

641
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,340
but not necessarily public.

642
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,679
- Yeah, we just, on our podcasts,

643
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,630
we just had a guest the Chairman
of the SunSpec Alliance,

644
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,010
which is a clean energy consortium.

645
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,760
And he talked about how there are hundreds

646
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,420
of technology providers inside
of that single ecosystem,

647
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,460
and they all have to be interoperable.

648
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,130
And so that's where, you know?

649
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,240
If you have to use private certs,

650
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,710
that's where you need to make sure that

651
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,320
you give this stuff some
very careful thought.

652
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,270
And that's again, where
you should ask yourself

653
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,143
if public certs is perhaps
the way you have to go.

654
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,380
- It's pretty black and white,

655
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,232
but Tom gave a really good podcast.

656
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,180
That's one worth listening to, for sure.

657
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,450
- Yeah, for sure,

658
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,010
All right, problems with visibility.

659
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,980
And by the way, you'll
see 21 is the last number.

660
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,510
So this is the last of our five sections.

661
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay, and again, this two kind of,

662
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,770
first who kind of go together.

663
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,210
Rogue certificates.

664
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,830
What we mean by rogue certificates is

665
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,020
somewhere in the organization,

666
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,810
someone is working on a
project that is being financed

667
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,820
by some kind of internal customer.

668
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,810
Let's say it's a marketing department.

669
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,697
The marketing department says,

670
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,919
"I have an idea for a great new service.

671
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,360
We're gonna do really well with this,

672
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
we're gonna sell lots and lots of stuff".

673
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,370
And they go out and they
hire a development firm,

674
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,929
and the development firm
puts things together,

675
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,290
and they look at it and saw great,

676
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,123
and they standard up.

677
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,220
And one of the things those
guys do is they go buy certs.

678
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,770
So they buy some on your
certs and they slam it in,

679
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,210
and you stand up to your
service and you're a genius

680
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,150
and it's hugely successful.

681
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,990
And so 365 days later
this is an essential part

682
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,233
of our revenue stream, and
one day it's not working,

683
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,320
and people are panicked and
people are in trouble, why?

684
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,770
Because there were some
certificates that nobody knew about

685
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,770
that never were on the roadmap

686
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,770
or never visible to the
office of the CIO or the CISO,

687
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,060
and suddenly bang, things are down,

688
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,293
and people don't know why
and this happens a lot.

689
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,940
- I would say, Tim, you know?

690
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,600
A lot of customers will
initiate certificate discovery,

691
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,620
which is a modern
capability of a good PKI.

692
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,453
- Right.

693
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,480
- And they'll run it at the beginning

694
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,940
and then they think, well, I've got it.

695
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,770
That's it, we're good.

696
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,860
I think what you've just argued is that

697
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,830
it might be a good idea
to do it periodically

698
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,929
- Yeah.
- To see whether or not

699
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,960
some rogue certificates have shown up

700
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,940
within your organization
cause it is a possibility.

701
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,710
- Rogue certificates
creep in all the time,

702
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,300
and when they do go, you have outages.

703
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,750
And by the way, there are other scenarios

704
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,260
like an MNA scenario, right?

705
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,129
I acquire a company, how do I know that

706
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,740
I know about all the certificates

707
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,030
in the company I acquired, right?

708
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,350
And I just spent a bunch
of my hard-earned money

709
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,439
for their revenue stream.

710
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,930
I don't want that revenue stream breaking

711
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,980
because certificates expired.

712
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,210
So yeah, rogue certificates.

713
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,520
I think we understand that
scenario a little more,

714
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,870
but there's also a rogue CA scenario

715
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,280
where the exact same thing happens

716
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,830
but it happens with an entire CA

717
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,663
and all of its leaf certificates.

718
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,600
- Tim, I think I mentioned earlier,

719
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,600
the visibility problem of
Kubernetes clusters having CAs,

720
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,919
if unless those are part
of your governance program,

721
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,683
unless you know what
CA's are being issued,

722
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,180
what's their key links
if they're being revoked,

723
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,320
what are the policies?

724
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,270
Then I would consider
those to be rogue CAs.

725
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,220
And I guarantee, this is
number 19 on the list,

726
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,588
but this may be number one

727
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,480
(laughing)
on your homework list today.

728
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,960
- Right, we'll get to your homework list.

729
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,410
Yeah, so exactly.

730
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,660
And once again, you know?

731
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,660
This could happen through
internal Skunkworks projects.

732
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,649
This could happen through, you know?

733
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,680
A diversified set of internal customers

734
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
off using their own development teams,

735
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,410
or their outside development firms.

736
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,260
This could happen through MNA,

737
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,550
these are all scenarios
where this can occur.

738
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,070
And I'm growing and I'm
standing up new machines

739
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,230
and they're not working,

740
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,570
and I don't know why they're not working.

741
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,169
And it turns out at the end of the day,

742
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,360
they're looking for a route that

743
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,439
I didn't know existed, right?

744
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,383
So that's a real thing, we see it.

745
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,690
Future use case planning.

746
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,530
Yeah, there's a lot of here and now

747
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,980
in people thinking about
digital certificates

748
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,960
and CA's and PKI rather than asking

749
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,743
what do I need to look like
in a year or five years?

750
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:16,900
- Hey, I'm setting up a Microsoft CA,

751
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,460
because 100% of my employees
at this very moment

752
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,850
log into things that are
connected to active directory.

753
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,252
Hallelujah, I'm good to go.

754
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,389
Fast forward to today,
you now have the cloud.

755
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,270
You now have operating systems

756
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,620
that have nothing to do
with Microsoft Stack.

757
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,750
You now have burgeoning technologies

758
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,300
that are all over the place, distributed,

759
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,634
not Microsoft operating system

760
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:43,719
and you didn't plan for any of it.

761
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,719
And that's the story of the
near past but I guarantee

762
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,750
the same kind of mistakes
are happening today

763
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,300
because the future is only
gonna blossom that much more.

764
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,920
The proliferation of
technologies in the near future

765
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,209
will be more than we've ever seen.

766
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:02,180
Are you planning for those unknowns?

767
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,770
- Right, your environments
are gonna get more complex.

768
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,460
Repatriation is gonna become more common,

769
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,450
the total number of systems
involved is going to go up.

770
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,169
The amount of DevOps is gonna go up,

771
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,150
the role played by mobile
devices is going to go up.

772
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,380
All of this is just going to
make things more complicated.

773
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,080
- Are you gonna extend trust
to partners in the future?

774
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,980
Are you gonna be dealing with
the multi-vendor ecosystem?

775
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,500
Are you gonna have trust models
that did not exist today?

776
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,520
Are you going to split product lines?

777
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,880
Are you gonna do MNA's in the future?

778
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,730
All of these things
are extremely important

779
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,830
when thinking about trust models
that you're building today

780
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,220
and technologies and trust models

781
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,730
that you're gonna wanna
be using in the future.

782
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,370
Don't paint yourself into a corner.

783
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,900
- Yeah, absolutely.

784
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,300
I mean, it's funny you just
brought up the MNA one,

785
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,470
that's such an interesting thing.

786
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,990
Like sometimes when somebody
has to spin off a business,

787
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,939
all right, we're gonna...

788
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,020
We're keeping this but
we're gonna take this part

789
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,980
and we're gonna carve it off

790
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,500
and we're (chuckles) gonna
sell it to someone else.

791
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,400
And disentanglement there
becomes really, really hard

792
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,260
especially if it turns out things like,

793
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,840
well they're all part
of the same (chuckles)

794
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,490
CA infrastructure and
suddenly they can't be, right?

795
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,020
So for sure, failure to stay
current on cryptography.

796
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,520
We kind of referenced this one early on

797
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,340
but crypto is changing.

798
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,230
For example, I mentioned
earlier, you know?

799
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,210
Quantum computers are
probably going to render,

800
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,340
are soon to render RSA and ECC obsolete.

801
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,640
We're gonna have to go
to completely different

802
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:36,740
crypto, right?

803
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,189
And completely different cipher suites.

804
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,877
And so if you are running your own PKI,

805
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,810
you're taking on an obligation to know

806
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,259
what is cryptographically sound

807
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,313
and what is not and staying current.

808
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,140
- Again, for the homework list,

809
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,140
it is time to get your
hands dirty in 2021, 2022,

810
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,997
on to quantum safe certificates
and on hybrid certificates

811
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:07,629
which will help the agility

812
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,360
of moving forward into that world.

813
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,160
It is time to get your
hands dirty with that now.

814
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,660
And that's something we can help you with.

815
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,470
- Absolutely.,we're happy
to help you with it.

816
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,350
So the final point, so
that's it, that's the 21.

817
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,319
So what are you gonna do?

818
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,350
So what are you gonna do now?

819
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,740
You have this presentation
it's also available recorded,

820
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,729
so you can go back and look at it again.

821
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,050
This is what we recommend you do.

822
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,080
First of all is review this list.

823
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,220
Go back and look down the list of 21.

824
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,370
That's why we gave you a specific
list, why we organized it.

825
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,359
And think about which one of these

826
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,100
potentially applies to your organization.

827
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,950
And then we suggest
that you make a project

828
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,359
where you go to your internal SMEs,

829
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,910
and have them evaluate your practices

830
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,700
in light of these common pitfalls.

831
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,756
So you can identify things
the easy way and fix them,

832
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,770
before you identify them the hard way

833
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,030
when stuff stops working.

834
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,710
And this is something you can go do,

835
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,603
you can go work on right now.

836
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,339
- Well said to Tim.

837
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,190
- So we did mention,
allude a couple of times,

838
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,240
Jay and I do run a popular podcast,

839
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,930
focused on the PKI and security space.

840
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,685
It is called "Root Causes".

841
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:23,050
You can find it on SoundCloud, Spotify,

842
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,470
iTunes, and a bunch of other places

843
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,759
where you may listen to podcasts.

844
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,580
Just search for Root Causes
PKI, and it'll come up.

845
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,190
You can also just find episodes

846
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,160
directly on the Sectigo website.

847
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,600
We have recorded more than 150 episodes,

848
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,060
and we cover all kinds of matters;

849
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,340
digital certificates,
PKI and related topics.

850
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,793
And we would love to have you join us.

851
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,630
So with that, I think I will
thank you for your time.

852
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,910
We've been answering questions

853
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,540
and chat throughout the session.

854
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,029
And if there are more questions,

855
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,270
we will continue to
answer them, thank you.

856
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,103
- Thank you.
