(music)

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,710
- Hello. I'm Vasu Jakkal.

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,860
We are in an era of accelerated
digital transformation

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,419
and rapid advances in technology.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,630
It's exciting.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,450
I'm hopeful to see what amazing things

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,780
people are able to accomplish
together to technology

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,840
and how technology can
empower us to achieve more

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,180
and live our purpose and our best lives.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,650
But it also means that
we as business leaders

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,500
and security professionals
must be even more focused

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,950
on building and preserving trust

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,010
and mindful of the
timeless value of privacy.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,260
Now that's not an easy task.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,739
The COVID-19 pandemic has
brought on dramatic changes

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,960
in digital activity.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,080
Remote and hybrid work has increased

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,900
by more than 300% over
pre-pandemic levels.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,370
And today people are
moving more fluidly online

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,020
between business and personal activity

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,429
thanks to technologies that
are increasingly entwined

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,030
in every single aspect
of our daily routines.

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,700
This means more personal
and sensitive information

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,710
is being generated and shared

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,339
across a wider area of devices and clouds.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,920
Now compounding this challenge
for security professionals

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,910
is this evolving cybersecurity landscape

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,369
that puts data at risk.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,770
Today we are seeing a new
wave of advanced attacks

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,080
that are more sophisticated,
more destructive

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,630
and more difficult to
detect than ever before.

32
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,449
The collective result is
growing concern about trust

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,020
in the technologies and organizations

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,110
that handle personal and sensitive data.

35
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,260
Now more than ever before

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,610
people are thinking about
organizations they interact with

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,490
and asking themselves, is my data secure?

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,280
Is it being handled properly with care,

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,450
and in accordance with the
laws governing its use?

40
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,209
And ultimately, who do
I trust with my data?

41
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,600
Now that's an important question

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,280
because trust will likely
be a defining characteristic

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,180
of business success in the next decade,

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,480
in this decade, and more.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,130
As security professionals

46
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,890
creating a better and safer world for all

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,070
now requires us to think
about security and privacy

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,590
in an interconnected
and comprehensive way.

49
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,590
For many, privacy is a relatively
new area of responsibility

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,700
and one that's garnering
increasing visibility.

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,589
So let's begin by taking a look

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,343
at what do we mean by privacy protection?

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,730
There are two primary components.

54
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,000
One, data protection,

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,290
which means protecting personal
and organizational data

56
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,239
from any unauthorized third party access

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,800
or malicious attacks and
exploitation of data.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,290
Now, this is certainly core

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,670
to the role of security professionals

60
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,540
including things like
access control management

61
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,113
data classification and encryption.

62
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,040
Second, data privacy
is the proper handling,

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,040
processing, storage and usage
of personal information.

64
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,530
What is interesting is that
the proper handling of data

65
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,070
is now becoming an important part

66
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,450
of the security teams function.

67
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,820
Today, more organizations
are working to ensure

68
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,220
that employees are
trained and knowledgeable

69
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,660
about privacy, risks and requirements,

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,750
especially those who
are directly responsible

71
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,867
for an organization's
data and keeping it safe.

72
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:56,530
In fact, increasingly
security professionals

73
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,910
are ranking data, privacy and governance

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,740
as a key part of their role

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,360
on par with assessing and managing risks

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560
and analyzing and responding to threats.

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,380
Isn't that interesting?

78
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,690
What this means

79
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,730
is that along with the
traditional security functions

80
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,869
privacy has become a core
competency for many teams.

81
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,950
They're responsible,

82
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,800
not only for keeping
unauthorized people out

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,590
but also for partnering with privacy teams

84
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,683
to ensure those who are
authorized to have access to data

85
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,483
will handle it properly.

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,723
Today, privacy matters more than ever.

87
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,300
It's no surprise that privacy is becoming

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,070
a top of mind issue for
organizations of all sizes.

89
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,040
And in turn for security professionals

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,053
who are charged with data protection.

91
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,450
Data has become a
cornerstone of innovation,

92
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,550
of economic growth, and
of societal advancement.

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,040
For many organizations,

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,020
it is their most valuable asset

95
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,049
but data generation has led in some cases

96
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,330
to excessive data collection,
ineffective security

97
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,248
and undisclosed sharing,

98
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,790
all of which puts organizations at risk.

99
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,850
In a YouGov survey
commissioned by Microsoft.

100
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,610
90% of the people surveyed

101
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,470
said they're concerned about
sharing their information.

102
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,820
Current data also shows

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,390
that consumers are making
purchasing decisions

104
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,659
based on trust and that
they would stop buying

105
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,480
from a company or using a
service due to privacy concerns.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,700
In many organizations, privacy
is now a board level issue.

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,380
Both are recognizing that
in a post pandemic world,

108
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,430
organization obligations
and risks around privacy,

109
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,140
data protection, security and compliance

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,469
are greater than ever before.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,410
And quite truthfully more complex.

112
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,500
Today the protection of
privacy is a balancing act,

113
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,373
a shared responsibility
between government,

114
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:58,373
individuals and organizations.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Each must respect and protect privacy.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,890
And each has a very important role to play

117
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,063
in its preservation.

118
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,570
Gartner, an analyst firm,

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,570
estimates that by 2023, 65%
of the world's population

120
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,770
will have its personal data covered

121
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,500
under modern privacy regulations,

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,230
up from 10% in 2020.

123
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,100
That's great news!

124
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,920
More countries around the world

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,600
are introducing modern privacy laws.

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,860
That's the parody to the GDPR

127
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,270
which has now become the
defacto global standard.

128
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,370
In the U S there's an urgent
need to modernize privacy laws

129
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,200
to better protect people

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,563
and help ensure trust in technology.

131
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,320
We at Microsoft have long
been vocal proponents

132
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,460
of national privacy laws

133
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,549
and are encouraged by state efforts

134
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,990
such as those in Virginia,
California, and Washington

135
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,700
that extend data protection
rights to people in the U.S.

136
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,920
and still there's more
to do because today,

137
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,260
particularly in the U.S.,

138
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,150
prevailing practices place the
vast bulk of responsibility

139
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,489
for privacy protections on individuals.

140
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,450
Now, although this approach complies

141
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,789
with the current U.S. law,

142
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,773
it seems almost perfectly
designed to undermine trust.

143
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,462
The large number of websites, devices,

144
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:25,250
apps that people rely
on to remain connected

145
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,100
and engaged makes it nearly impossible

146
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,220
for individuals to navigate the
privacy information overload

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,153
and make informed decisions
about how the data is used.

148
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,290
So where do organizations
come into the equation

149
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,890
and what is their role in
the protection of privacy?

150
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,250
On a most basic level,

151
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,560
organizations must adhere
to all laws and regulations

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,990
and be accountable for
the data they handle

153
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,780
which is why compliance
is such a critical part

154
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,573
of a strong security posture.

155
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,750
But at Microsoft, we also believe

156
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,270
that there are some
fundamental protections

157
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,960
that organizations are uniquely
in a position to enable.

158
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,239
We spend a lot of time
thinking about privacy

159
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,450
because we ourselves sit at the center

160
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,150
of the data ecosystem,

161
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,000
servicing millions of companies

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,120
and helping to enable strong privacy

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,440
operations for customers.

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,900
As defenders of people and data,

165
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,549
we believe in building
upon legal protections

166
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,130
with an approach that fosters
trust and empowerment.

167
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,919
Now, here are three critical
areas for your consideration.

168
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,929
First is user control and transparency.

169
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,030
We believe in giving users control

170
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,839
of the information they share

171
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,490
and providing meaningful
choices and how it is used.

172
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,020
We think that organizations
should be transparent

173
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,630
about the data they
use and how they use it

174
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,350
so consumers of their
products and services

175
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,490
can make informed choices
about what they wish to share.

176
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,070
Second is data security.

177
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,640
We believe that organizations
have a responsibility

178
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,500
to rigorously protect
and encrypt personal data

179
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,270
at every single stage of
its collection or handling.

180
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,870
And this extends to data loss prevention

181
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,520
from both internal and external threats.

182
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,780
Often when organizations
think of data loss prevention

183
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,500
they are thinking of security solutions

184
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,420
that protect against outsiders getting in.

185
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,089
That's important, but
comprehensive security

186
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,650
also requires organizations

187
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,560
to have an inside out approach

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,770
that protects against intentional
or unintentional data loss

189
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,043
from insider threats.

190
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,849
Third, and finally, we believe
in defending privacy for all.

191
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,200
We believe that organizations
bear a responsibility

192
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,100
to legally defend the choices users make

193
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,520
about what they wish to share,
and also to continue to fight

194
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,670
for stronger privacy protections

195
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,233
in their own communities
and around the world.

196
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,630
After all, these protections
benefit everyone.

197
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,146
In addition to engendering

198
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,459
greater customer trust and loyalty,

199
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,300
strong privacy laws provide
customers and companies

200
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,040
with clear guard rails
about how they can use data

201
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,033
for responsible innovation
with greater assurance.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,580
So with all of this in mind

203
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,670
how can security teams build
a comprehensive posture

204
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,069
and not only address data security

205
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,140
but also protect privacy

206
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:24,000
and ensure that an organization

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,513
is meeting its regulatory requirements?

208
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,380
At Microsoft, we are passionate
proponents of zero trust

209
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,210
as a framework for security
and privacy protection.

210
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,330
Verify explicitly, grant
least privileged access

211
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,350
and always, always assume breach.

212
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,130
And we think of zero trust
as not only the practice

213
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,010
of protecting against outside in threats

214
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,290
but also protecting from the inside out.

215
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,270
Addressing the area of compliance

216
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,449
includes managing risks
related to data and privacy

217
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,950
in order to help organizations
implement strong security

218
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,490
and privacy protections across
the entire digital estate.

219
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,260
Now, the great news is that
today security teams have access

220
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,950
to more security compliance management

221
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,320
and identity tools for protecting
privacy than ever before.

222
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,420
From protection and governance,
for identities and data

223
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,520
to insider risk protection,
data loss prevention

224
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
and risk management.

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,460
Investments in these
tools and technologies

226
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,160
not only reduced risks associated
with privacy and data loss

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,439
they can also help to
drive business growth.

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,370
Industry studies show that
companies are realizing

229
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,320
a meaningful return on privacy investment

230
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,530
and that users are increasingly
recognizing privacy

231
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,020
as a differentiator

232
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,040
and showing preference to those companies

233
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,943
that demonstrate trustworthiness.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,390
Security teams may also want to consider

235
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,050
investments in organization-wide,
privacy training

236
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,943
and the proper handling of data.

237
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
These skills are particularly critical

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,590
for employees who handle
personal or sensitive information

239
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,913
or are authorized to have access to it.

240
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,439
The bottom line

241
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,070
is that there are a
growing number of tools,

242
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,520
resources, and expertise
available to you today

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,833
that can help guide you
through this journey.

244
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,580
I, for one, am inspired every single day

245
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,770
by those organizations, including my own

246
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,540
that are taking a leadership role

247
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,569
in the protection of privacy.

248
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,430
It is a right worth fighting for

249
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,770
because one of the things
we know for certain

250
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,780
is that empowerment begins with trust.

251
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,260
For all of us to feel
empowered, to innovate,

252
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,240
create and solve problems,

253
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,010
we need to feel safe and be safe.

254
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,640
We must be able to trust

255
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,110
in the security of the
technologies we've come to rely on

256
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,580
and in the companies we interact with.

257
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,210
We have to be able to trust

258
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,450
that our privacy and
confidentiality will be protected

259
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,410
across everything we do,

260
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,010
and that our data will be used

261
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,343
only in a way that is consistent
with our expectations.

262
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,569
Safeguarding privacy,
with purpose and passion

263
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,810
empowers people and organizations

264
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,469
in every community around
the world to do more.

265
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,350
So let's inspire and let's be inspired.

266
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,313
Thank you for watching and
enjoy the RSA conference.
