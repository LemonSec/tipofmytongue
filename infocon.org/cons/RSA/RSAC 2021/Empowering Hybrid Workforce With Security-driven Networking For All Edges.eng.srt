00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,800
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome, my name is Nirav Shah,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,870
I'm a Vice President of Product
and Solution at Fortinet.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,057
I'm responsible for SD-WAN, SASE,

5
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,820
and many network firewall
related solution.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,163
What we call Security-driven Networking.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,940
And today I'm really excited to talk about

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,210
how the hybrid workforce
that we are all going through

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,120
working remotely, some of
us going back to office

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,320
and what kind of challenges
we are seeing in the market.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
How this convergence of
networking and security

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,970
becomes the most important
thing as we move forward

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,390
to provide a consistent security

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,330
and a better user experience

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,730
regardless of where your
users are working from.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,992
So let's start off talking
about the digital innovations.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,140
No matter in which
industry you are working

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,770
or your catering for customers,

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,590
there are many business-critical
trends which are evolving

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,533
for which you need to
change your infrastructure.

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,110
Some of you have seen the
growth of cloud applications,

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,110
IoT devices, the use of 5G and
compute, but at the same time

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,310
in last 12 to 18 months, working remotely

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,220
have accelerated how
the digital innovations

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,263
needs to be adopted.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,560
But at the same time, the ability for you

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,810
to provide a better user
experience for your users,

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,050
for cloud application for IoT devices

29
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,963
and using the connectivity like 5G.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
While all of this sounds very exciting

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,460
what's happening is because of this change

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,070
in infrastructure the
overall attack surface

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,413
is also expanding.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,270
The hackers are taking advantage of it.

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,500
We have seen in one minute
over five million plus attacks

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,550
that we are stopping.

37
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,929
So the balance between
the digital innovation

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,530
and providing a good
security, a solid security,

39
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,440
is the foundation principle

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,032
as we move forward 2021 and beyond.

41
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,109
I wanna talk about the few innovations,

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,110
few survey points that we saw
in last two to three months.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,880
I talked about multi-cloud adoption,

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,150
over 93% of customers like yourself

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,903
have already started a
multi-cloud strategy.

46
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,810
But more importantly, this work
from anywhere I talked about

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,470
hybrid workforce, IDC just reported that

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,470
over 72% of customers will
remain hybrid workforce.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,470
So the way your hybrid workforce

50
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,570
are going to access this
multi cloud application

51
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,803
is going to be extremely important.

52
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,900
But also, as you can see here,

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,600
over 70% of customers are
saying that their users

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,910
are not getting the user
experience they need.

55
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,133
And that is hampering their productivity.

56
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,970
So as you can see all
the digital innovation,

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,359
the changes in the infrastructure,

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,570
the need for multi-cloud
adoption, that all sound good,

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,959
but if there is a lack of security,

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,460
if there is a lack of user experience,

61
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,180
then your users, your customers
are not getting the services

62
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,873
that what is required to be
productive to be successful.

63
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,643
And I'm sure you must be
thinking, why is that happening?

64
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,270
Now, let's take a step back

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,220
and think about the legacy
network architecture.

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,950
What I'm showing you here
is something many of us

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,209
have deployed, used over
the last two decades.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,850
And of course, there is a reason

69
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,700
that your own network branch, your edges,

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,060
are always connected to the data center.

71
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,440
And then you're sending your traffic out

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,740
to the public cloud, private
cloud SaaS application.

73
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,260
This has worked well,

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,750
because of that spoke to hub architecture,

75
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,093
making sure security inspection
is done at the data center.

76
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,530
But now, as you saw in last two slides,

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,110
applications are not in data center.

78
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,820
Many of your applications
are actually in cloud

79
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,630
or in SaaS applications.

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,920
So the shift of how they're
accessing application

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,880
becomes extremely important

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,633
and this architecture is not efficient.

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,719
At the same time, remote users
right working from anywhere

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,190
that all of us are experiencing,

85
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,810
we cannot have users using
VPN going to the data center

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,760
and then accessing application.

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,670
In fact, we have seen many of the users

88
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,860
have seen issues with that
because of the user experience,

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,030
and they oftentimes go directly
out to the SaaS application

90
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,373
which in fact put even higher
risk of a security posture.

91
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,340
So three things, this
architecture is not giving you

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,330
this consistent security, it
is creating the security gaps

93
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,150
for the mobile workforce and
that user experience issue

94
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,073
remains there.

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,050
Another reason why this
change of digital innovation,

96
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,300
working from anywhere require a shift

97
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,900
to how your edges are deployed,

98
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,620
how you need to use a platform approach

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,600
rather than a point product

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,910
and make sure there's a consistent policy,

101
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,453
there's a consistent security.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,953
Let's talk about the explosion of edges.

103
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,320
I touched upon how the legacy
architecture is changing.

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,063
This is an example of that.

105
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,650
In the past, it was all
about network edges,

106
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,870
and they consuming application
in the data center.

107
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,220
Today, it's all about users.

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,690
It's all about the devices
that users are using

109
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,163
and application that users are consuming.

110
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,903
And as you see this kind
of architecture shift,

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,133
the network edges are everywhere.

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,020
Yes, Branch and Campus
were the dominant edges

113
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,530
that we have seen in last 10 years.

114
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,900
But now working from anywhere

115
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,233
means there's branch of
one user almost everywhere.

116
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,350
This is a home edge or a coffee shop edge,

117
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,840
or some of the users are
crawling and still walking.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,840
So, the way users are going
through network edges,

119
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,260
and accessing those different applications

120
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm showing on the right side

121
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,253
needs a complete different transformation.

122
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,340
Today what we have seen is, in
this different network edges,

123
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,690
they have different vendors,
different point product,

124
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,913
the management has a different console,

125
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,880
inconsistent policy,
inconsistent security,

126
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,280
is creating a lot of complexity.

127
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,919
It is increasing a cost for you to manage

128
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,600
and still your users are not
getting their experience.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,700
This is where again, this
explosion of edges is important,

130
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,800
but providing that consistent
security, user experience,

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,910
and keeping users at the focal point

132
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,790
is the most important
thing that we need to think

133
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,483
as we shift our architecture.

134
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,420
And as all of us have seen,
while we talk about edges,

135
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,420
while we talk about users,
the speed of cyber threats,

136
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,849
how hackers have made a more complex

137
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,870
and sophisticated technologies
to increase attack

138
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,917
has continuously increasing.

139
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,159
As you can see from my screen
side, for the left side,

140
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,433
I'm showing a SolarWind attack
that many of us are aware of.

141
00:07:57,287 --> 00:08:01,469
But as you go from left
to right, on the delivery,

142
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,070
how the attacks are installed

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,920
and then the command in
control, management of those,

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,540
these attacks are becoming more deeper

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,883
and more sophisticated.

146
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,550
It's important for a technology
that is securing your edge

147
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,290
is also to provide a
much faster resolution

148
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,690
and detect those threats

149
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,810
so that we can provide
this better security,

150
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,309
but also stop the lateral
movement of threats.

151
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,030
This is why it's not just about the speed

152
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,150
your users are connecting to application,

153
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,819
it's also about the speed,
how we can make sure to stop

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,230
the threats, the hacks,
that as I mentioned,

155
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,680
at Fortinet using the
FortiGuard Labs we have seen

156
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,319
in one minute over five
million plus web attacks

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,370
that we are stopping.

158
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,960
What this all leads to is we
cannot have the point products

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,490
at different ages,

160
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,490
there needs to be a comprehensive
cybersecurity platform.

161
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,550
And the evolution of platform
is actually happening

162
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,449
for last many years.

163
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,500
But let's talk about what we have seen.

164
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,100
If you take the last 20
years of of time span,

165
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,100
starting 2000 to 2010,
we have seen the firewall

166
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,330
and antivirus was the main focus.

167
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,550
And then we saw the next 10
years how firewall shifted

168
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,300
to a content inspection next
generation firewall, or UTM.

169
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
And then antivirus shifted more
towards Endpoint Protection,

170
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,713
applications to the data
center connectivity.

171
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,860
This is what well right, shift from an IP

172
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,410
to more of an application level.

173
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,300
But then we again saw
in the next 10 years,

174
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,910
the shift from data center to cloud,

175
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,530
shift from a content inspection

176
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,703
to a much more sophisticated edge-based,

177
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,740
cloud-based security, and
then endpoint protection

178
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,220
to endpoint detection, and
Zero Trust Network Access.

179
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,220
But today, most of the
customers we talked to

180
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,740
are not just looking
for this point products

181
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,573
on the left side, they're
looking for a platform,

182
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,310
which has all of this
attack surface covered,

183
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,089
it has the most sophisticated
enterprise certified security,

184
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,340
threat intelligence, and
has an identity of users

185
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,203
to provide an explicit access.

186
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,130
This is where the platform
is the most important way

187
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,003
for you to shift that architecture.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,530
And what we recommend is,

189
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,329
as you go towards the platform strategy,

190
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,173
you need to have three pillars
of your security posture.

191
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,670
Oftentimes, we hear that your
networking and security team

192
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,709
are working in a silo,

193
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,070
this is a great opportunity for you

194
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,680
to bring the networking
and security team together,

195
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,959
converge them, while we are
also converging the technology.

196
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,260
Have the Security-driven
Networking approach,

197
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,319
whether it's an SD-WAN,
whether it's an SD-branch,

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,253
all of those solution needs
to be security-driven.

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,750
And then going to the Zero Trust Access.

200
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,810
Make sure what is on your network,

201
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,739
are you getting the visibility?

202
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,189
Are you able to control
what users are accessing

203
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,510
which applications

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,010
and having that user base
explicit access approach

205
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,439
makes it easier for you to provide

206
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,893
the security for users and experience.

207
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,729
And of course, the third
is Adaptive Cloud Security.

208
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,700
Yes, your applications
are moving to cloud.

209
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes, it's important for you
to provide a consistent,

210
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,260
more granular application,
but at the same time,

211
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,610
securing the workload,
securing the application,

212
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,463
providing the compliance,
is equally important.

213
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,699
So these three pillars
is what you can apply

214
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,020
and make your strategy towards
Security-driven Networking

215
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,773
to Zero Trust Access to
Adaptive Cloud Security.

216
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,680
And again, as you're doing
this, three different pillar

217
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,060
and having an enterprise
grade threat intelligence,

218
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,760
what makes it easier for you to stop

219
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,963
that most sophisticated threats.

220
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,229
Building a threat
intelligence is not easy.

221
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,670
We need to have an artificial intelligence

222
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,760
machine-learnings where we
are accessing billions of data

223
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,710
and then stopping those millions
of threats I talked about.

224
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,700
The same time you need to have telemetry,

225
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,910
so we are getting this
information from a network,

226
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,189
from a sandbox, from an endpoint,

227
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,820
and have a trusted partnership,

228
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,910
we are able to detect and
stop those Zero-Day threats.

229
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,439
And then on the right side,

230
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,820
we can provide that
security updates instantly

231
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,990
for users, for edges, and for cloud.

232
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,610
So as you can see, it's
about the visibility,

233
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,040
it's about the innovations

234
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,670
of how this threat intelligence is done

235
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,319
and then putting an action on top of it.

236
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,670
When you combine this
within platform approach,

237
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,130
this is where you can see
how this architecture shift

238
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,150
is giving you the productivity
you're looking for,

239
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,233
but also a better security.

240
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,829
So now let's focus and
work and talk about,

241
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,350
yes, we talked about this pillar

242
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,810
and this whole security
fabric as a platform,

243
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,359
what we wanna do for
Security-driven Networking.

244
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course, with the time
permits are not going to go into

245
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,390
all three pillar,

246
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,270
will focus on a
Security-driven Networking,

247
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,460
which is the core component
of today's discussion.

248
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,800
So the big thing about
Security-driven Networking is,

249
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,719
regardless of where
your users are working,

250
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,200
how do we provide the consistent security

251
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,810
and a consistent user experience.

252
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,439
So at Fortinet, the vision
that we have laid down

253
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,320
to provide this convergence
is very important,

254
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,550
we highlighted in this slide.

255
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,260
The first and foremost is,

256
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,900
we need to provide the performance
without any bottleneck.

257
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,490
Performance should not come in the picture

258
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,100
so that you don't have to enable
any security functionality.

259
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,960
And having a purpose built processor,

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,580
so that we can do a deep inspection,

261
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,220
deep security inspection is very critical.

262
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,910
Then this platform needs to
have an organic innovation

263
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,350
to develop things like SD-WAN, SD-branch,

264
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,070
often time you will see that these binders

265
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,140
are acquiring companies
and stitching them together

266
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,449
which some time may not scale.

267
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,930
It's important for you
to see the innovation,

268
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,689
the organic innovations,

269
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,240
which is keep with this kind of

270
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,053
purpose built security processor.

271
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,150
And then our vision is to make sure

272
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,760
when you are using this technology,

273
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,210
we are able to provide an
artificial intelligence

274
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,780
for network operations where
we can do an event correlation,

275
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,709
predictive analytics,

276
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,170
provide the digital experience monitoring,

277
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,110
so that you can measure
the user experience.

278
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,130
And all of this with
that certified security

279
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,223
we talked about.

280
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,730
So now when you apply

281
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,430
those principles of
Security-driven Networking,

282
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,849
again, to that shift of
edges that we talked about,

283
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,780
this is how your
architecture will look like.

284
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,143
You still have focus on users
and endpoint and devices,

285
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,640
but between users to your those
edges, you have a language,

286
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,093
which is again, secure
language, or SD-branch,

287
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,870
where your users are
within a branch of one

288
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,210
to working from home to a campus,

289
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,680
you're using technologies like SD-WAN,

290
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Zero Trust Network Access
and then you're going through

291
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,439
this one consistent unified policy

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,997
to access SaaS application,
cloud application,

293
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:15,573
and a broad application
in the data center.

294
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,920
But as you're doing it, you
still have that same security

295
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
that you're using at Campus and Branch,

296
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,103
also available in a
cloud delivered fashion.

297
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,150
So it's very important for
you to build a strategy where,

298
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,030
yes, you want security everywhere,

299
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,760
but it can't be just cloud or just edge,

300
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,540
you need to have a consistent
security on the edge,

301
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,870
on the WAN side, on the LAN
side for a segmentation,

302
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,463
as well as on the cloud side.

303
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,420
And there are very few
ways you can do this

304
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,270
unless you provide a consistent security

305
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,140
with this enterprise grade,

306
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,693
a trusted certification
that I talked about.

307
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,360
Let's talk about also that shift

308
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,290
to the cloud delivered security.

309
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,079
I mentioned that security
needs to be everywhere,

310
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,849
we are all well aware of an
edge security segmentation,

311
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,069
but one of the another important trend

312
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,569
that we are seeing is,

313
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,762
this term called Secure
Access Services Edge or SASE.

314
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,629
You might have seen this
Gartner coined this term

315
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,750
back in 2019.

316
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,240
To again, put the focus back on users

317
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,510
and make it easier for you
to do a security inspection,

318
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,270
move from your CapEx to OpEx

319
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,070
and then go to the SaaS
application for a simple access.

320
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:41,810
Platform that we've developed

321
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,080
this most comprehensive Secure
Access Services Edge platform

322
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,960
where all security and networking
is available as a service

323
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,483
delivered from cloud.

324
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,560
So now, your users who
continue to work remotely,

325
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,399
can directly go out to the internet access

326
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,370
but we will provide a
full security inspection

327
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,739
using next generation
firewall, secure web gateway,

328
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,800
to make sure we are
able to stop the threats

329
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,763
before they access SaaS application.

330
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,750
We give other flexibility
like yes, on the edges,

331
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,810
you want to reduce the point product.

332
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,330
You just wanted a 5G
connectivity with SD-WAN

333
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,010
and then go and connect to
those security the service.

334
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,393
Absolutely you can do that.

335
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,469
And the third thing that we talked about

336
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,960
you wanted an SD-WAN to connect outbound,

337
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,320
SD-WAN is a modern
technology which provides you

338
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,649
that application steering,
security is done at the cloud,

339
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,180
but you also need to
protect your segmentation,

340
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,594
your LAN-side, but we can
also enable that same security

341
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:53,913
on the edge.

342
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,870
So as you can see, the three
key things you can take away is

343
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,040
you'll get your digital
experience monitoring,

344
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,157
with that, digital
experiencing with the AIOps

345
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:08,379
and all those technologies
to consistently measure

346
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,330
the user experience, the
security we talked about,

347
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,409
and most flexible access to make sure

348
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,320
no matter where your users are,

349
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,929
they are getting always
on threat protection.

350
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,080
This is really as you can
see, bringing networking

351
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,399
and security together but
giving you a flexibility of how

352
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,620
you're consuming security
and how you're connecting

353
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,882
to those secure cloud.

354
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,290
So we talked about
Security-driven Networking,

355
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,840
we talked about the whole SASE concept.

356
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
One of the core element of SASE

357
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,213
is also Zero Trust Network Access.

358
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,600
I told you that it's about
how we're making sure

359
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,713
that users are the focal point.

360
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:59,230
The users are everywhere.

361
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,280
In the past what has happened is,

362
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,040
once users are connected via
VPN to your or your office,

363
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,430
they have always full
access and implicit access

364
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,240
to all application, all workload.

365
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,020
This needs to change.

366
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,730
This is where the Zero
Trust Network Access

367
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,680
allow your users to
provide an explicit trust

368
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,960
for a particular application
or a particular session.

369
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,010
And that's exactly what I'm showing here.

370
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,129
We have an access proxy
available on edge, in cloud,

371
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,850
everywhere you wanted
to make sure this users

372
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,783
before the access application,
you have a policy in place.

373
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,490
And it has an authentication

374
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,260
that has all kinds of control in place

375
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,600
to provide that further security

376
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,100
and the user and device level.

377
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,230
But now with that, you
can now simply say that

378
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,230
a user working suddenly
from Singapore is in HR,

379
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,640
but trying to access
a finance application,

380
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,763
they cannot do that.

381
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,600
He needs to have an
application access to his role,

382
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,340
and that mandate is done
as part of an access proxy.

383
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,530
We also take a look at the location

384
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,389
to make sure is that the right user.

385
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,850
And all of this together

386
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,370
provide that Zero Trust
Network Access for your users

387
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,620
to the right application.

388
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,180
So we talked about SASE,

389
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,740
we talk about the SASE as
an architectural vision,

390
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
let's talk about use
cases that you can apply

391
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,223
to your network right away.

392
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,560
So the first use case is really about

393
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,072
the off network remote users,

394
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:45,963
like what all of us
are experiencing today.

395
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,510
The second is slowly as your
users are going back to work,

396
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,700
how can you think about
a shift to architecture

397
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,220
and provide a thin network edge

398
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,970
where you don't have to
manage a lot of point product

399
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,370
and securities in the cloud.

400
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,190
And third, is that Zero Trust,

401
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,610
you can expand from working from home

402
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,483
all the way to all your users.

403
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,112
Let's focus on off-network.

404
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:16,350
This on the right side, you
can see your off-network users

405
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,500
with different devices getting connected

406
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,670
to SaaS and a cloud application.

407
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,800
Once you implement SASE each
of these off-network users

408
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,200
regardless of what device,

409
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
what operating system they're using,

410
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,640
with that agent they are connected

411
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,080
to an always on threat protection

412
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,770
to the SASE security as a
service and (indistinct) service.

413
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,909
So that means as users can
travel or they go anywhere,

414
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,950
security is going with them.

415
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,930
When they are accessing the
business critical application,

416
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,120
we are making sure we are
inspecting their application

417
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,120
and traffic using IPS,
application control, sandbox,

418
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,372
as an inspection like even DLP
to provide a full protection.

419
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,810
And that's where there's
consistent security

420
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,149
for your remote workers and
getting the best user experience

421
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,603
is a win win situation for
networking and security too.

422
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,679
The second is protecting in network edge.

423
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,410
We talked about, some of
you are already thinking

424
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,590
that as you're shifting back
as your users are coming back,

425
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,459
do you need that full
number of point products,

426
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,910
many of you have
firewalls, SD-WAN, Router,

427
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,943
maybe and some other products as well.

428
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,600
Making a thin network edge where

429
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,550
you are deliberately making sure that

430
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,040
you're using this point product,

431
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,100
you have products like
this modern technology,

432
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,100
SD-WAN, 5G, but then you
are making that connectivity

433
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,690
to SASE, to security the survey,

434
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,100
so that security you can offload

435
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,550
to a cloud delivered fashion.

436
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,170
And this gives you two key benefit.

437
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,453
You're shifting your CapEx and OpEx,

438
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,659
you have not to worry
about security patches

439
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,740
and other things.

440
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,190
You're always getting the
best of breed security,

441
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,480
and it's much easier for you
to manage this unified policy

442
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,013
across the edges to the remote users.

443
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,233
This is where again,

444
00:24:23,233 --> 00:24:25,763
you get that always on threat protection.

445
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,410
So now as we summarize all
of this great discussion,

446
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,800
we wanna go back to SASE,

447
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,770
requirements are great for
the work from anywhere,

448
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,453
but it needs to have three key principles.

449
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,540
SASE needs to provide

450
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,870
a really enterprise-grade
certified security.

451
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,010
Security can't be compromised.

452
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,860
You need to have a really
good thread intelligence,

453
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,510
a consistent security so that as you shift

454
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,910
from an enterprise edges
slowly to all cloud,

455
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,003
you have the consistent
security available everywhere.

456
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,250
Second, it needs to be part
of the bigger platform.

457
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,600
We talked about security fabric platform,

458
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,760
it can't be just looking
at from one point product,

459
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,870
it has to see from your
endpoint to the users

460
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,389
to the endpoint edges,

461
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,113
and all the cloud application.

462
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,250
And it needs to be highly scalable,

463
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,690
have those elasticity as we talked about,

464
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,563
to provide that user experience.

465
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,270
And third, for that successful
working from anywhere

466
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,270
for hybrid workforce,

467
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,840
it needs to provide an
excellent user experience.

468
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,889
So productivity does not become an issue.

469
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,970
And for that, you need to
have technologies like SD-WAN

470
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,810
organically developed and working

471
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,123
to provide the security first approach.

472
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,340
Yes, we talked about the platform and SASE

473
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,110
but one of the core
component of platform is,

474
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,243
to also have an open ecosystem.

475
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,959
We realize that many of you
have invested in many vendors.

476
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,000
And the platform needs
to have an open ecosystem

477
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,790
so that we provide deeper integration.

478
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,909
And this is an example
of Fortinet's platform

479
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,710
with 400 plus integrations
that we provide today

480
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,350
in a security fabric platform.

481
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,419
Other fabric connectors

482
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,190
which has deeper integration to the cloud,

483
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,000
and many other ServiceNow specific tools.

484
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,700
You see the fabric API's

485
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,260
where we provide another
level of integration.

486
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,920
There's a DevOps specific integration,

487
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,400
and an extended ecosystem, so
that your existing investment,

488
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,890
is well integrated with the
platform to make it easier

489
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,023
and provide that consistent policy.

490
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,423
So now that we learned
all of this great thing,

491
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,270
let's summarize that if
you need to apply, SASE,

492
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,870
you need to apply this
shift to the architecture,

493
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,592
what can you do immediately?

494
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,460
I recommend that next week,

495
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,540
you should now think about
a cross functional team,

496
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,000
having a security and networking workflows

497
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,903
and a branch transformation together.

498
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,930
So to remove the silos
that sometimes we hear,

499
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,940
and you have one cohesive team,

500
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,423
thinking about the SASE
based architecture.

501
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,970
In the first three months, you
can develop a SASE strategy,

502
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,930
again, SASE is a framework
is an architecture,

503
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,123
it will take time,

504
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,020
but as you can develop
an adoption timeline

505
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,710
and a measurable goals,
it will be easier for you

506
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,190
to go towards that finish

507
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,860
and that consistent Security Summit Edge,

508
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,351
some of the cloud delivered
for that good security posture

509
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:48,573
that we talked about.

510
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,413
You should evaluate the legacy VPN

511
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:55,170
into the Zero Trust Network Access,

512
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,590
so that you can go from an implicit

513
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,812
to an explicit trust per
application for all your users.

514
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,709
And as you go 12 months plus,

515
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,000
you definitely want to think about SD-WAN

516
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,780
and this cloud delivered
security from one vendor,

517
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,850
there are very few but handful
of vendors like Fortinet

518
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,429
who has a vision to provide that,

519
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,810
or you can have a two vendors

520
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,790
to have an SD-WAN and security.

521
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,030
But it gives you a consolidation,

522
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,180
a simple way to manage your networking

523
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,563
and security everywhere.

524
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,270
But while you do that,

525
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,270
you need to think about

526
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,180
how do you measure your
end to end experience

527
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,663
from edge to cloud.

528
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,320
So hopefully, this gives you
an idea of how you can apply

529
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,092
pure architecture, what
we talked about today.

530
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,423
Of course, to learn
more about us Fortinet,

531
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,860
we are a leading cybersecurity company,

532
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,523
we talked about the security
fabric as a platform,

533
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,750
big, big innovations is the DNA

534
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,633
to provide those new
technologies we talked about.

535
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,400
And of course, it's all
about to partner with you

536
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,210
now and in future for those innovations

537
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,600
to provide the best working
from anywhere experience

538
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,842
while providing great security protection.

539
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,530
So I hope this was helpful.

540
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,129
Thank you so much for your time.

541
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,173
Bye bye.
