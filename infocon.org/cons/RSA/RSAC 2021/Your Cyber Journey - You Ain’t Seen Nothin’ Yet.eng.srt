1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,969
- Hi, thank you for joining us today.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,700
We're here for the session
on Your Cyber Journey:

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,680
You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,690
This is a session that
originated back in 2013

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,546
and we've been able to bring back all

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,110
but one of our panelists,

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,750
Pamela Warren was not able
to join us and we miss her.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,170
But we do have four of the five people

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,010
that were there for the
original panel back in 2013.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,230
So today we have myself, I'm Lisa Lee,

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,090
I'm the Chief Security Advisor
and the Security Compliance

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,550
and Identity Business Development Lead

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,290
for Vertical Industries at Microsoft.

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,210
We also have Patty Titus,

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,930
who is the Chief
Information Security Officer

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,183
and Chief Privacy Officer at Markel.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
We have Aimee Larson-Kirkpatrick

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,459
who's the Global Communications Officer

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,750
at the Global Cyber Alliance.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,500
And we have Michelle Dennedy,
who is co-Founder and Partner

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,360
at Prevatus consulting and
also a stealth operation.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,160
And hopefully I said
that correctly Michelle.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,339
- It's close enough, it's perfect.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,173
- Close enough.

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,080
So we're really excited to
bring kind of a a redo back

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,750
or journey back to 2013

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,420
to look at where we were
then, where we are now,

28
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,660
what our journeys have been like,

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,310
and to talk a little bit about some things

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,470
that may help in your journey

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,760
as you go along your career path.

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,600
And so one of the things that we thought

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,550
might be a great place to start

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,300
would be to talk about
what was actually going on

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,250
in the industry and in
the world at the time.

36
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,470
And Michelle, I think you might
have some good pointers on

37
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,650
what was the context setting for 2013?

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,510
- Yeah, so 2013, just think about how busy

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,510
we all thought we were and
how innocent at the same time.

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,190
This is pre-Edward Snowden,

41
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,160
collapse of the security industry,

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,780
this is before GDPR was actually published

43
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,290
with its finding authorities before, LGPD,

44
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,010
before California had its
crazy scheisse going on.

45
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,050
Lots of stuff seemed really hard then,

46
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,039
and we had yet to experience 2020.

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,739
So we thought we were working
hard then and boy oh boy,

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,560
it was good that we learned
as much as we did them

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,740
because we needed it to
pack in our backpacks.

50
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,830
- And Patty, what do
you remember about 2013?

51
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,943
You know, cyber innovation was really

52
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,220
just starting to pick up.

53
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,910
We have got a very crowded market space

54
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,287
and now today, you know,

55
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:34,220
well back then was we
were just starting to see

56
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,109
that hacker for hire or hacker for rent,

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,400
getting into the dark web,

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,890
and I think almost anybody could do it,

59
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,950
but it was just really starting
to come into the foray.

60
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,643
So that's what I remember about 2013.

61
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,833
- Aimee, anything you'd
like to add to that

62
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,720
in terms of what was going on back then?

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,600
- Oh gosh, I think that
Lisa and I'm sorry,

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,870
Patty and Michelle pretty well covered it.

65
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,490
- Very good, what about how,
where we were all working

66
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,570
at the time, Aimee maybe
you can start there,

67
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,200
where were you back in 2013?

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,448
- Sure, thanks Lisa.

69
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,449
So when we were doing this
session at RSA in 2013,

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,830
I was actually with the
National Cyber Alliance,

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,040
and I was getting ready to
leave that organization.

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,730
It was my last day with that organization,

73
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,510
I've been there for five years.

74
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,820
It was my first five
years in cyber security.

75
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,820
And I had just moved from
Washington DC to California,

76
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,970
my husband was in the service,

77
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,730
and I was trying to
figure out what was next.

78
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,730
So I moved from being
employed full time to,

79
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,270
I was doing a little bit of consulting

80
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,393
and starting to explore new opportunities.

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,670
- Wow, how about you, Patty?

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,640
Where were you at that point?

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,250
- I was the CSO at the world's
largest security company

84
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
called Symantec.

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,070
- And Michelle, what were
you doing at the time?

86
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,480
- So I had just, I think fairly recently,

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,480
joined the rival security
company of McAfee Intel.

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,339
So yeah, I was a Vice President

89
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,402
and Chief Privacy Officer there.

90
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,160
- And I was working in the government.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,640
I was a bank examiner doing

92
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,840
cybersecurity and technology reviews

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,729
for a banking agency back then.

94
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,810
So I was a regulator.

95
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,810
So we've all had a long journey,
a curvy road, if you will,

96
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,230
ever since, lots of
things that have changed

97
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,760
both in our personal lives,

98
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,980
as well as in our professional lives

99
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,200
we're going to start in
kind of an odd place.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,450
We're going to start with

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,433
one of our two rapid fire sessions.

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,550
What was your worst experience

103
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,603
that you remember along the way?

104
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,790
Let me start with, we'll go
with Michelle on this one.

105
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,760
- Oh, 'cause she knows
I have tales to tell.

106
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,320
I think there's two sides of it.

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,260
One was very disconcerting personally

108
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,830
where a very drunken
sales person licked me

109
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,700
during an executive meeting,
and yes, you heard that right,

110
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,340
he licked me y'all and he said,

111
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,640
I wanted to see if you
tasted as good as you looked.

112
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,380
And it wasn't even that,
which was disgusting,

113
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,601
it was the fallout after
that was really unsettling.

114
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,400
So that sort of thing, number one on like,

115
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,510
wow, discrimination is
real and thing number two

116
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,200
was showing up at a job
where I was promised

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,659
the moon and the stars,

118
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,250
and it turned out somebody
else had been given

119
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,650
most of the budget, most of
the role, most of the team.

120
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,030
And I was there to be
some sort of like privacy

121
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,222
pin-up Barbie girl.

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,503
- How about Patty?

123
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,270
What was your worst experience?

124
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,060
- When I got to a job and
realized that I immediately

125
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,340
needed to start figuring out how to exit.

126
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,299
It happens, it happens,

127
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,950
and you know, it wasn't
what I planned for,

128
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,200
it wasn't what I thought.

129
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,853
And so there you are.

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,953
- You know, I think my
worst experience, two quick,

131
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:22,140
was one was someone asking me

132
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,466
what I was seeing in the industry
about a couple of minutes

133
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,780
before we went on to do a panel

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,549
and then they stole every
point that I gave them

135
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,780
and used my points bullet by bullet

136
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,270
when we got on stage and made fun of me

137
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,960
for not responding to the
question when I asked.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,500
So that plus the fact
that there was a time

139
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,457
when I was kind of getting
shoved into the box

140
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:45,256
and my wings were getting clipped,

141
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,869
make sure that I was
going back into the box

142
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,070
and then they wanted to nail the lid on.

143
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,440
So that was mine.

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,110
Aimee, what was your worst experience?

145
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,490
- Yeah, a couple.

146
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,210
So I was doing some
advocacy work for awhile,

147
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,140
trying to pass some legislation

148
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,140
and I got aggressively
attacked by the opposition

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,609
in a really scary, scary
way, like threats were made.

150
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,300
And if you dig deep
enough on the internet,

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,380
you can find some of it.

152
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,590
There were really terrible,
awful things posted,

153
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,020
that just make me ill to this day.

154
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,090
And then when I entered
into cybersecurity,

155
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,520
actually one of the
very first things I did

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,039
was come to the RSA Conference.

157
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
I didn't really know anything about it.

158
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,540
And I really experienced some

159
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,950
terrible sexism and
aggressive behavior by men

160
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,783
in the industry.

161
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:39,310
I got followed up the street one night

162
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,900
by some conference goers.

163
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,900
And so yeah, there was
some bad behavior there.

164
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,510
Yeah.
- At that moment.

165
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,380
So we're going to continue in that kind of

166
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,279
not so positive moment
for just a little bit,

167
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,280
but shifting gears, Patty,

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,006
you've had some really challenging roles

169
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:05,929
and some big opportunities,
but I wondered,

170
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,828
could you share a little
bit about what can happen

171
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,820
to our dream job?

172
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,250
What can happen when the dream job

173
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,713
maybe isn't so dreamy?

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,700
- Yeah, so you get to this new job

175
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,740
and you think it's one thing

176
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,480
and the company has sold you on that

177
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,890
and you're convinced it's
going to be everything

178
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,550
and then something,

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,210
and you find out that you've
been sold a bill of goods,

180
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,043
basically.

181
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,210
So it's similar to what
Michelle experienced

182
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,219
or even better,

183
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,929
they tell you that
they've had a data breach

184
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,859
right before you got there.

185
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,450
It's much more difficult to slide

186
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,790
that one under the covers now

187
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,579
with more data breach reporting.

188
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,100
But nevertheless, it
did happen in the past

189
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,980
and you've got a big pile of badness

190
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,250
that you have to figure out immediately,

191
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,730
or you're replacing somebody
that started down the path

192
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,930
and then got exited.

193
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,930
So, it is unfortunate, but dream jobs,

194
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,540
I don't know where you
set your expectations

195
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,030
but your dream job doesn't
always end up quite

196
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,530
where you thought it would be.

197
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,573
So that's kind of my experience
on a dream job going wrong.

198
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,400
- And Michelle, what about you?

199
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,470
- Yeah, I think it's a similar thing.

200
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,470
And I think as you're
working through your career,

201
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,960
realize that what you
dreamed might not be exactly

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,500
what you thought it was going to be.

203
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,790
It could be that you love
getting your hands dirty

204
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,719
and being in the thick
of incident response,

205
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,859
it could be that you really
like people leadership,

206
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,810
and it could be that once
you get to the VP level,

207
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,400
you realize it's like
being in kindergarten again

208
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,780
it's about power and who gets face time

209
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,470
and stuff that doesn't feel as meaningful.

210
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,510
So I think going in with an expectation

211
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,480
that you're going to
go in to learn things,

212
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,050
it's not going to be what you expected.

213
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,459
And even if everything
is perfect internally

214
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,300
with your company, into everyone's life,

215
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,252
a little ransomware shall fall.

216
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,730
- So Aimee, have you had any experiences

217
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,630
around the the dream job, either the myth

218
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,170
or maybe something went wrong?

219
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,280
- Yeah, well, I do
think that the dream job

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,113
is a bit of a myth.

221
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,360
When you think about dreams
and not all dreams are great.

222
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,300
They don't always go
the way that you think

223
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,132
they're going to go.

224
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:42,940
But, you know, I went into a job one time,

225
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,435
really excited about it,

226
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:48,243
and as soon as I got in,

227
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:53,244
realized that there were a
number of shady things going on,

228
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,100
possibly illegal requests being made,

229
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,480
and was not quite sure what
I had gotten myself into.

230
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,610
I had to start making some
phone calls to board members

231
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,843
and was not such a great situation.

232
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,660
- And so for anyone,

233
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,760
do you think there are times when

234
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,470
you may have to take action

235
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,053
based on how that dream job
worked out or didn't work out?

236
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,150
- Oh, absolutely.

237
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,250
You have to be your own advocate

238
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,310
because you're going to be
your number one cheerleader,

239
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,589
promoter, advocate,

240
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,670
nobody else is really
going to do it for you.

241
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,083
So yes, you should absolutely take action.

242
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,230
- And Michelle, I'm curious
because you shared something

243
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,710
with us as we were prepping for this,

244
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,710
about how sometimes that
environment can trail with you.

245
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:44,796
Can you talk about that just a little bit

246
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,060
in terms of the dream job?

247
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,935
- Yeah, it's like, what is it?

248
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:51,740
Buckaroo, Banzai Buckaroo,
or Buckaroo Banzai,

249
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,410
like wherever you go, there you are.

250
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,680
I have found that if you
haven't resolved yourself,

251
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,113
and you haven't figured out
what you're drawing it to,

252
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,305
I went from one toxic
man to another toxic man.

253
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:11,305
I replayed the same toxic behavior

254
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,610
and actually went to the new job

255
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,160
and found exactly the same
sort of toxic environment

256
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,043
that I left because I
hadn't really resolved,

257
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,920
it's kind of like in your
personal relationships

258
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,469
where you're going to
relive that relationship

259
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,210
until you figure out how do
you want to be in that moment?

260
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,210
How do you want to stand up for yourself?

261
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,960
What are you willing to do to accommodate

262
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,624
a toxic personality?

263
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:35,917
And I think sometimes we
really have to stop and reflect

264
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,700
and figure out how do we avoid

265
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,360
redoing the same toxic scenario?

266
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
Sometimes it's not you,
and sometimes it's you

267
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
looking for the same externalities

268
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,793
that are very, very dangerous.

269
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,930
- So Patty, I'm curious,

270
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,180
kind of a follow-up to
your earlier points.

271
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,483
Do you think there's just
one dream job for each of us?

272
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,790
- No, I don't, I don't
think there's one dream job.

273
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,762
I think over a period of time
in your professional life,

274
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,670
your idea of what your
dream job is going to be

275
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,510
is going to change.

276
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,590
And I like what Aimee said,

277
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,800
but dreams sometimes turn
into nightmares, right?

278
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,800
And so you can be in your dream
job and some of it is about

279
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,989
how you fit organizationally
or who you report to,

280
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,480
how your personalities jive,
how's the team dynamic,

281
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,979
are you getting influence
and support at the top?

282
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:41,440
So I think you can look
for a silver lining

283
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,290
in just about anything.

284
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,073
And that I think is probably the key.

285
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,760
And I've been in a job that
didn't start out as my dream job

286
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,569
and it turned into my dream job.

287
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,570
So I think some of it is where
you set your expectations.

288
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,410
And I think that sometimes that gets us

289
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,260
into a little bit of trouble as well.

290
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,392
- Yeah, it does.

291
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,420
So, we're going to start moving more

292
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,280
toward the positive now, which is great,

293
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,020
we're kind of going down
the path, in terms of your,

294
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,780
think of your biggest
career success or maybe,

295
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,100
some of those tough,
challenging career decisions,

296
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,810
what were the things that
either helped you get

297
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,650
to that success point or maybe
the things that helped you

298
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,579
get through those tough decisions?

299
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,750
In other words, you know, what helped?

300
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,683
Aimee, what's something
that has stood out for you?

301
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,173
- Oh, that has helped?

302
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,233
You know, I think it is,

303
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,750
I do a lot of self-reflection

304
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,980
and I think one of the things
is always asking myself,

305
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,950
what am I doing that doesn't add value

306
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,520
and doesn't get me to where I want to be?

307
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,370
Whether it's the things
that you do at work

308
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,350
that are of little to no value

309
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,150
because maybe you're avoiding like

310
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,150
the big, hairy, scary task
that is going to be impactful.

311
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,977
And even the things in your
personal life that take up time,

312
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:19,977
that don't bring you joy, that
don't add value to your life,

313
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,370
like scrolling through social media

314
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,580
in the middle of the night,

315
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,580
or getting sucked into
watching too much television

316
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:32,860
that aren't helping move you forward.

317
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,360
I think that asking
yourself that question,

318
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,800
what am I willing to let go of?

319
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,800
What am I willing to stop
so that I can move forward?

320
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,990
- Michelle, what stands out
for you in terms of things that

321
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,710
helped you get to those success points

322
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,100
or maybe helped you through
those big challenging decisions?

323
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,100
- Yeah, I think some successes
sort of sneak up on you

324
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,189
and I used to call home,

325
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,740
I promised my mother
when I left home at 18,

326
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,490
that I would call home
every day, every Saturday.

327
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,150
And in those conversations,

328
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,016
both my parents were patent litigators

329
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:15,183
and my dad was a security architect.

330
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,260
We basically, every Saturday morning

331
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,750
started writing the "Privacy
Engineers Manifesto" together

332
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,950
by accident.

333
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,704
I was bringing my worries and
my troubles as a litigator,

334
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,890
and then later as a
privacy officer to my dad

335
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,819
who was very technical and
my mom who's an IP lawyer.

336
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
And slowly over time,

337
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,570
we started building what turned into

338
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,300
the "Privacy Engineers Manifesto."

339
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,260
And it was one of the best
experiences of my life

340
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,730
to do a book signing with my
father and my business partner,

341
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,494
Jonathan Fox to really try
to teach the next generation

342
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:52,980
how to take privacy requirements
and policy requirements

343
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,820
and really metabolize them
into the infrastructure.

344
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,370
So I think sometimes you think

345
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,750
that you're doing something personal,

346
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,310
you think that you're doing something

347
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,280
that's just sort of inward looking,

348
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,410
and what you're really doing

349
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,990
is you're building that foundation

350
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,913
where you have the opportunity
to really give back.

351
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,780
- So Patty, I know you've
had lots of situations

352
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
that there've been some tough decisions,

353
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,730
there have been some
really great opportunities,

354
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,140
but still decisions that
went along with them.

355
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,750
Is there anything that stands out for you

356
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,673
that really helped you in
those kinds of moments?

357
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,530
- Yeah, what was important
to me at one point

358
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,913
is setting the boundaries,
setting my goals and objectives.

359
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,260
So what are you looking
for in the next job?

360
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,340
Are you looking for competitive salary?

361
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,763
Are you looking for,

362
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,123
will the company offer you
an influencing position?

363
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,600
What are the things really that you want

364
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,649
in order for you to be
satisfied to leave one job

365
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,210
and go to another or one position?

366
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,180
And I think we don't necessarily
set those boundaries up,

367
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,481
we just think, oh, they're offering me

368
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:07,320
another $20,000 a year, that
sounds great, I'll take it.

369
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,040
I really wish that, each
one of my positions,

370
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,420
I wish somebody else would
have negotiated for it,

371
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,830
because you're never
sure what you're worth,

372
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,562
am I worth five bucks or 10?

373
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,669
But I will tell you if
you've set some boundaries

374
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,520
and some goals to say in this
next job, this is what I want,

375
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,040
don't settle, because in our
profession, in our field,

376
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,050
it's kind of like the weather.

377
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,419
If you wait five minutes,
it's going to change.

378
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,170
So something better will come along,

379
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,720
but hold tight to those objectives.

380
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,870
And the one thing that I've
been very cautious with,

381
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,879
especially as a female in this
male dominated career field.

382
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,880
is to never let my base salary drop,

383
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,030
That is just something
that's non-negotiable.

384
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,910
If the company says, we'll
give you this comp package,

385
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,273
but you've got to take a
lower bonus or a lower base.

386
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,320
For me, that's not going to happen.

387
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,500
I can negotiate bonus or
things that are influenced

388
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,100
in another way, but I've worked
too hard to get that base

389
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,827
to where I think, I think,

390
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,477
I'm a little bit competitive
to my male counterparts.

391
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,210
- So I'm going to take a
couple extra minutes here

392
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,840
just because we have some time,

393
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,379
and this is I think really a meaty topic,

394
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,920
and so I was wondering,
how much your network

395
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,680
or the people that support you

396
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,350
have factored into where you
are today in your career,

397
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,683
Aimee, that one's for you.

398
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,379
- Yeah, so I think it's hugely important.

399
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,470
And being here with this
particular group of women,

400
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,570
is incredibly important to me because

401
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,740
this is part of my personal
board of directors,

402
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,920
all three of these women.

403
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,920
And these are the people
who are real with me,

404
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,000
who tell me the truth
when I ask questions,

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,580
have provided me counseling
and guidance over the years,

406
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,870
have allowed me to
bounce things off of them

407
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,120
as I'm working through my own career.

408
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,879
So, I think it's hugely important.

409
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,500
And I think that networking
is hugely important.

410
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,070
You never know who is
going to help you next.

411
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,620
And to maintain those
relationships I think is critical,

412
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,453
it's vital.

413
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,240
- Yeah, I can say for myself
that I would not have the job

414
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
exactly that I have today,
except for a contact.

415
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,080
I had tried multiple
different ways to get in.

416
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,669
It was only through a contact

417
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,180
that I even had the opportunity.

418
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,850
So you never know when
something's gonna happen,

419
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,398
just because of that.

420
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,377
All right, let's talk about,

421
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,310
there's so many things to consider

422
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,280
as you're planning your career

423
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
or you're trying to move up the ladder

424
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,973
or maybe you're trying
to move out the door,

425
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,220
can you talk a little bit about

426
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,980
where are some areas where we,
and particularly we as women,

427
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,470
but all of us, so everyone included,

428
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,510
but where do we need to get real?

429
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,710
Where are some areas that maybe

430
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,560
we need to think a little bit harder,

431
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,250
be a little bit more clear with ourselves

432
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,470
more honest with ourselves,

433
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,490
but where do we need to get real,

434
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,170
Patty, I'll let you take that one first.

435
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,870
- Yeah, so one of the things
that I always think about

436
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,580
and it was actually really good advice

437
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,129
and I got it again from my current boss

438
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,560
just in my last performance evaluation,

439
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,310
as oddly as that seems,
it has come up yet again,

440
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,270
so it must be something,

441
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,270
a pearl of wisdom I needed to hear again.

442
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,660
And that is work one grade
up from where you are.

443
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,610
So if you are working
at that next level up,

444
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,969
so let's say you're a VP
and you want to be an SVP.

445
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,040
If you're already working
at that SVP level,

446
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,760
then when the promotions come along,

447
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,180
people are going to look at it and go,

448
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,280
oh, well that person's
already working at that level.

449
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,220
So that's an easy answer.

450
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,050
So that was some really good advice

451
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,520
that I just recently got
from my current supervisor.

452
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,690
- Wow, so that's not just a
dress for the job you want

453
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,750
but kind of work in the
job that you want. right?

454
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,900
- Exactly, exactly.

455
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,650
It's really hard, there's so many people

456
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,910
that just come to work
and they're like today,

457
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,450
my job is X and that's
all I'm going to do.

458
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,118
And even in this COVID world

459
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,330
where we've all been remote work,

460
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,179
we've probably, some of us anyway,

461
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,240
have put a lot of pressure
on ourselves to work more,

462
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
it doesn't necessarily mean

463
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,433
you're working at the next level.

464
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,010
- That's true, Michelle,
what would you add to that

465
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,590
in terms of areas where
we need to get real?

466
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,570
- Yeah, I think you have to really embrace

467
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,810
the opportunity for
yourself and your family.

468
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,610
I think it's really easy to
say here's a C level role,

469
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,899
here's a very high compensation role,

470
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,520
but suddenly that ticket punches out

471
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
and it says global services.

472
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,050
That's actually not a good moment.

473
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,440
When the ticket came out and
said united global services,

474
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,380
it meant that I had
spent way too much time

475
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,260
away from my family.

476
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,103
And you have to really understand
what are the trade-offs,

477
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,980
we're only getting older,
we're not getting any younger.

478
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,690
So you have to really understand,

479
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,267
how are you going to
keep your mind together,

480
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,770
and your body together?

481
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,189
How are you going to stay healthy

482
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:23,210
in all aspects of your life?

483
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,910
So there's that piece of it.

484
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,950
And then the other piece of it is

485
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,920
there comes a time

486
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,590
when you're known for
doing a certain thing.

487
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,939
And that's always been
my time to like zag,

488
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,000
everyone else is zigging, I gotta zag.

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,580
So, what's a girl to do in
the middle of the pandemic?

490
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,332
Oh, join as a CEO of a startup
company, of course, crazy.

491
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,290
But you learn so much in that way.

492
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,610
If you figure out that what
you're really hungry for

493
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,760
is learning and opportunity and changing

494
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,600
and constantly challenging yourself

495
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,909
and going into those places
where no one has been.

496
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,120
If that's what's important to you,

497
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,310
you may not want to be
on that step function of

498
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,663
next level, next level, next level.

499
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,570
- What about, Aimee, if I could,

500
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,580
I'm gonna ask you a direct question

501
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,600
then I'll let you kind
of fill anywhere you want

502
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,250
in terms of where we need to get real,

503
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,490
but we hear a lot about imposter syndrome,

504
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,760
is that something that you think women

505
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,040
are still challenged with?

506
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,790
And I've heard recently
that men are challenged with

507
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,440
imposter syndrome as well.

508
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,050
Any thoughts around that?

509
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,050
- Yeah, so I do think that
women are challenged within,

510
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,080
we're challenged with it at
different points in our career,

511
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,010
and our lives.

512
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,100
And know, figuring out how to move past it

513
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,100
is really important and know
that you're likely in the job

514
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,909
that you're in because somebody saw that

515
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,140
you had the capability to do it.

516
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,630
So have confidence and believe in yourself

517
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,850
and challenge yourself and
quit listening to the voice

518
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,975
that's nagging at you
saying you can't because,

519
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:02,642
I think the great saying is,

520
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,710
if you believe you can, you can,

521
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,702
if you believe you can't,
you probably can't.

522
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:13,173
So it goes either way,
believe in yourself.

523
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,033
- That's great.

524
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,930
So we're back to our
next rapid fire session.

525
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,610
And so here, I want you to,

526
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,530
instead, we talked about
our worst experience,

527
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,240
let's look at it from the other angle,

528
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,420
what's been your best experience?

529
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,053
So rapid fire, best
experience, back to you, Patty.

530
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,290
- Probably when I was the
CISO, the first federal CISO

531
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,020
at the Transportation
Security Administration,

532
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,680
standing up a brand new
federal organization

533
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,624
just after the tragedy of 9/11.

534
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,930
There was nothing like
mission, get it done,

535
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,757
it was by far the greatest experience.

536
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:56,870
And I still think about it and
wish that the good old days

537
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,219
would come back, but
maybe not for that reason.

538
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,340
- Michelle, how about you?

539
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,030
- I already said book signing with my dad,

540
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,410
so I'll all pick,

541
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,040
I was able to actually give
the graduation convocation

542
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,860
at Carnegie Mellon Graduate School

543
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,530
and see some of my students
in privacy engineering

544
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,720
actually walking with
caps and cast and gowns

545
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,980
and their families.

546
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,730
And then on the other
level teaching a young lady

547
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,100
down in South Central LA about
cyber safety and security,

548
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,810
she came up to us afterwards

549
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,649
and I was with Nev from
the MTV show "Catfish."

550
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,860
And she said, I have a secret.

551
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,929
And I said, what's your secret?

552
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,480
She's like, it's kind of scary.

553
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,639
I want to be an astronaut.

554
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,000
And my sort of delight in able
to being able to connect her

555
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,750
with some engineers at NASA

556
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,560
and making that seemingly
impossible dream come true

557
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
for someone in the next generation.

558
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,072
That is a rush that you cannot buy.

559
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,158
- Fantastic.

560
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,170
And I'll just interject
there really quickly,

561
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,790
we didn't mention, but
back in the early days

562
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,460
when we were doing the first panel

563
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,670
we were all working or
volunteering, I should say,

564
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,600
in schools and going in and teaching kids

565
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,969
about being safe online and you know,

566
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,690
so lots of good opportunity there

567
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,097
to give back to our community.

568
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,220
And I know everybody
here is still doing that

569
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,430
in various different ways.

570
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,140
Aimee, what was your
best career experience?

571
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,460
- Yes, so one the big highlights

572
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,630
of my career was I was actually,

573
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,820
Michelle Dennedy was with me,

574
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,090
I had worked for a year and a half

575
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,370
with some of the largest
companies on the world

576
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,489
to come up with a campaign
around cybersecurity

577
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,550
and it got launched at the White House.

578
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,080
And President Obama said the words,

579
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
stop, think, connect.

580
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,540
And that was just, that
was pretty spectacular.

581
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,500
And then getting to watch that grow

582
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,100
into an international campaign

583
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,850
that was adopted around
the world was pretty cool.

584
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,198
And watching Michelle's youngest daughter

585
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:09,030
sing the words a year later was,

586
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,730
yeah, that was pretty special.

587
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,590
- Well, yeah, no, I think
that having the president

588
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,775
use the words from the
campaign that you started

589
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:19,780
has to be really up
there, so that's exciting.

590
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,420
Mine doesn't come anywhere close to that.

591
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,260
But I think one of my favorite experiences

592
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,160
that's more recent, is
just thinking back to,

593
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,850
having just come out a
couple of months beforehand,

594
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,860
having come out of the so-called box,

595
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,020
the place where I was kind
of getting shoved in the box

596
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,230
and getting to be in an environment

597
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,620
where I'm just a couple
of months in a new role.

598
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,590
And I'm sitting next to
the CSO at our company

599
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,980
with one of our large customers

600
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,490
and the CSO had to go to
another meeting and he said,

601
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,850
but you know, you're in good hands,

602
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,510
I'm leaving you with Lisa,
you're in good hands.

603
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,470
And I thought, well, I'm
not even sure if I know

604
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,580
which end is up at this point, I'm so new.

605
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,669
But just that feeling of
having come from where

606
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,622
I was being shoved down to
where I was being lifted up,

607
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,260
that really meant something to me.

608
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,180
So that was a great experience for me.

609
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,280
It doesn't come close to Mr. Obama

610
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,410
talking about your program though.

611
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,393
So maybe words to aspire to there.

612
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,360
How about in terms of, how
did you improve your lot,

613
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,120
and how did you actually move up?

614
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,560
What were some of the
things that really factored

615
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,703
into that for you?

616
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,053
And Patty we'll go to you with that one.

617
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,870
- I think the mentoring
program in my mind,

618
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,209
it's how we improve and
either you're mentored

619
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,990
or you're a mentee.

620
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,773
I have to say, though,

621
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,140
I get probably more out of my mentoring

622
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,130
than probably people I mentor.

623
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,920
And so to me, it's a two way dialogue.

624
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,730
It's an opportunity to discuss challenges

625
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,370
and things that are happening.

626
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,668
But I think in my mind, it's mentoring,

627
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:03,042
it's that lifting people as you rise.

628
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:07,584
And that I think has been, thank you,

629
00:30:07,585 --> 00:30:10,450
Nula Kelly O'Connor for saying that at

630
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,250
an Executive Women's Forum Meeting,

631
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,650
and it has stuck in my
head all these years

632
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,120
that as I rise up in my position

633
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,062
I will bring others along with me.

634
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,350
- And Aimee, what's something there that

635
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,760
in terms of how you've
improved or moved up,

636
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
what's helped you with that?

637
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,750
- You know, I think a lot of it goes to

638
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,890
being really thoughtful
in educating myself

639
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,440
and being responsible for my own career,

640
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,440
advocating for myself, setting goals

641
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,159
and setting a path towards achieving them

642
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,020
and then surrounding, creating a network

643
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,889
that supports me like all of you,

644
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,673
I think has been a big
factor in my career.

645
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,810
- Michelle, anything you would add?

646
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,649
- Yeah, I think the only
thing I would add to that

647
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,380
is as you get more and more senior,

648
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,280
the the pyramid gets pointier and pointier

649
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,540
and sometimes it's stabbing you

650
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,170
and you can't be like the cool
kid that goes out for drinks

651
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,980
and lunch and it's quite lonely.

652
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,330
So you have to figure out,
nobody's saying, woe is me,

653
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,879
but you have to figure
out how do you continue

654
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,940
to keep your energy high, have
someone that you can trust

655
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,160
when you do feel weak and
understand that your words

656
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,100
start to have a very big impact

657
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,639
that you may not have realized.

658
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,940
As you're coming up through the ranks,

659
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,130
you can be a little more
flippant and a little more jokey,

660
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,550
a little more casual,

661
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,659
as you get more and more
senior your words have

662
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,020
very strong impact.

663
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,453
And so really titrating yourself.

664
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,480
I think we all feel like
we're still 25 inside,

665
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,810
but realizing, what is going on,

666
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,139
what are my puts and pulls
of command and control

667
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,710
and understanding how to wield
your power when you have it.

668
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,914
- Yeah, I think that's
a great point, Michelle,

669
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:10,470
I did kind of an informal
survey among people

670
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,630
that I knew many, many years ago

671
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,950
and all in senior positions
and every single person,

672
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,780
I think loneliness, was the biggest thing

673
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,370
that came out of it, they
couldn't put words to it,

674
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,419
but once you asked the questions,

675
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,860
you found out that really
was the driving factor.

676
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,203
So great point there.

677
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,080
So I want to make sure that we mention

678
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,699
that we're still taking questions

679
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,440
and I should have mentioned
that at the beginning

680
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,360
that we're taking questions
and we'll answer those

681
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,600
as we can.

682
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,370
We have resources on the
slides, if you want to download,

683
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,860
there's just a couple of slides

684
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,330
where each of us have
listed some resources

685
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,129
that we thought were helpful

686
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,620
or could provide some insight
to you, tools that we've used,

687
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,290
tips that we have, things like that.

688
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,700
So I would encourage you
to download the slides.

689
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,380
And then I want us to finish with,

690
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,593
we talked about you
ain't seen nothing yet.

691
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,860
What have you ladies not seen yet?

692
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,820
What's next?

693
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,733
What's coming or how would you
interpret that for yourself?

694
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,809
Patty, we'll go to you for that.

695
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:13,290
- I have no idea, absolutely none.

696
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,409
I don't know what's next.

697
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,213
Who would have thought that
we'd have all the ransomware

698
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,780
that we got last year and this year?

699
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,820
We never know what corner
we're going to take,

700
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,720
we never know what
opportunity is going to come,

701
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,150
but that's the coolest thing
about this whole career field,

702
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,320
this profession,

703
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,600
is you don't know where
the twists and turns are.

704
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,929
Always when I was growing up,
I wanted to have the eyeball

705
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,940
on the end of my finger because
I'm the youngest of five

706
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,460
and we don't need to go into that,

707
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,240
but then I could peek around the corner

708
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,780
and see who was going to jump me.

709
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,870
So we don't know what's around that corner

710
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,810
and I'm looking forward to what's next

711
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,690
and what's going to continue to happen.

712
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,790
It's an exciting field

713
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,699
- Michelle, how about you?

714
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,720
What's next?

715
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,020
- I like to be the jumper.

716
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,920
I think that the minute you
start getting comfortable,

717
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,970
it's time to get uncomfortable.

718
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,914
So, right now I'm fundraising

719
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:05,710
for a stealth software company.

720
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,719
I'm doing consultancy
work in a proximate field,

721
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,480
learning things about how to
be a better business person,

722
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,050
how to be a better ethicist,

723
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,610
how to be a better
leader in your community,

724
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,969
only adds to the excitement and the joy

725
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,382
and really the fulfillment
of this career path.

726
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,770
- And Aimee, what about you?

727
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,380
- Yeah, I'm with Patty,
I don't know what's next.

728
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,949
There's so much happening in cybersecurity

729
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,129
and privacy right now.

730
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,100
And I think we're going
to see some big changes.

731
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,380
I see changes happening around the world

732
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,860
in the communities that I work in.

733
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,159
So I'm not sure that I
can predict right now.

734
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,250
But it's an exciting
time to be in this field

735
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,400
and I'm happy to be here.

736
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,460
- Yeah, it is definitely an
exciting time to be here.

737
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,138
I think for me in terms of what's next,

738
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:57,150
it might be board positions.

739
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,750
I'd like to take my financial experience

740
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,350
as well as my cyber experience.

741
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,430
And maybe put that to good
use in some board positions.

742
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,790
I'd also like to write a book,
I know Michelle's done that,

743
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,200
I haven't yet, but I'd like
to write a leadership book.

744
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,189
So I think there's something there.

745
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,240
Of course, finding the
time is always the trick

746
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
and the difficulty there.

747
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,970
I want to thank you ladies
for joining us today,

748
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,759
it's so great to come back.

749
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,650
I do think that there's a lot
of path left for all of us,

750
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,770
some big, exciting things yet to come.

751
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,850
We know there's some
big challenges as well

752
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,089
because our industry is one that continues

753
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,150
to challenge for sure.

754
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,639
But thank you, again, we encourage you

755
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,030
to check out the resources and the slides.

756
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,030
And we look forward to answering

757
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,457
some more of your questions.
