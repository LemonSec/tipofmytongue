1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,010
- Welcome everybody,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,410
we have an excellent
presentation for you today,

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,963
on lessons learned from
taking justice remote

4
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:12,430
during COVID-19 pandemic.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,860
With me we have the New Jersey Courts CIO

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,710
Jack McCarthy and myself,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,220
we're gonna go through how the
court took justice remotely

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,630
from a largely physical court
to a remote virtual court.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,480
So the topics we have going on today,

10
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,920
are trends during the pandemic,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,460
background on the New
Jersey Courts system,

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,560
technologies used by New Jersey Courts,

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,930
how to run a remote court
with three days of notice,

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,650
and now we're in April,
so it's a year later,

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,879
remote network services,

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,410
summary and contact information.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,370
So with that, we're gonna
go straight to trends.

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,202
Okay.

19
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,390
So one of the things we
had seen back in April,

20
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,270
we were connected to Homeland security,

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,110
the New Jersey version
of Homeland security,

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,330
what we call MS-ISAC,

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,330
so they were sending
us a lot of information

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,399
about threat actors,

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,070
in terms of zoom bombing,
you know, zoom emails

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,800
that were fake in nature,

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,640
as you can see by some of these
emails that were going on,

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,840
and we had seen just an upward take

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,960
in COVID-19 related domains, Coronavirus,

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,323
so we got a lot of communication,

31
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:26,500
concerning some key issues that
were going on at that time,

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,290
clearly the hackers were using
COVID-19 to remain active,

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,970
and to get even more active

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,710
in terms of hacking at that moment.

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,339
I saw one report, a threat
intelligence report,

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,300
which actually was showing,

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,460
how if you were in Alabama,

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,660
you were getting Alabama
specific Coronavirus

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,520
versus New York or versus,
you know, South Carolina,

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,759
so there were differences there.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,353
Since and obviously the pandemic continued

42
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:55,259
and in the last several months,

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,040
well, obviously we all have seen this,

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,490
we heard the shocking
news of SolarWinds being,

45
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,630
you know, compromised, right?

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,350
And the supply chain of
SolarWinds being compromised,

47
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,880
on the right side there,

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,740
you can see the customers,
the Solar Winds has,

49
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,920
clearly the federal government,

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,109
major corporations like EMC
Ericsson, so on and so forth,

51
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,880
universities, you name it,
you know, SolarWinds had it,

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,930
so, that has been a shock
to the system entirely,

53
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,073
and so we had continued through that,

54
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,799
with some additional
information on the background

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,216
of New Jersey Courts,

56
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,140
Jack McCarthy is going
to go right into that.

57
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,089
- Thanks Sajed

58
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,690
A little brief history about me,

59
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,820
I've been the CIO for
the New Jersey Courts

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,160
for the last almost nine years,

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,320
although I think anybody

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,760
that's lived in IT for the last year,

63
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,269
gets about an extra five
years of experience from it.

64
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,140
I had Sajed job,

65
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,989
back in about 13 years ago
when life was a lot easier,

66
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,991
we didn't have things like SolarWinds

67
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:00,831
and zero trust flying around at us.

68
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,790
The Judiciary itself,

69
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,359
New Jersey is a little bit unique

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,720
in that we're a statewide Judiciary,

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
what that means is back in 1995

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,709
we had a constitutional change,

73
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,220
that put all of the
courts under one entity,

74
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,100
and in our case our central office,

75
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,450
the administrative office of the courts,

76
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,436
and so we're a little bit lucky in that

77
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:25,940
I have everything from parking tickets,

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,000
up to Supreme court opinions in cases,

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,170
and they all fall into one data center,

80
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,540
one giant network spread
across the entire state.

81
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,420
New Jersey serves 7 million residents,

82
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,250
we have around 13,000 staff
between the municipal courts

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,730
and at the state level,

84
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,730
we support roughly 100,000
attorneys in New Jersey,

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,750
and another 40,000 police officers,

86
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,440
our network is spread
where every municipality

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,880
has their own municipal court,

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,240
as well as the county level
courts and the state level,

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,460
we have around 700 sites
spread throughout the state.

90
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,330
Back in February of 2020,

91
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,200
we were largely 100% in person,

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,623
so we did have some staff

93
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,050
that would work at home occasionally,

94
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,209
but generally we were an in person shop,

95
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,930
very few mobile devices as
you see up on the slide,

96
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,240
we had around 2,500 iPads and laptops,

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,707
you know, for our 13,000 staff,

98
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:34,360
but we were generally, you
know setting up the desk,

99
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,460
you know, big giant boxes under the desks

100
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,272
with dual monitors, et cetera.

101
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,910
What we had to do, was focus

102
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,910
on moving all of that
offsite and very rapidly,

103
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,370
I came up with a quote back then,

104
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,520
we did six months of
work in about six days,

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,830
but it really wasn't that,

106
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,070
it was the six years of planning
that created all of that,

107
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,710
and that's what we're gonna walk through

108
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,719
in the next few slides,

109
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,190
and talk about,

110
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,410
the planning that took place
to get us to where we do,

111
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,033
but also how we did it and
how we did it securely.

112
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:11,030
Just a little bit more
about our technology,

113
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,919
primarily a mainframe
shop with our datacenter,

114
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,900
our network has grown over the years,

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,560
from the 1970s and 80's,

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,050
we were generally, you know,
designed as a spoken wheel,

117
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,500
where everything out in the field

118
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,450
headed to one egress point of
the datacenter and Trenton,

119
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,090
and as we, you know,
created lands and lands,

120
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,859
and moved on to our PCs
and server technology,

121
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,970
that continued,

122
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,380
that design continued,

123
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,730
obviously we have multiple backup plans,

124
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,700
so we, you know, every one of our sites

125
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,810
heads back to Trenton

126
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,940
on either two or three
different platforms,

127
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,690
well, it's a hub and wheel,

128
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,710
it's also a lot of triangles in between,

129
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,049
where there is,

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,200
no single point of failure
getting back to us,

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,800
we do have a disaster recovery site,

132
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,640
where four times a year,

133
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,550
we fail our entire
system up to our DR site,

134
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,210
it allows us to go through
every bit of technology we have,

135
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,063
and bring our system back up,

136
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,530
as if our data center in Trenton was gone,

137
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,390
obviously having the cloud now

138
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,469
has created additional issues with DR,

139
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,143
as well as benefits with DR,

140
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,299
for our web applications,

141
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,870
we have around 150 web applications,

142
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,210
we are largely,

143
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,989
as you'll see in most government places,

144
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,210
we don't get rid of anything,

145
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,840
so we have everything
from cobalt.net Java,

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,549
few years ago, we made a huge investment

147
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,650
into business process modeling software,

148
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,200
we run on our Pega Platform,

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,450
that allowed us to do a lot of,

150
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,789
what we're able to accomplish

151
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,710
that last mark to get up and running,

152
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,760
and I'll talk about that in a few slides.

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,739
As I mentioned, limited mobile computing,

154
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,908
we were, you know, mostly
people sitting at their desks,

155
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:14,410
mobility was really, you
know, at home, on email,

156
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,250
otherwise I was, you know,
generally sitting at my desk

157
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,250
if you walked into our court
house in 2000, or in 2020,

158
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,170
you were largely, you know,

159
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,320
doing the same kind of
work sitting at a PC,

160
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,300
interacting with documents and data,

161
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,903
but not a lot has changed since then.

162
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,960
Our VPN was set up, we had the capacity,

163
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,320
we thought to do around 2,500 staff,

164
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,300
we were probably really,

165
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,320
we were closer to five or 600 at a time,

166
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,280
generally, we never saw
more than a hundred people

167
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,090
trying to connect through a VPN,

168
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,729
and those were largely IT
people working on the weekends,

169
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,120
coming in and doing
maintenance and other things.

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,030
One of the big things
that we had instituted,

171
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,000
was two factor authentication

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,730
and we had set up several
policies over the last few years

173
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,020
that anyone accessing any
judiciary application,

174
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,940
judiciary resource,

175
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,060
would be doing so during two factor,

176
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,050
and that was one of our huge benefits

177
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,980
we got throughout

178
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:21,440
our work that we were doing last spring,

179
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,030
was we followed our secure platforms,

180
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,849
if we had put policies in place

181
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,660
and had to cut corners we did it,

182
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,130
but we didn't do it in a way
that would affect security,

183
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,293
and that really allowed us to continue,

184
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,010
to actually place more security
onto our staff and network

185
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,970
as we broke down,

186
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,880
you know, the historic court walls

187
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,593
and started moving people
wherever they could work.

188
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,139
You want to go to the next Sajed?

189
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,223
- [Sajed] Yap.

190
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,340
- So how to run a court
in three days notice.

191
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,390
Back in March,

192
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,410
I was sitting on the Rutgers Golf Course,

193
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,660
I got a call from our
chief justice on a Sunday,

194
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,430
who said we're closing
down the courts tomorrow,

195
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,900
it was Sunday, I was on the eighth hole,

196
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,890
and I sat on a conference call with him

197
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,240
for the next two hours
as we finished our round

198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,400
and then an additional two hours,

199
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,590
and we walked through what
we were going to accomplish,

200
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,210
what we thought we were going to do,

201
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,470
and what we ended up doing,

202
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,890
were night and day difference

203
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,390
because even on that phone call,

204
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,490
we were still planning

205
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,370
on using our internal network,

206
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,600
we were still planning
on having the judges

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,590
sitting in the courtroom,

208
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,623
running our system using
the capacity of our network,

209
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:47,870
and the, you know, recordation software

210
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,870
that was going on in the courtrooms,

211
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,170
unfortunately, that all changed,

212
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,469
as everybody knows, New
York New Jersey area

213
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,810
was hit probably the hardest

214
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,050
in the country in the early days,

215
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,560
and after that call on
Sunday by about Wednesday,

216
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,530
the chief justice said,

217
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,770
now we're gonna be operating
completely remotely

218
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,752
and all that's gonna fall on
the backs of our IT staff.

219
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,260
And so what we did was we stepped back,

220
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,250
and I talked to my staff and I said,

221
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,950
we have to come up with plans

222
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,030
to be able to do three things,

223
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,403
the first is make IT more efficient,

224
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,160
to look where,

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,630
anywhere that we were running
systems that were redundant,

226
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,130
anything that we had to
spend our time focusing on,

227
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,230
keeping you know, two
staff doing the same thing,

228
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,160
let's get rid of all those
systems and cut costs,

229
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,770
let's do what we could to rewrite systems,

230
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,819
migrate them over to more modern platforms

231
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,180
and allow our staff to continue working,

232
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,000
one of the benefits was we
had migrated to the cloud,

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
by migrating to the cloud,

234
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,700
it allowed us to keep our
developers up and running,

235
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,980
they didn't have to come back

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,630
to the data center through a VPN,

237
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,689
they could connect directly to either AWS

238
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,510
or whatever platform they
were using to do their work.

239
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,930
We had a second challenge,

240
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,587
which was keep the windows
open at the courthouses,

241
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:12,587
you know, we had a fairly
extensive electronic court system

242
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,900
and it allowed us,

243
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,540
to file most documents electronically,

244
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,110
accept most payments electronically,

245
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,590
but as we were closing the courthouse,

246
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,760
we had to be able to do all
documents electronically

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,980
and all payments electronically.

248
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,010
One of my staff on a Friday
night came up with the idea

249
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,530
of the judiciary electronic
document submission

250
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,439
which was largely,

251
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,550
go to a website, file
something and pay for it,

252
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,550
and then we would handle the backend work,

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,810
even if it was manually,

254
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,290
at least it was electronic
and we could transition it,

255
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,810
and transfer it to staff
whenever it had come in,

256
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,380
and move it wherever the staff might be.

257
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,600
They actually had that
system up and running

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,803
and in production three days later,

259
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,219
it was crude but it was based
on a lot of the policies

260
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,770
and platforms that we had already put

261
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,810
into our electronic court system,

262
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,459
and what it was basically
meant to do was fill gaps,

263
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,270
fast forward to now it
no longer fills gaps,

264
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,069
it's actually gonna probably become,

265
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,699
our primary software,

266
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,680
and on how we're gonna this,

267
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,920
because it was built in such a modern way,

268
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,770
it doesn't have a lot of the complexity,

269
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,883
and a lot the baggage that
some of our own systems had.

270
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,313
Another thing we had to do,

271
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:37,240
is we had to move everybody
home almost overnight,

272
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,760
and as I mentioned, we
only had 2,500 laptops,

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,251
so how were we gonna accomplish that?

274
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,319
One of our tax work moms,

275
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,070
when they closed the
schools in New Jersey,

276
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,887
a single mom in our tax court asked,

277
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:53,670
"can I take my PC home and
connect it to my home network?"

278
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,933
And then use it to connect
back to us in some way,

279
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:59,342
when I heard that,

280
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,867
I went and spoke to my boss and said,

281
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,327
"if we allow this to happen,

282
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,280
"we've fixed our problem
with mobile devices."

283
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,550
We treated our PCs just like giant laptops

284
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,900
and sent them home,

285
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,280
the reason we were able to do that,

286
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,319
is Sajed and I came up with
a plan a few years before,

287
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,830
to encrypt every device in the judiciary,

288
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,230
whether it was a laptop or desktop,

289
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,700
so we knew that PC walking
out of the building

290
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,810
was already encrypted,

291
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,459
and we could protect the
data from the judiciary,

292
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,280
we knew when it connected back to us

293
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,560
we'd be protecting the transmission

294
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,750
from the person's house back to us,

295
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,490
and we knew we were in a good secure place

296
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,350
to allow that to happen.

297
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,030
I happen to live in a another county

298
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,560
beside where our home office is,

299
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,689
and I was driving some
laptops that night to drop off

300
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,400
to that county,

301
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,140
and as I pulled up outside the building

302
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,460
I saw hundreds of people
walking out with PCs

303
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,697
and sticking them in their
cars to take them home,

304
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,370
and that was the first
idea that I think I had,

305
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,790
and I was able to share
back with the chief justice

306
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,930
and administrative director,

307
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,680
that this was gonna work, that our people,

308
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,563
were going to you know,
take their devices home

309
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:13,723
and do whatever they could to
keep the judiciary running.

310
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,710
Another thing we had to do,

311
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,370
was for those staff that had PCs at home,

312
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,440
maybe they had their own PC,

313
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,230
we did run into a lot of problems

314
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,820
with people that had kids at home,

315
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,310
or spouses at home trying
to use their home PC,

316
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,609
to do their work or schoolwork.

317
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,440
But we looked to expand initially

318
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,700
our Citrix virtual desktop infrastructure,

319
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,630
and then ended up scrapping that,

320
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,470
and switched to a VMware VDI,

321
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,900
where we took from about
100 concurrent sessions

322
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,100
and brought that up to
1500 concurrent sessions,

323
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,100
we generally saw around
1450 concurrent sessions

324
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,373
throughout the day,

325
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,543
the one thing we did see was,

326
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,420
our staff hours because of
schoolwork and things like that,

327
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,620
staff a lot of times couldn't do the work

328
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,390
during their normal 8:30 to 4:30 day,

329
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,660
but instead what we see
is people logging in

330
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,130
as early as 6:00 a.m

331
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,640
and staying on as late as
10 to 11 o'clock at night,

332
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,640
we routinely saw 95 plus
percent of people connecting

333
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,150
either through the VPN or
coming in through the VDI

334
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,533
whether it was our laptop,
their desktop, et cetera.

335
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,770
Now as we took those desktops home

336
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,710
and took our laptops home,

337
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,490
we needed to increase
our capacity for VPN,

338
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,800
as I mentioned we had,

339
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,339
we thought we had around
2,500 connections,

340
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,270
it was probably closer

341
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,160
to seven or 800 connections at the time,

342
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,819
but we were able to almost overnight

343
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,870
take every server we had off the shelf

344
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,270
and just start throwing capacity,

345
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,560
we got it up to about 7,500,

346
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,229
between the 1500 BDIs and the 7,500 VPNs,

347
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,770
we were able to stay running,

348
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,030
when people a lot of times talked

349
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,569
about walking by those servers,

350
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,680
and that there might be flames
shooting out of the back,

351
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,370
they were so overworked,

352
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,480
but that gave us the brief bit of time,

353
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,990
which took about a week,

354
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,950
to then migrate some
of our VPN up into AWS,

355
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,140
again, we had the connection to AWS

356
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,060
through our Pega infrastructure,

357
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,099
and we were able to very quickly

358
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,190
create a secure VPN
infrastructure up in AWS

359
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,290
in about a little over a week,

360
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,910
and then migrate out a good
portion of our capacity

361
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,219
off of our infrastructure
or a data center,

362
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,600
and move it up there,

363
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
and then obviously that's
gonna be the future

364
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,130
as we, you know have a need in the future,

365
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,170
hopefully never again,

366
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,240
but if we have a need
to burst in the future,

367
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,630
we'll be doing it up in the cloud

368
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,630
and not in our facility.

369
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,520
Our biggest challenge,

370
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,530
was how are we gonna
run the courts remotely,

371
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,449
at the time, back in 2017
through an initiative

372
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,910
on criminal justice reform,

373
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,970
where we eliminated bail in New Jersey,

374
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,670
we were running virtual
courts on the weekends

375
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,609
just like we are today in
all the other capacities,

376
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,443
but we were probably doing

377
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:18,369
about 40 sessions a week at the time.

378
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,729
We had a spin that up and get
it up to about 400 sessions,

379
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,242
we got about 400 state judges,

380
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:29,242
and we did that by looking
at any available technology,

381
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,853
that was out there,

382
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,730
we were using teams at the time,

383
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,700
we had another vendor that we were using,

384
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,750
and then in came zoom,

385
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,270
zoom was able to burst and
handle the capacity we needed,

386
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,570
but we already had the
policies and procedures

387
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,883
and security metrics in place
in order to allow us to,

388
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,660
not move into these new technologies,

389
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,190
get them up and running,

390
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,890
get our staff trained
on them and move ahead,

391
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,430
I think just last week

392
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,870
we passed 250,000 remote
court events in the last year,

393
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,270
with around two and a
half million participants,

394
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,963
so, it's been very successful,

395
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,270
we're dabbling in things like trials,

396
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,020
but other than trials,

397
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,410
we've been able to accomplish

398
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,890
everything that we've
needed within the judiciary,

399
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,860
including some things like adoptions,

400
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,810
and other things at people's homes

401
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,743
which has been a big benefit to them.

402
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,443
And then,

403
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,320
our biggest wins for our staff,

404
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,530
was we migrated to teams in one day,

405
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,139
we were a Skype shop at the time

406
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,440
had about 150 users that
we had moved over to teams,

407
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,990
so we already had the infrastructure

408
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,560
in place to start moving,

409
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,389
but on a Thursday, I asked our staff

410
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,860
could they migrate all 10,000
users over on Saturday,

411
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,679
and they accomplished it,
thanks to Microsoft's help,

412
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,120
with that, what it allowed us to do,

413
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,929
is we run around 10,000
administrative meetings

414
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,090
between our staff on a weekly basis,

415
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,720
and those meetings don't
touch our data center,

416
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,180
they're able to go right
from person to person,

417
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,680
if they're outside of their building,

418
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,720
leveraging the Microsoft cloud,
Microsoft, as well as zoom,

419
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,870
all of our vendors have
been fantastic to deal with

420
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,500
as we ran into these challenges,

421
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,680
and tried to burst as quickly as we did,

422
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,010
and we wouldn't have been able to do it

423
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,640
without the entire
technology vendor community,

424
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,140
and I know everyone in the courts

425
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,970
as well as in another areas,

426
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,167
probably feels the same that,

427
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,540
you know, this whole
thing was only possible

428
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,530
because of what the technology
community did at the time

429
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,851
and how they got us up and running.

430
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,133
One of the things that we did do,

431
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,830
as we did all these
things, as I mentioned,

432
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,750
we kept security in mind,

433
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,430
and Sajed is gonna go through a couple

434
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,800
of the projects that we
ran in the last year,

435
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,290
just to make sure that not only,

436
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,700
were we at least keeping
our security the same

437
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,080
as it was when we were on prem,

438
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,884
but what we did to actually
expand and increase security,

439
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,760
as we started dealing with things

440
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,110
like what's going on in
people's houses, et cetera.

441
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,560
So, Sajed.

442
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,970
- Okay, thank you Jack.

443
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,240
- So, I mean, Jack was mentioning

444
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
that a lot happened during the pandemic,

445
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,260
there was clearly technologies
we already had available,

446
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,370
that we did,

447
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,429
the key ones he mentioned,

448
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,630
was the desktop encryption project,

449
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,950
we had been doing that for
the last several years,

450
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,190
and basically, you know,

451
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,970
we were able to take the desktops home

452
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,210
as a result of the encryption on address,

453
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,510
so that was a key one,

454
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,920
that infrastructure was already there,

455
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,850
the other one that we had been utilizing,

456
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,439
was the two factor auth, right?

457
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,680
Clearly it's critical function there,

458
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,662
we already had it for
several different systems

459
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:43,662
the internal users
meaning the court staff,

460
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,310
the expansion of that has continued on to,

461
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,639
additional applications that
are used by our partners,

462
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,010
or governmental partners,

463
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,280
such as police and attorneys
and so on and so forth,

464
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,670
so, that's been a key initiative,

465
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,293
obviously it requires significant,

466
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,860
you know, relationships with those folks,

467
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,500
and we have done been able to
successfully accomplish that.

468
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,440
There's a third piece of our security,

469
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,950
which was a network access control,

470
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,320
we're gonna get into that a bit more,

471
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,970
we have some key policies
we had created on that,

472
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,970
we'll get into that.

473
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,330
So one of the key things

474
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,570
we had been working on pre pandemic,

475
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:29,570
was looking very closely at
ports that needed to be blocked,

476
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,129
especially we were hearing
about DejaBlue, BlueKeep,

477
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,510
you know, ransomware,
using RDP, using SMB,

478
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,840
all of these types of different ports

479
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,560
that we were looking at,

480
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,240
and the moment that we were on VPN,

481
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,330
we have to look at that closer, okay?

482
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,810
In regard to judiciary the court staff,

483
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,970
VPN has been used,

484
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,860
we've used these scalar that has,

485
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,949
it does things like posture assessments,

486
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,060
the ability to check
for certain conditions

487
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,970
before you connect to our network,

488
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,880
obviously VDI is a big part of that,

489
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,670
that's also two part of two
factor we use that there,

490
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,210
and some of the two factor
projects that have included

491
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,265
like I was mentioning earlier,

492
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:09,350
have been towards all
New Jersey attorneys,

493
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,860
and our other intergovernmental partners

494
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,800
including police officers.

495
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,040
So with the next thing,

496
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,440
we are a year later,

497
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,370
we're approaching towards
the very end here,

498
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,229
but a year later March,

499
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,230
and Jack is gonna get further into that.

500
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:25,880
- So what can we do?

501
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,110
Obviously I mentioned we
run a few hundred thousand

502
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,199
remote quarter events,

503
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,460
what we've struggled with,

504
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,969
are our trials,

505
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,763
we've run some several trials
and several virtual trials,

506
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,448
it's really,

507
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:45,300
our concern is bringing in jurors,

508
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,669
New Jersey unfortunately,

509
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,550
I think right now has the highest

510
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,340
disease rate in the country,

511
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,980
we're still up in the red area,

512
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,770
we've done a fantastic job
getting the vaccines out,

513
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,910
I think we're crossing the 40% mark

514
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,160
in adults vaccinated in New Jersey,

515
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
but there's still hesitancy

516
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,780
to bring people back into our buildings,

517
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,940
so, our civil trials running
virtually have just started,

518
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,380
we're seeing a lot of success in them

519
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,100
but we have to make a move into criminal,

520
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,397
criminal is really our concern right now.

521
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,523
What I think is gonna happen long term,

522
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,240
we're going to see a lot of,

523
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,527
my boss calls it re imagining the courts,

524
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,190
we're going through and looking,

525
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,340
at every single thing we do,

526
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,149
we're doing it from the IT side saying,

527
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,470
what have we done,

528
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,660
what can we do better,

529
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,140
and what do we have to
institutionalize long-term

530
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,150
and make sure we put the appropriate

531
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,000
enterprise policies and security around,

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
we're doing the same thing
on the business side.

533
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,170
The days of the large,

534
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,730
you know, we'll call them cattle calls,

535
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,350
where you bring in 150
landlord tenant cases,

536
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,120
or 100 small claims cases,

537
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,260
or a municipal court

538
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,800
where you have 150 people showing up,

539
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,720
those days are gone,

540
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,420
we're not going to be
doing that in the future.

541
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,620
Our ability to offer things
like remote connectivity,

542
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,453
you know, actually,

543
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:12,960
if you have to go to
a court for a session,

544
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,793
just thinking about it,

545
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:15,379
you might have to take
a half day off work,

546
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,742
you'd have to go into the
county, go into the city,

547
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,860
you have to a a parking, et cetera.

548
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,949
For me what might be a five minute event,

549
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,500
well, if we could do
that remotely, we should,

550
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,360
and that's largely what my
boss has been looking like.

551
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,273
And then as well as with,

552
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,879
our security,

553
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,990
my boss has, you know,

554
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,260
since I was in Sajed's position,

555
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,530
has talked about a culture of security,

556
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,470
and we are in a culture of security,

557
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,270
where we're continuing to make sure,

558
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,120
that everything we do,

559
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,500
we look at security first
as we continue to go on.

560
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,660
A few of the things are
virtual private network,

561
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,310
virtual desktops,

562
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,970
making sure that, you
know, who's logging in,

563
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,230
we are instituting two factor both,

564
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,120
outside of the building
as well as on-prem,

565
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,030
making sure that,

566
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,110
we know what's coming into our building,

567
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,260
through network access control,

568
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,850
I mentioned in our
first slide, zero trust,

569
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,419
we're instituting zero trust,

570
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,100
so that we know how to deal in the future

571
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,419
with things like SolarWinds

572
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,000
and some of the other patterns
that Sajed is talking about.

573
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,100
Just making sure that
we're pushing the envelope

574
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,820
as much as we can,

575
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,250
to ensure that whatever we're doing,

576
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,850
we're doing securely because
we have the public's trust

577
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,763
and confidence in our data
and processes and procedures.

578
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,920
- Exactly, so one of the
key things we have done,

579
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,340
I mean Jack was mentioning,

580
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,040
in order to get, you know, look,

581
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,298
we were basically 100 year operation,

582
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:49,480
that was in person, right?

583
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,720
You came in, you saw court staff,

584
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,410
you saw juries, you saw
judges, you saw our attorneys,

585
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,600
you own one monolithic building,

586
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,580
and all of a sudden we
went remote overnight,

587
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,350
basically that's what happened, right?

588
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,580
And I'm sure that happened to
a number of different people,

589
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,831
however, there are a number
of different companies

590
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,959
and different people that
are at this conference here,

591
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,370
however, one of the key things with us,

592
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,909
in terms of the court system,

593
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,980
is our court system relies
on policies and procedures,

594
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,140
and court directives, and
rules and regulations,

595
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,370
that all are more or less, you know,

596
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,979
meant for in person, right?

597
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,880
So how do we now translate that

598
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,310
to a remote environment, right?

599
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,350
And just a very basic differences,

600
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,560
you know, Jack and I are
sitting in virtual places,

601
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,690
I mean physical places,

602
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,740
but you know, we're in different places,

603
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,437
now inside of a court system,

604
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:39,449
we would have been in the
same physical location,

605
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,380
and if I had to raise
my hand in a certain way

606
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,550
and so on and so forth,

607
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,919
but now the moment I go remote, you know,

608
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,650
my network connection, my
VPN, you know, my bandwidth,

609
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,620
all of these things could
lead to problems with justice

610
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,110
which is our topic today, right?

611
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,530
How does all of this
technology lead to that?

612
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,090
So for us, one of the most critical things

613
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,689
is keeping the technology
up, Jack mentioned that,

614
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,620
and keeping the security ongoing,

615
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,219
and so bluntly very directly
it's encryption, right?

616
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,053
It's two factor,

617
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:11,330
it's a lot of these very broad
services that are critical,

618
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,949
so we have a significant expansion in VPN,

619
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,380
it's gone to the cloud,

620
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,520
it's between multi-cloud environments,

621
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
it's a lot going on there, right?

622
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,830
And we have gotten to that,

623
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,010
part of what the cloud has helped us with,

624
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,200
is taking that load, that bandwidth,

625
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,197
those issues off of our on prem network,

626
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:33,810
and has further, you
know, made it disparate,

627
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,030
so, we are able to use
loads elsewhere, right?

628
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,520
Bandwidth elsewhere,

629
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,549
so VPN has been a critical feature,

630
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,410
VDI also critical.

631
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,850
Jack, you wanna get into that bit?

632
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,219
'Cause we were not doing VDI
pre pandemic and now we are,

633
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,120
and it's been a huge
help from an end-user.

634
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,953
- Sure,

635
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:55,932
so just quickly I mentioned
the VDI use for our staff,

636
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:58,670
and how that's allowed
staff to keep working,

637
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,740
but the members of the
public also have the ability

638
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
to come into the courthouses throughout,

639
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,520
and set up public access terminals,

640
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,353
one of,

641
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:11,755
our big things in the
judiciary is transparency,

642
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,100
you know, there's two
sides to every story,

643
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,919
and we make sure everybody
hears every story,

644
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,070
so using our VDI encryption
we've been able to expand,

645
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,649
our access to public access systems,

646
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,340
and have people come in,

647
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,919
again securely access case management data

648
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,980
on whether it's their case or other cases,

649
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,520
and we found that the
VDI has been a great tool

650
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,410
for us to use because
it allows us to do it,

651
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,060
similar to what we're
doing in the courthouse,

652
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,909
but doing it in a very secure manner.

653
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,923
- Exactly,

654
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,920
so VDI has been critical,

655
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,240
so network access control,

656
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,073
I mean this is something,

657
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:49,970
one of the things that I'm gonna is that,

658
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,570
if security was done during the pandemic,

659
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,659
it was probably too late,
the way that I'm viewing it.

660
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,940
So one of the critical things,

661
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,441
if you open up any of the
controls that, you know, you have,

662
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,660
you have NIST CSF, you have PCI DSS,

663
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,930
you have ISO any control,

664
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,280
one of the top controls,
number one actually,

665
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,450
not even top control, at
the foundational level is,

666
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,910
do you know where all your
hardware and software is, right?

667
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,743
Basically, right?

668
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:15,010
Do you know where everything is,

669
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,240
how are you gonna secure something

670
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,510
if you don't know where it is?

671
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,890
So, we have been working
on network access control

672
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,090
just from a visibility standpoint
early on, before pandemic,

673
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,525
and we had seen our network,

674
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:29,720
Jack had mentioned about
750 different locations,

675
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,610
we needed to see everything, right?

676
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,189
And make sure that everything was visible,

677
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,970
so that had provided
us controls with that.

678
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,860
The second part of network
access control was the patching.

679
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,360
One of the key things we had done

680
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,639
from a security standpoint,

681
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,800
something, you know, we were
making sure we were doing,

682
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,760
when we were seeing DejaBlue, BlueKeep,

683
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,420
all of these types of
vulnerabilities in RDP,

684
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,180
were mobile RDPs, right?

685
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,680
We're mobile, you know,
ransomware so on and so forth,

686
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,630
was our patching, right?

687
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,340
So, but then time to time

688
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,379
people would either
have those computers off

689
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,820
or we needed to make
sure they were patched,

690
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,419
so what we did was our
network access control

691
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,600
was able to go in to every device,

692
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,209
and if you hadn't been
patched up to a certain level

693
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,870
then we just turned on the patching

694
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,510
and then you got your patching, right?

695
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,030
So that was a critical one,

696
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,350
again, same thing for antivirus,

697
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,010
fourth one, and this was pre pandemic,

698
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,350
but again it's useful all the time,

699
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,360
we have 750 locations on
combination of local courts,

700
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,120
and more superior, higher level courts,

701
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,889
and so, time to time, we had seen,

702
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,547
you know, people plugging in devices,

703
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:39,260
"we're like, oh, we don't like this."

704
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,879
So our policies were,

705
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,450
any windows devices that were plugged in,

706
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,800
would be blocked basically
that were not ours,

707
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,300
meaning if they were not court
they would be blocked, right?

708
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,750
And so that was a third policy,

709
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,040
and one of the more critical ones,

710
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,670
and again, this is a
whole stack of things,

711
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,680
is any IOT, anything that's
plugged in, that's not ours,

712
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,850
we immediately block it,

713
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,780
that did create some control things,

714
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,889
especially in pandemic,

715
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,940
because when an analyst or
an IT person goes on site,

716
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,870
they have to put in a ticket,

717
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,889
they say, "hey, you know,
I'm putting this device in,"

718
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,050
it could be a TV,

719
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,790
and then we open it for them
and then they put it in.

720
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,290
So it created an extra step,

721
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,030
but it was a worthwhile step

722
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,710
in regards to the larger picture.

723
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,000
So with the next thing,

724
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,710
Jack will get into some numbers,

725
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,220
and there's a quote here
by a Nobel prize winner,

726
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,347
Richard Feynman,

727
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:28,920
"the first principle is
you must not fool yourself,

728
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,800
and you're the easiest person to fool."

729
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,633
And Peter Drucker,

730
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,260
"if you can't measure it,
you cannot improve it."

731
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,770
So with our measurements,

732
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,520
Jack is gonna get into some
of our key measurements here.

733
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,040
- So really quickly,

734
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,139
as I mentioned back in February last year,

735
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,760
we were about 1% of our
people working from home,

736
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,420
we quickly made that 100%,

737
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,010
we've had a couple of starts
and stops in the last year,

738
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,700
as the various waves have come through,

739
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,840
but we're still sitting at about 10%

740
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,280
of our staff working in the office,

741
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,763
with everybody else
working at home right now.

742
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,090
The question is what's on the next slide,

743
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,430
if you want to just pop into the slide.

744
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:08,050
- [Sajed] Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

745
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,570
- The next thing is is
where are we heading?

746
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,139
And as I mentioned judge Gren,

747
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,710
has a committee on re-imagining the court,

748
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,800
we have sub committees, judges, staff,

749
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,690
members of the public,
attorneys, the bar, et cetera.

750
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,523
And again,

751
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,580
we're looking at reviewing everything,

752
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,429
I think if we were,

753
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,930
asking this question of how many people

754
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,220
might be working at home last spring,

755
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,510
we would have thought it
would've been about 80, 20,

756
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,990
80% in the building,

757
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,770
maybe we would have been able
to have 20% people off site,

758
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,050
there was still a hesitancy,

759
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,950
even as we were in the middle of moving

760
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,930
100% of our people and processes off site,

761
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,980
as to what would happen.

762
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,280
I think as we drift into
the next couple months,

763
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,550
next six months, we're gonna see,

764
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,409
that number is gonna
change to about 60, 40,

765
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,220
if not go further,

766
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,910
we have seen a lot of benefits
of our staff being remote,

767
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,480
working at home,

768
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,120
the additional hours of support

769
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,199
that we're able to offer the public,

770
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,960
and I think, you know, in the long run

771
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,900
we're gonna see about a 60, 40 split,

772
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,270
where we'll have about 60%
of our people in the building

773
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,350
of 40% remote.

774
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,183
- Exactly,

775
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,030
and so these are some of the numbers,

776
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,730
that, you know, Jack was speaking on,

777
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,920
we basically went over 90,

778
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,300
you can see the numbers down there,

779
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,567
from March 16, as we found
everybody in the States,

780
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,103
you know, found out at a larger level,

781
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:32,960
and so we would took immediately

782
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,420
over the weekend and onward,

783
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,710
the numbers kept increasing.

784
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,830
So some of the security numbers

785
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,610
as we were approaching the end of this,

786
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,419
some of the key things we saw was,

787
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,620
as you can see by these graphs,

788
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,229
here, this is by Shodan,

789
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,800
you know, does the public scans and stuff.

790
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,300
COVID related domains, right?

791
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,659
COVID-19 related domains,

792
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,283
you see how much has shot up 4000%, right?

793
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,890
Within basically a couple of weeks,

794
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,050
and so we saw a lot of that,

795
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,940
so these are the things we
were paying attention to,

796
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,450
we also started to increase email scanning

797
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,200
for domains like this, right?

798
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,160
'Cause we were noticing,

799
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,500
that there was a huge
county-level, New Jersey level,

800
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,440
all of these things were going on,

801
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,300
again from Shodan,

802
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,863
we definitely saw uptakes
in January regarding,

803
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,620
I'm sorry, this was a year before,

804
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,400
but in terms of remote port scanning RDP,

805
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,300
we know about that from
the other vulnerabilities

806
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,133
that were there.

807
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:26,469
And so our security was largely focused

808
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:30,719
on looking at the major
drivers in compromises

809
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,669
which were vulnerabilities
in regard to RDP, SMB,

810
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,149
we definitely had the visibility,

811
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,250
so we are able to make the
necessary policies there,

812
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,110
and since we already had the encryption

813
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,030
and the infrastructure for two factor,

814
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,593
we were able to do that.

815
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,170
