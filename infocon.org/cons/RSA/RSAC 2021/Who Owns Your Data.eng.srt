1
00:00:01,492 --> 00:00:02,610
- Hi, my name is Steve Black

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,660
and I'd like to thank the organizers

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,760
for inviting me to present today.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,309
If you have questions,
please put them in the chat.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,640
From time to time my first
year law students ask me

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,250
why they have to study property.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,240
And from time to time when
I'm speaking with a CEO

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,299
or a CIO, they will ask me
how they avoid getting sued

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,930
following a breach.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,050
I'd like to give you one possible answer

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,713
to both of these very serious questions.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,290
So it's an age, old story.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,190
Somebody breaks something, and
then somebody suggests that

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,903
there ought to be a law to fix it.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,300
Except in this case everyone
is rushing in to fix it.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,390
And if you were one of my law students

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,750
I would tell you that this is wonderful

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,230
because more law means
more work for lawyers.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,419
And the map that I'm
showing right now tracks

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,360
some of the many laws that we look at

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,179
so that clients can number
one comply with practices

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,910
where they do business
and by that I mean if

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,630
where they're collecting
data from citizens

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,009
and number two plan which countries

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,500
they want to do business with

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,460
or which countries they want to avoid.

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,899
And number three advocate
with those governments

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,170
for the types of laws that they want

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,220
and seriously think about that.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,610
If more than 100 countries
all try and pass laws

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,270
they're not going to agree 100%

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,250
and some of those countries
will try and outdo others

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,020
and some won't really
care and it's a legal mess

34
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,839
or a legal playground depending
on your point of view.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,280
On the other hand if
you're one of my clients

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,660
it really is a mess.

37
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,130
How in the world, pun
intended, do you comply with

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,009
all of these laws?

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,010
From Japan to Brazil to China
to the U.S and in the U.S

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,950
we've got many many laws
and many more coming

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,950
as states see the impending
railroad coming up.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,979
And so today's quotes
that I'm going to show

43
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,692
on the next slide are courtesy
of the Princess Bride.

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,540
And quite frankly, this is good advice

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,549
when you're dealing with
more than 120 countries

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,283
all trying to regulate similar practices.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,200
So I actually do love legal history.

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,500
It wasn't always the case

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,440
but I have found a new passion in it

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,150
so we're gonna start back in
1753 with William Blackstone

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,080
who wrote that property
is that relationship

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,973
between a person and a thing, my pen.

53
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,390
And then we're gonna fast forward.

54
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,119
Right that makes sense to
a lot of us we think about

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,950
you know, I own this or, you
know, I wish I owned that

56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,072
we're talking about things primarily.

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,880
And beginning in 1913 there was a shift

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,010
and Wesley Hoffeld wrote that

59
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,470
property is really
relationships between people

60
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,540
and what he was talking
about are rights and powers

61
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,220
and privileges and immunities.

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,700
And for example, if I own a piece of land

63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,519
and you're trying to trespass

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,360
I have the right to exclude you

65
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,923
who has no right to be on the property.

66
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,260
And then by 1961, we arrive
at this understanding that

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,730
property is a bundle of incidents

68
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,340
and we're gonna talk about
more about those incidents

69
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,100
but you can think about
those as a bundle of rights.

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,340
And what we're going
to do with those rights

71
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,770
is going to be very interesting.

72
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,680
So if you can with me for just a moment

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,230
let's think about this.

74
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,769
You've got a whole bunch of countries

75
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,400
passing a whole bunch
of data protection laws

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,270
and they give people rights to do things

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,380
with their data or, you know,

78
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,630
keep other people from
doing things with their data

79
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,859
and that makes property
because now I've got the rights

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,713
to the data and suddenly
we've got property.

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,800
Before this worldwide
interest in data legislation

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,579
data was just data.

83
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,409
Does it really have to be property

84
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,464
and I'm hearing my first year law students

85
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,592
ask that question.

86
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,540
So in 1986, a Mr. Lucas bought two lots

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,270
in coastal South Carolina.

88
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,680
And he was gonna build single family homes

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,705
on those contiguous parcels.

90
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,870
At the time, there was
no regulation to stop him

91
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,220
from doing that.

92
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,960
But two years later in 1988,
the state legislature enacted

93
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,140
the beach front management
act, which kept him from

94
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,380
building any permanent
structure on his properties

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,030
and he filed suit and
said, hey you know what?

96
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,710
Even though that may have
been a waffle exercise

97
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,623
of state authority,

98
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:04,410
you've, you've ruined my
vacation property, right?

99
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,233
You've taken away all economic value

100
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,320
and he thought that that was a taking

101
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,520
under the 5th and 14th amendment

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,510
and we're not gonna go through

103
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,370
the constitutional
intricacies of this suit

104
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,580
but we will note that
both the Justice Scalia

105
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,763
writing for the majority
and Justice Blackmun

106
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:26,763
writing for himself in
a dissent said that,

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,080
I mean they used the
phrase the bundle of rights

108
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,590
and Scalia said
understandings of our citizens

109
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,729
regarding the content of,
and the state's power over

110
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,840
the bundle of rights that they acquire

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,986
when they're (indistinct)
title is interesting to us

112
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:44,540
and so that's Lucas V. South
Carolina coastal council

113
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,683
and that was a 1992 case.

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,719
So we're looking at
legislation creates rights,

115
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,310
rights create property.

116
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,783
Even if we're not intending to
necessarily create property.

117
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,171
So if we're going to use
these types of words,

118
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,903
we probably ought to
figure out what they mean.

119
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,859
So some of the rights that we talk about.

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,930
We'll start with the right to exclude

121
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,430
'cause that was in the Lucas case.

122
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,070
One of the big things that
the dissent was harping on

123
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,700
was yeah but he still had
the right to keep people

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,770
off the property so let's talk about

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,770
what the right to exclude really means.

126
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,409
With land I can tell you
to stay off or get off.

127
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,270
Does that mean the same thing with data?

128
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,169
So if it's property I should
be able to exclude others

129
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,170
from my personal private
information but once they have it

130
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,533
what then?

131
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,700
Both the CCPA and the GDPR
give private individuals

132
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,360
rights to exclude but does that mean that

133
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,630
I can make somebody forget what they saw?

134
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,573
And that's a question yet to be decided.

135
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,240
And this slide I'm gonna admit

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,030
is a little bit obtuse even for me.

137
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,900
So Obiwan does the
little Jedi trick, right?

138
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,020
And the stormtroopers completely forget

139
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,030
the question that they were asking.

140
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,580
Does data work like a Jedi mind trick?

141
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,390
Can I make people forget what they saw?

142
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,780
Now land is much easier.

143
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,559
You know, if you're on my
property I can kick you off.

144
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,430
So if exclusion or privacy is to have

145
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,341
any real meaning for us
doesn't that require us

146
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,260
to perform Jedi mind tricks?

147
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,594
Or do we consider the right to exclude

148
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:42,083
after the data has been seen
to be completely illusory?

149
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay so this slide actually
has a different title

150
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,200
I mean this is fine here

151
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,469
but I'm gonna call this data is sticky.

152
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,720
So I don't know if anyone's
ever had one of these little

153
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,710
sticky hands that you know
they stick to the wall

154
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,030
and stick to your sister and
all kinds of other things.

155
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,450
What do I mean by stickiness?

156
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,460
So if I own a car and I
want to sell it to you

157
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,820
once the sale is done I
don't retain any rights

158
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,849
and there's that word again, in your car.

159
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,430
I can't walk over and say, hey
great car I used to drive it

160
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,890
I'm just gonna take it
out for a spin again.

161
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,810
We really frown on that in the law.

162
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,513
But data is weird.

163
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,750
Data is sticky and again this is my term

164
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,000
not any legislative, you
know, action or whatever

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,420
so if you're gonna use it in an article

166
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,870
you can cite to me, I'm
perfectly okay with that.

167
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,789
Section 1798.120 of the
CCPA says this, quote,

168
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,680
a consumer shall have
the rights at any time

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,650
to direct a business that
sells personal information

170
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,980
about the consumer to third parties

171
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,830
not to sell the consumer's
personal information.

172
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,260
And just one more time for good measure

173
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,970
so we can appreciate that.

174
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,730
A consumer should have
the right at any time

175
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,730
to direct a business that
sells personal information

176
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,280
about that consumer to
third parties to not sell

177
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,213
the consumer's personal information.

178
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:14,090
If I sell a car I give up all rights.

179
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,880
I could transfer IP to you
and mostly give up all rights.

180
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,268
The mostly is in some
countries, they recognize

181
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:25,830
an artist's moral rights
and that really means that

182
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,320
if an artist is creating a body of work

183
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,430
and someone that they licensed the work to

184
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,719
or sell the work to is
using, or misusing that IP

185
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,810
to harm the artists'
image or their reputation

186
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,699
then maybe they can,
you know, claw it back.

187
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,250
U.S really doesn't
subscribe to that theory

188
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,210
but we do have this data stickiness

189
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,140
and this legislative stickiness
is fairly unique in the law

190
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,923
and it begs the question
whether data can be sold at all.

191
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,970
And we should talk
about slicing and dicing

192
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,450
and we had a lot more
time in this presentation

193
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,400
maybe even days, we could talk about

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,010
how other types of property

195
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,939
can get sliced into different pieces.

196
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,620
So for example, if I own
land I could keep the land

197
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,330
for 10 years and then give it to you

198
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,670
and, you know, we would each own the land

199
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,030
but at different points in time

200
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,370
or we could do something different

201
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,170
where I get 40% of the
land and you get 60% now

202
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,640
so we're sharing it now or, you
know, if we wanna go into IP

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,020
I get to use the performance
rights of the song that you own

204
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,970
but not the publication
rights and so on and so forth

205
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,026
and now that I think about it

206
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:36,392
some types of property are weird too.

207
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,830
And property has a right
of non-use or idleness

208
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,940
and what do I mean by that?

209
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,790
So if I buy land or a car

210
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,579
I don't have to do anything with it.

211
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,710
That birthday gift that
your aunt bought you

212
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,390
for your last birthday,
you didn't really want

213
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,120
and you still haven't opened the box

214
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,670
it's perfectly okay to keep it in the box.

215
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,402
The property police are not
going to make you use it.

216
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,370
Data, can you really tell
people not to touch it

217
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,390
and what does that mean?

218
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,853
Once you've seen it that's
the use of the property.

219
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,663
And now we're just getting warmed up.

220
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,060
So data is a complex concept
from a legal point of view.

221
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,530
It represents information about a subject

222
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,959
held by a collector or
information about a subject

223
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,140
held by a collector that
is now being processed

224
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,080
by a processor but both
subject and collector

225
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,310
and the processor have
interest in the information.

226
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,180
So we can talk about data mutuality.

227
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,829
So for example, I have
a social security number

228
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,840
because the government made me get one.

229
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,030
I have a driver's license
for the same reason

230
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,240
and I have credit cards.

231
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,620
All of those have numbers
and the question is

232
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,620
are those numbers mine or
the governments or the banks?

233
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,820
And we may wanna know the
answer to that question

234
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,433
because data equals privacy.

235
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,940
So if we understand the
concept of mutuality correctly

236
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,120
we would understand this
quote from a 1960 case

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,280
entitled Bradley V Cowls which said

238
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,500
guarantee of the right of privacy

239
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,210
is not a guarantee of hermetic seclusion.

240
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,750
We live in a society geared toward,

241
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,880
geared in the opposite direction.

242
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,130
A society that makes public demands

243
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,250
and imposes public duties.

244
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,140
So in Bradley the name
and address of the mother

245
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,640
of a 14 year old who had
been murdered was published

246
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,180
in an interview with two
of the men who were accused

247
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,380
of committing the crime.

248
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,283
Does a private citizen
have rights in her privacy?

249
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,620
And the Bradley case cited two other cases

250
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,690
and the first was Ike
V. Park Dog Food Company

251
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,930
which held that at least in Illinois

252
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,250
you can't take someone's photo

253
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,250
for your own advertising campaign

254
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,820
and that's what the dog
food company had done.

255
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,890
They'd taken somebody's photo
and used it without permission

256
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,490
to promote a product.

257
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,910
But Bradley also cited Anoreno in which

258
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,600
a magazine ran a story that was entitled

259
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,550
if you love me slip me a gun.

260
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,469
And they printed the photo
of a widow whose husband

261
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,740
had been a police
detective who was killed.

262
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,263
And again, does a private
citizen have rights?

263
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:41,010
So strangely enough, these cases lead us

264
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,189
to an interesting question.

265
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,513
Who owns a paparazzi photograph?

266
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,050
So before the current climate
of rampant data regulation

267
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,410
we would have said the federal
copyright statute said that

268
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,142
the person who took the photo
is the owner of the photo.

269
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,990
Except in 2017, Chloe Kardashian was sued

270
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,540
by Exposure Photos, a
paparazzi site that took

271
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,959
a picture of her with her sister

272
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,800
and Chloe reposted the picture

273
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,699
cropping out the copyright notice

274
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,770
and the two ended up settling
but a little bit later,

275
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,930
Gigi Hadid another
international supermodel

276
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,859
had a similar conflict with the magazine.

277
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,440
She posted one of the paparazzi photos

278
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,630
that they had featured
of herself on Instagram

279
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,883
and cropped out the copyright notice.

280
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,850
They sued her.

281
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,530
She said, I didn't
infringe on your copyright

282
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,760
because it was a picture
of me and in fact,

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,950
the only reason that it was
an interesting picture of me

284
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,410
is because of my body of work
and because I'm so famous.

285
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,410
So if anything it was
a collaborative process

286
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,810
between the photographer and me

287
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,599
and we're back to this
concept of data mutuality

288
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,243
which is hmm, who really
does own, you know

289
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,310
something that we're fighting about here?

290
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,010
That case was dismissed because

291
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,340
Exclusive, the paparazzi company,

292
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,670
didn't file a copyright registration

293
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,579
and so you know we still
have this issue out there of

294
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,580
what do we do with photos
that could be personal data

295
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,483
at the same time they could
be the subject of copyright?

296
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,680
And as long as we're at it

297
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,819
let's talk about sharing information.

298
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,539
So if you really wanna know these things

299
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,490
and you have some free time on your hands

300
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,960
September 9th is the
most popular birthday.

301
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,230
And according to one site that I looked at

302
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,230
Mary Smith is a name shared
by just shy of 20,000 people

303
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,970
and California is our biggest state.

304
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,570
So what, a lot of people
have that information.

305
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,570
As you begin to combine the
information together however

306
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,080
then we start to say, well
is this really identifying

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,380
a particular person or persons?

308
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,200
Do we share the data that we
consider to be most private

309
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,123
and personal?

310
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,400
And as long as we're talking about sharing

311
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,600
and people who aren't
really interested in sharing

312
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,560
we have to go back to my poor
1L law students who ask me

313
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,619
if they really do have to study property

314
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,280
and we have to talk about
a couple of rules that may

315
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,180
or may not have anything
to do with data whatsoever

316
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,760
but are favorites of professors
who like to torture students

317
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,439
and in the interest of not
torturing you overtly today

318
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,070
I'm gonna keep it really short.

319
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,500
But the rule of capture usually starts

320
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,660
with a case like Pearson D Post

321
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,070
in which a couple of individuals decided,

322
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,110
hey it looks like a wonderful Saturday

323
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,130
so we're gonna go out fox hunting
and that's with the hounds

324
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,350
and the horses and the
horns, and, you know

325
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,710
the idyllic British
countryside and off they go

326
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,590
and they find a hapless fox
and they start chasing it.

327
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,650
When lo and behold out of the woods comes

328
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,270
the other gentleman who
happens to see the fox

329
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,210
takes the shot, kills the
fox and carries it off.

330
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,880
At which point the hunters
on the horse then say,

331
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,540
wait a minute that's our fox.

332
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,000
And the gentleman with
the gun says really?

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,319
'Cause I'm holding it and it's dead.

334
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,099
And this is where the torture
begins for law students

335
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,699
but it's an interesting case for us

336
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,723
because is data like a
fox existing in the wild?

337
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,180
The second rule that we
really should talk about

338
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,210
is the rule of finding.

339
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,670
And you'll recall that we talked about

340
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,930
property being relationships.

341
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,130
So the question is, if I find something

342
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,480
I can have greater rights

343
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,300
against some people who aren't finders

344
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,040
but lesser rights against people
who are owners of property

345
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,050
and that you know boggles
our mind how you can have

346
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,220
more ownership in property
depending on your relationship

347
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,963
to the others who may have
rights in that same property.

348
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,510
What does that mean with data?

349
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,050
Is it in the wild undiscovered
and ready to be captured?

350
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,669
Is it lost and ready to be found?

351
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,187
Did I abandon it

352
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,723
and do these old legal rules
even make sense for us?

353
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,470
So while we're asking these questions

354
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,910
maybe we ought to start figuring out

355
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,843
what phrases we really need
to become familiar with.

356
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,800
Starting with, what do
we mean by ownership?

357
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,690
So John Locke wrote quote

358
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,620
he that encloses land
and has a greater plenty

359
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,129
of the conveniences of life from 10 acres

360
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,460
than he could have from
100 acres left in nature

361
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,510
may truly be said to
give 90 acres to mankind.

362
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,190
I am not sure about his math there.

363
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,610
For his labor now supplies
him with provisions

364
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,649
out of 10 acres which
were but the product of

365
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,243
100 lying in common.

366
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,430
So the question we can ask
is, is data like fallow land?

367
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,643
Or if I collect it, is it mine?

368
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,153
If I observe it is it mine?

369
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,889
If I derive it or combine it, is it mine?

370
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,450
If I create it, is it mine?

371
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,340
And all of those questions may have

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,483
the same infuriating answer, it depends.

373
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,320
So we could assume and I'm just gonna

374
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,540
pull some cases out here
and if you are interested

375
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,680
ask me in the chat or
contact me via email later

376
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,730
I'd be happy to give you
the sites to any of these

377
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,730
but you know, if I create a
theme song for you or a logo

378
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,947
or a color, not many of us know that

379
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:59,409
you can actually create
a color and trademark it

380
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,223
or a dance move is it mine or is it yours?

381
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,650
In 1971 Carolyn Davidson
was a graphic design student

382
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,813
at Portland State.

383
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,310
In 1969, two years earlier
she had met Phil Knight

384
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,820
the then assistant
professor at Portland State

385
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,110
who would go on to
found Blue Ribbon Sports

386
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,270
and then a little company we know as Nike.

387
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,129
Knight knew Davidson was in
search of some extra funds

388
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,780
as all students tend to be.

389
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,190
So he asked her to help
him out on some projects

390
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,500
at a rate of wait for it, $2 an hour.

391
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,333
Woohoo.

392
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,140
So she charged him for 17
and a half hours of work

393
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,893
and was paid by check of $35.

394
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,440
He was staring down a deadline.

395
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,310
He had shoe boxes in Mexico
that really needed a logo

396
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,540
and needed to be printed.

397
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,620
He needed a decision so
he grabbed her rendering

398
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,919
of the swoosh and said, quote,

399
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,810
I don't love it but it will grow on me.

400
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
True story. That starts us
asking some of these questions.

401
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,810
Yeah if we think about data mutuality

402
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,120
and if we think about others creating data

403
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,899
or sharing data who really he owns it

404
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,230
does your email address
really belong to you?

405
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,600
And by the way, Google if you're listening

406
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,469
I have some other theories
for you and call me, right?

407
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,230
You have my email address.

408
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,513
Literally you have my email address.

409
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,350
Or on the other hand if I happen to own

410
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,649
the Twitter handle real Donald
Trump does it belong to me

411
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,163
or can it be shut down
at any point in time?

412
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,790
If you work for a company that does

413
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,110
a lot of data collection, what do you do

414
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,530
if the law says the data
belongs to someone else?

415
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,860
Hold on for two slides

416
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,209
we're gonna get to the
answer to that question.

417
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,550
So some of the data protection
laws refer to household data.

418
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,310
That's interesting concept

419
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,129
as long as we're creating
new property out of nothing

420
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,417
what in the world is household data?

421
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,050
And this is data that
can identify individuals

422
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,639
who live together in a household.

423
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,570
And then my question is, so who owns that?

424
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,342
What if I live in a
household with children?

425
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,399
You may recall that the
law protects children

426
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,290
and their data and their online presence.

427
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,110
So can I consent to the
use of data that is shared

428
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,810
with children without implicating CAPA

429
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,233
or any of the other children's
data protection schemes?

430
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,730
If that wasn't clear for those
of you who work for companies

431
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,330
that collect data or who
have apps that collect data,

432
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,149
and you think, aha we only sell to adults

433
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,620
so we don't need to worry about

434
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,620
children's data protection schemes

435
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,040
you may be sadly mistaken.

436
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,020
Once the law starts labeling
things as household data

437
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,100
if there are children in the household

438
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,983
your life just got complicated.

439
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,043
You're welcome.

440
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,190
Some of you, we live in households

441
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,710
with the significant other.

442
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,240
What's hers is hers so what's mine is hers

443
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,530
and if there's a question it's hers.

444
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,114
Can I consent to have
someone use household data

445
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:26,270
that I share?

446
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,500
In the legal world we
would usually take a belt

447
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,170
and suspenders approach to that

448
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,120
and so what we would do is make sure that

449
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,678
everybody who possibly could own something

450
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,540
signed off on our use of
something and as a data collector

451
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,500
what does that mean for you?

452
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,970
That gets to be a thorny
problem because number one

453
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,010
your clients may not want to
tell you if they have children

454
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,760
or a significant other and
you may be thinking correctly

455
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,870
in some instances that
I really don't wanna

456
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,689
ask that question and
number three you're thinking

457
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,690
maybe the law is bad by
even having shared data.

458
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,560
And the question is, can we get around it?

459
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,730
Because once we think
about data as property

460
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,740
we start to think about
data as shared property

461
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,690
and I have an address and
that can be a physical address

462
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,890
in which case all the
persons who live here

463
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,270
in my physical address share
that piece of information

464
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,580
but I also have online addresses

465
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,840
and if I share those at any point in time

466
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,669
do they become shared data
and as a data collector

467
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,370
do I need to start thinking about

468
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,080
my processes of data sharieness?

469
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,310
That's not a word I just made it up.

470
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,909
And for those of you
who are thinking ahead

471
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,740
because that's the kind
of person that you are

472
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,030
you're thinking about, hey Professor Black

473
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,360
some of these data
protection schemes require us

474
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,296
to erase data and how
do I erase shared data?

475
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:53,723
And my answer is, that's
a really good question.

476
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,800
This slide also has a funny
subtitle but just for me

477
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,379
which is robots are cool but really

478
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,962
should they be writing
slogans or more to the point

479
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:12,962
if my robot/AI/whatever
creates data who owns it?

480
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,620
Well this slogan was
actually written by AI.

481
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,875
In the U.S the copyright
law usually says that

482
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,900
if you create a creative work

483
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,183
copyright automatically attaches.

484
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,753
To whom? To the creator.

485
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,703
Who's the creator of AI derived poems?

486
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,729
If that's not interesting
or scary enough for you

487
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,440
let me go a step further.

488
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,170
So what if my driverless car
which for our purposes today

489
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm gonna name Frida takes
photos of all she sees

490
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,700
around us with her 27 cameras.

491
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,620
When she's not driving me
around in her free time

492
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,120
she collates those into travel videos

493
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,719
and uploads those to YouTube

494
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,750
where they go viral
among all her followers

495
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,760
who also happen to be driverless cars.

496
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,310
I don't know who watches
viral AI car videos

497
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,129
but somebody is going to.

498
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,350
So she gets 10 million followers

499
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,659
and YouTube starts sending her checks

500
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,140
which aren't really
checked because seriously

501
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,520
how can my car cash her own checks right?

502
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,133
So they're auto-deposited.

503
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,650
Okay that's the dorky part of the humor

504
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,660
and I'm just gonna stop.

505
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,460
Auto-deposited for those of
you who are watching this later

506
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,950
you're gonna pause here and think about

507
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,380
what in the world is he talking about?

508
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,430
Let me ask you a question.

509
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,430
If that AI generated data
starts generating money

510
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,753
whose money is it?

511
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,000
As a tax attorney can she
claim me as a dependent?

512
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,480
So these are gonna be
really fascinating questions

513
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,470
that are gonna come up in your future

514
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,173
and this is what happens when
you make data into property.

515
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,360
So at this point, I'm gonna refer back to

516
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,459
how we started all this mess.

517
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,300
Somebody breached a computer system

518
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,120
and took data that didn't belong to them.

519
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,550
However the organization
that own the computer system

520
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,110
didn't really own the data either.

521
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,070
So what we're really doing is
giving you the data subject

522
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,010
some rights and privacy
against someone who

523
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,530
didn't steal your data but who let

524
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,720
somebody else steal your data.

525
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,500
And you might ask me why don't
we just go after the thief

526
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,980
and I'm going to remind
you that data thieves

527
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,730
usually don't work in
extradition jurisdictions.

528
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,130
They typically work out of the

529
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,980
non-extradition jurisdictions,
or they flee to one

530
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,512
or in some cases they are a
non-extradition jurisdiction

531
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,600
and it's hard for us to punish countries.

532
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,149
So we're left with you having
rights against a company

533
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,440
that did nothing wrong

534
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,860
except they let somebody
else steal your data.

535
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,100
And now let me see if I can
answer some of the questions

536
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,350
I promised at the beginning
of this presentation

537
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,959
to both my 1L property
students and my CEO friend

538
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,200
and you too Google.

539
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,820
When legislatures began regulating data

540
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,470
they quite unintentionally made data

541
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,930
into a new form of property.

542
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,960
We do that a lot.

543
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,810
It's easier for us to
take something unknown

544
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,120
and to put it into a familiar box.

545
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,030
And the process is familiar.

546
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,460
We've been doing that
with contracts and torts

547
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,920
and know-how and all
kinds of intangible things

548
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,120
because property is a familiar box to us.

549
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,330
Things have value, they can be transferred

550
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,540
and it's easy to have a, quote, owner.

551
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,700
But data as property is weird

552
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,610
and we have a lot of weird property

553
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,530
especially when we consider intangibles.

554
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,010
But data gets some unique
properties and people like me

555
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,010
like to write about it

556
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,920
and judges like to struggle with it a bit

557
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,430
and we're off to the races.

558
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,550
So is that the answer to the 1L question

559
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,360
because it's interesting?

560
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,830
Wait.

561
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,510
With data as property we now look at

562
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,910
and I'm not gonna point anyone out,

563
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,380
but Google and Amazon and
Microsoft and the U.S Post Office

564
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,870
and the census and my
favorite ukulele company

565
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,693
all of whom collect data and
we say, hmm is that yours?

566
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,280
And they might say, well no but look

567
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,560
it was running around the
forest and wild and free

568
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,957
so I caught it and used it
like John Locke said I should

569
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,123
and is that gonna be a problem?

570
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,453
And that could be the end of
the presentation, but it's not.

571
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,310
Several years ago I brought in

572
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,370
a university tech transfer office

573
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,020
to an entrepreneurship
class I was teaching

574
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,980
and they told the class
that all the information

575
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,370
and all the data, and quite frankly

576
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,939
all the intellectual property
belongs to the university.

577
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,360
And my students were
horrified and you know

578
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,939
our client and venters were horrified.

579
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,910
How can they claim that they cried?

580
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,140
What about the rights
of inventors and freedom

581
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,240
and privacy and all
those other good things?

582
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,293
And wait I said, and watch the magic.

583
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,990
Can the university market
the IP? Do they want to?

584
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,720
And how much is the
royalty that they want?

585
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,830
So if you have a very good
friend with a very fast car

586
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,379
and the friend hands you
the keys to the car and says

587
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,550
just be sure to bring it
back with gas in the tank

588
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,000
and, you know, maybe watch the windshield

589
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,223
are you happy that you don't own the car?

590
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,870
So as a strategy matters
we asked the question about

591
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,379
who owns your data?

592
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,660
We will still collect data
and we will still use it

593
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,010
but we ought to be concerned
with the law saying

594
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,400
that's not really your data
and the way that we encourage

595
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,850
our clients and our customers and others

596
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,040
from whom we collect that data to trust us

597
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,050
so they will continue to hand us the keys

598
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,749
to the very fast car.

599
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:54,240
Thank you very much.
