1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,580
- Hello and welcome virtually at least.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,770
My name's is Ryan Kovar.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,720
I'm here to present to you today,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,000
OODA looping in a turbulent world.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,180
I normally prefer to be there in person

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,670
and receiving your adulation on a stage

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,190
with your roses thrown at my feet,

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,012
but we'll have to do this a
little bit virtually instead.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,420
Firstly, a couple of legal statements,

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,070
my legal department prior who said

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,920
this before I speak publicly anywhere

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,100
but do not buy stock on anything I say,

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,650
nothing I'm doing here
is about expectations

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,320
and I lie often so just avoid anything.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,130
I'm doing this referring to Splunk at all

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,480
because it's just not
gonna help any of us out.

17
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:39,430
A little bit about myself before we go on.

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,420
My name is Ryan Kovar,

19
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,480
you can find me on Twitter @meanssec

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,099
which is less about my personality

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,280
and more about my belief of being average.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,888
I am a distinguished security
strategist at Splunk.

23
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,160
I've been there for about six years.

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,260
I've spoken at a whole bunch

25
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,059
of conferences around the world.

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,390
Although I have to admit not as much

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,540
in the last year as I
would have preferred.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
I've done a lot of things in my career,

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,450
a lot of public and private,

30
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,280
mostly around the ideas of nation,

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,420
state hunting and cybersecurity.

32
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,410
But for the last couple of years,

33
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,706
I have been at Splunk
and with my background

34
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:11,080
and the department of defense in the US,

35
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,390
I am a huge fan of a
concept called OODA looping

36
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,700
or the OODA loop.

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,296
To the point where a
little bit of a mockery

38
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:17,820
but one of my colleagues gave me

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,389
the title of minister of
OODA looping at Splunk.

40
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:21,899
And I do love the concept

41
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,490
and I wanna share it with you a little bit

42
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,190
about what that means to me today.

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,199
So, quick agenda

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,020
but, because legally RSA said I had

45
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,600
to have an agenda.

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,860
What is a OODA loop?

47
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,160
Why aren't we talking about attack?

48
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,149
So I'm gonna go a little bit

49
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,580
into what OODA loop is and the idea

50
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,240
of cognitive thought models.

51
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,059
I'm gonna talk about how
you take what happens

52
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,760
in an incident or in the news

53
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
and actually turn that
into a new opportunity

54
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,370
for hunting and defending.

55
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,450
We're gonna discuss how using something,

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,260
like the OODA loop actually allows you

57
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,870
to convert some of these
problems into successes

58
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,840
and then also impact your adversary,

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,510
who's tapping your network.

60
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,660
We are not gonna be flying

61
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,009
any mission accomplished banners.

62
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,600
I had enough of that with
my time in the Persian Gulf,

63
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,259
and then of course, we'll do a conclusion.

64
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,169
So your take-up homes or
stay at homes or to goes

65
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,049
I'm not really sure in this new world

66
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,160
but I want you to kind
of look at OODA loop

67
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,990
which was originally as you'll learn,

68
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,250
a fighter pilot terminology.

69
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,820
Something used by fighter pilots after

70
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,420
the Korean and Vietnam war

71
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,589
and how it applies to cybersecurity.

72
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,830
I'm gonna walk through a couple

73
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,800
of case studies of the
news of the last year.

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,500
And we're going to use that to prepare

75
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,220
for your advances tomorrow,

76
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,060
and also talk about how
to take case studies

77
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,600
in the future and apply them.

78
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,900
And finally, we're going
to discuss a concept

79
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,640
that my team has used very successfully

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,420
over multiple years which is fail less.

81
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,799
Everyday you fail, that is the reality

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,750
of being on the Blue
team is every day we fail

83
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,190
but tomorrow we try to
fail a little bit less.

84
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,850
My previous life, I worked
at DARPA for a long time

85
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,320
and they have a great mantra there

86
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,670
of 99% of DARPA projects fail

87
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,989
but when they win, it's the internet.

88
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,850
And so you have to be okay

89
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,280
with the idea of failing

90
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,750
and kind moving forward.

91
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,260
As long as you're iterating,

92
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,149
almost one might say in a loop,

93
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,130
a constant loop of success and failures.

94
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,640
So, let's get started.

95
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,339
So first, what is OODA loop?

96
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,690
Why should I care?

97
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,579
So, the concept was created first

98
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,810
by Colonel John Boyd,

99
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,610
who was a fighter pilot
in the US air force.

100
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,310
And he wrote a really
fascinating white paper,

101
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,420
many years ago in the 1960s with a great

102
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,299
what appears to be
handwritten front page here

103
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,970
about the concept of OODA loop.

104
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,600
Which stands for observe,
orient, decide and act.

105
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,079
And in the world of fighter pilots

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,730
this is where the analogy comes from.

107
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,399
In the world of fighter pilots,

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,790
it's actually about, how
they find what's going on.

109
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,459
How they figure out where they are,

110
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,560
what they do and then how they act.

111
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,110
So, if we go from the
first aspect of observed.

112
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,780
And a fighter plane you may be familiar

113
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,310
with what they look like from movies

114
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,380
or maybe you were a former
fighter pilot yourself

115
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,240
in which case, this is a
very boring talk for you.

116
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,730
But fighter planes have
a long, a long gated,

117
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,760
almost teardrop canopy with
perfectly clear, right?

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,530
'Cause, I'm almost 180 degrees

119
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,990
or 360 degree view all
the way around them.

120
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,600
So, they can see what's going on

121
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,290
and that's to allow them to observe.

122
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,870
And so fighter pilots are
constantly looking around,

123
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,180
they're observing,
they're kind of oriented,

124
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,760
kind looking around at where they are,

125
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,849
they're using radar and they're observing.

126
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,798
And when they actually
do observe a threat,

127
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,460
another fighter plane
or something going on

128
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,310
they then move into a
concept called Orient.

129
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,250
And the idea of Orient is we are used

130
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,890
to working in two dimensions, right?

131
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,599
We, we live on the ground most of us

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,010
once again, unless you're a pilot

133
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,120
and you know you can get the left,

134
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,690
you can right, you can go forward

135
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,930
and you can go back.

136
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,330
But we can't do is go up

137
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,840
and can't go down, right?

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,962
We have a X and a Y but not a Z.

139
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,060
In the concept of fighter
pilots and flying,

140
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,350
what you have to do is
understand where you are

141
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,800
and you have to Orient
yourself to the threat.

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,890
So, when you're a plane and you're flying

143
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,490
and you find out that
there's a threat from behind,

144
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,760
you have to be cognizant of where you are

145
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,170
the groundskeeper, right?

146
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,470
If there's a mountain coming up,

147
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,130
you need to know how fast you're going.

148
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,409
And are you gonna go high?

149
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,390
If you're at 30,000 feet, right?

150
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,640
So quite high, I'm not gonna

151
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,000
do the metric conversion on my, on the fly

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,570
but you're extremely high in the air.

153
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,340
You have a lot of room to go down,

154
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,563
go up, go left, go right, go over.

155
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,870
You know, if you go down, you're going

156
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,540
to pick up long speed compared to

157
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,290
if you're flying very close to the ground,

158
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,930
maybe 500 feet over.

159
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,690
You have much room to go down low

160
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,530
but you can actually use the ground swell

161
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,236
to create cover and all sorts

162
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,289
of different techniques,

163
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,890
so that kind of refers to the Orient.

164
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,390
All of those give you options

165
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,810
and when you have options you don't have

166
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,250
to decide what you're going to do.

167
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,280
So in his case maybe you're gonna perform,

168
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,169
a fighter pine maneuver
like an implement turn,

169
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,190
where you kind of go like this

170
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,270
and come back around them

171
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,620
or maybe you're gonna do a loop to loop

172
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,760
or maybe if you're a top gun fan,

173
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,890
you're gonna do an air brake

174
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,930
and slow the plane down,

175
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,780
and let them shoot past you.

176
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,900
You're kinda going through all

177
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,010
of this in your head.

178
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,659
And finally you act,

179
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,780
which is when you actually do

180
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,412
the final action of what
we're talking about.

181
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,030
Colonel Boyd figured this all out

182
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,619
by his own experiences and
interviewing other pilots.

183
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,040
And what he found was,
the successful pilots

184
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,550
in combat who'd been through, often come

185
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,210
to this sort of conclusion.

186
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,609
We're gonna have to assume

187
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,030
that the unsuccessful
pilots were not petitioned

188
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,972
for their ideas, because
they're not around to be asked.

189
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,230
But how does this apply to cybersecurity?

190
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm gonna walk you through,

191
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,080
how this can actually be adapted

192
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,870
and my high level thoughts.

193
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,520
And then we're gonna go
through some used cases.

194
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,690
So, for observed as a network defender

195
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,530
you have a lot of different options.

196
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,390
You can actually look
at telemetry coming off

197
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,150
the systems in your network.

198
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,340
Maybe it is circuit alerts,
maybe a snort alerts

199
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,049
maybe your FireEye device,

200
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,700
you know, maybe you have
similar that are kicking off

201
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,570
or maybe you do like me.

202
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,260
I'm a Twitter junkie,

203
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,150
I think a lot of people
in cybersecurity are.

204
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,659
And I'm constantly reading Twitter

205
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,200
and looking at tweets and all sorts

206
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
of things that are going on.

207
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,550
And I'm trying to get an idea

208
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,170
of what's happening in the news

209
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,240
or I don't remember the exact statistic

210
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,230
but at some point it was something like,

211
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,480
three quarters of all major breaches,

212
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,360
were actually detected by a third party

213
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,073
like the FBI and the organization was,

214
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,580
was notified.

215
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,289
And so that's the observed part, right?

216
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,260
Somebody else observed it

217
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,880
but you're getting the information.

218
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,909
So, in this case when we
talked about observed,

219
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,460
it's really observing what's happening.

220
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,570
That could be in the news

221
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,360
or that could be an actual threat

222
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,010
that's happening in your network.

223
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,040
We looked at Orient,

224
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,250
this is where you kinda have to think

225
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,560
about your exposure.

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,590
Are we affected?

227
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,810
How can we be affected?

228
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,460
What does this actually mean?

229
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,260
And also the communication.

230
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,270
So, when we talk about
this, it's kind of like,

231
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,380
I'll go into more examples,

232
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,690
as we go through the used cases,

233
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,760
but, for am I affected exposure,

234
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
you have to understand like,

235
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,390
for example, if there's a threat

236
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,740
that's happening in your office 365,

237
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,460
one of your first question should be,

238
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,930
are we actually exposed?

239
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,550
Do we have an office 365 instance?

240
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,450
Who do I need to talk to about that?

241
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,296
I need to find out, do
we have this information?

242
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,400
I need to understand what
capabilities do we have?

243
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,960
I need to communicate with my management

244
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
and understand our risk appetite.

245
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,080
Like how much are we worried

246
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,334
about defending against
this, past the impact

247
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,220
that we might have to exchange

248
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,250
or office 365 environment.

249
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,600
And that's all about understanding

250
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,963
what's going on and how?

251
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,866
The Decide is fairly easy,

252
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,310
you need to do something.

253
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,690
This might be an actual physical,

254
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,650
you know, a verb like we might be patching

255
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,359
or installing an upgrade.

256
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,059
This might be pulling the systems offline,

257
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,729
this might be putting in indicators

258
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,390
of compromise and
preparing for the future.

259
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,309
This is also going to be creating plans

260
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,869
and getting stakeholder buy-in

261
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,740
and figuring out exactly how you're going

262
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,430
to execute whatever it
is you've decided to do.

263
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,699
And the final point is
actually pretty easy

264
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,480
at least in my opinion, it's the Act.

265
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,460
Now we do it.

266
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,060
I think people are very
comfortable with the Act.

267
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,589
This is a big difference for a lot

268
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,930
of network defense teams.

269
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,439
I find personally that most

270
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,650
of the teams I talked to in the world

271
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,410
are very good at
observing and then acting.

272
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,930
But what they're not great
at doing is orienting

273
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,469
and deciding, and this is taking a break.

274
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,660
This is stopping.

275
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,370
This is, the concept is to go fast.

276
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,930
First, you have to go slow.

277
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,170
You're doing a preparation

278
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,660
and at first this is hard

279
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,430
for teams to do because
there's an active threat.

280
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,290
Eventually with any luck
you're gonna get to a position

281
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,550
or a posture where you're being pro active

282
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,300
with OODA loop to the point where,

283
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,420
you're not so worried about
jumping straight to Act

284
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,150
because you've been
predicting what's happened

285
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,470
or you've practiced it so much.

286
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,810
That you can just kinda go
through this very quickly.

287
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,150
But at first, it's a little painful

288
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,360
for people to actually stop and think

289
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,690
and determine, and decide and act.

290
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,940
But we'll kind of go
into that in the future.

291
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,930
For those of you who are Top Gun fans

292
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,400
this is perhaps not so much

293
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,689
of a Maverick term, but a nice man.

294
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,840
If you've watched a movie Maverick

295
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,410
is actually a horrible pilot.

296
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,439
He's never, anyone I'd
wanna have under my command.

297
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,950
He's kind of a rockstar,

298
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,480
he doesn't do anything by the book

299
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
which is not exactly what you want.

300
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,730
According to my former
time in the US Navy.

301
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,650
What you want is probably
more like a nice man,

302
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,540
someone who's thinking
and being methodical

303
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,930
and going through all the ideas.

304
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,719
Maverick would probably go straight to Act

305
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,560
and, you know buzz the
tower and kills crewman.

306
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,469
So, don't be a don't be a Maverick

307
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,740
when you're doing this in response.

308
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,400
So, how do we convert the bad news

309
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,693
into new opportunities?

310
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,010
So, some of you may have heard,

311
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,040
there's a little virus
in the last year COVID

312
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,400
or coronavirus depending on your timeframe

313
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,709
of remembering this.

314
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,730
It was pretty horrible,

315
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,130
it affected the whole world.

316
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,780
Obviously it's been, horribly impacting

317
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,740
to every one of the 7 billion people

318
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,160
on this planet, rotating the sun.

319
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,020
Everyone has dealt with
this from a personal level

320
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,590
but we've also dealt with
this on a professional level.

321
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,350
In the world of cybersecurity,

322
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,280
COVID has actually had a major impact.

323
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,530
I could talk a lot today

324
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,199
about how we've all gone
to remote work from home,

325
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,310
how we're attending
conferences virtual instead

326
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,510
of all meeting together in San Francisco

327
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,140
or in, in Las Vegas.

328
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,610
But the reality is this
has been a major effect

329
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,940
in your organization.

330
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,773
If you're watching this

331
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:05,730
and you're in cybersecurity

332
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,180
you have an impact on coronavirus.

333
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,170
So, let's take a moment here,

334
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,829
we're gonna walk through
this as a case study.

335
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,280
Let's first look and observe.

336
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,410
A lot of people didn't know how

337
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,719
this was gonna impact them at first.

338
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,553
But if you look at some

339
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:18,290
of the news sites over last year

340
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,890
and some of these are very, very recent

341
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,040
from, you know the 31st of,

342
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,910
sorry the 1st of March, this year 2021.

343
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,819
You can see that, the cyber criminals

344
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,030
and adversaries and
nation state adversaries

345
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,030
of the world immediately
started using COVID nefariously.

346
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,610
And by that, I mean they
did things like create,

347
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,170
here we have from the
last regrade or general.

348
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,209
People were creating fake
COVID vaccine websites.

349
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,820
So, they were creating
websites that purported

350
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,336
to have vaccines that are actually pushing

351
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:50,343
out malicious software.

352
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,170
Things that I remember very strongly

353
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,610
from the very beginning of COVID

354
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,600
and the second article here is from,

355
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,010
you know ZDNet from March 18th, 2020.

356
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,913
So almost exactly a year ago,

357
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,709
that was thousands of
domains were being created

358
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,703
that had the word COVID or
coronavirus inside of it.

359
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,280
And just as a side, if we look over here

360
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,439
at Info-security 70% of
aurochs had challenges

361
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,910
from COVID pandemic.

362
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,209
As I said earlier some us
could not work from home,

363
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,530
some of us knew VPN,

364
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,230
some of us dealing with zoom,

365
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,650
but a whole bunch of this
is just people have issues

366
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,150
with clicking through, on
things have to do with COVID.

367
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,380
So, for this case study,
we're gonna mostly focus

368
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,950
on that the idea of malicious domains

369
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,940
and IP addresses, that
are related to COVID.

370
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,680
If I look through, and
this is a good point

371
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,939
you're gonna to see some
Splunk screenshots here.

372
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,030
I work at Splunk, they
pay for all my clothing,

373
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,829
pretty much at this point in my life,

374
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,670
nothing I'm talking
about today has anything

375
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,000
to do with Splunk other
than I'm using it to paint

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,630
the picture of what we're talking about.

377
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,400
So, you can do this
whatever tool you want.

378
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,290
I'm just using Splunk

379
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,510
'cause I have a free license.

380
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,210
So, with that in mind,
here we have an example

381
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,390
where I went through and did a whole bunch

382
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,900
of research on COVID earlier last year

383
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,030
in March and April.

384
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,709
And it did a whole bunch of vlog posts

385
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,130
and to do so I set up
a lab and I was looking

386
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,050
at malicious things as they came through,

387
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,750
I actually pulled that DNS record.

388
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,820
And you can see, for example,

389
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,450
here, I'm looking at DNS off my home lab.

390
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,970
I just put in COVID or Corona,

391
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,400
It's kinda hard to remember this point

392
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,870
but we used to call this Corona virus

393
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,720
a lot more than COVID and very quickly,

394
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,890
I see a whole bunch of domains here

395
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,600
that come up with the
word Corona or COVID.

396
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,380
I happen to know each one of
these is actually malicious.

397
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,560
And at one time was pushing out malware.

398
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,949
I'm using this as an example

399
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,800
of observing in your own network.

400
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,699
I'm observing that this is occurring,

401
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm looking I'm, I'm seeing what's there.

402
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,540
That starts to blend a little bit Orient.

403
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,560
But right now it's just you can imagine

404
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,099
this being just like.

405
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,970
Hey, I've heard about this COVID thing,

406
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,600
does this even exist in
my network, should I care?

407
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,450
In this case the answer would be yes.

408
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,579
Other aspects of Orient.

409
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,840
Like we looked at the new sites

410
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,367
but you're gonna wanna reach out to vlogs.

411
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,252
You're gonna little look at things.

412
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,910
You're gonna look at
peers in the industry.

413
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,829
Once again, I wrote or helped edit most

414
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,840
of these vlog posts here.

415
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,630
So, I'm using them as examples

416
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,889
but the vendor world
especially when crazy talking

417
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,593
about how to help and protect
yourself against a threat.

418
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,569
What other aspect for Orient for COVID-19?

419
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,480
I re immediately remember thinking like.

420
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,750
Oh, man what about email?

421
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,300
So, a big part of what happens

422
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,670
when adversaries actually
have something as big news,

423
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,770
as COVID it's they use that in lures.

424
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,329
And what I mean by
lures for spear fishing,

425
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,070
Dave Harold and I, co-workers Splunk,

426
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,130
came and talked to years
ago at Sam CPI Summit called

427
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,120
The Threat Intelligence Victory Garden.

428
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,780
And we talked about how you
could actually take APIs

429
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,900
from economist or New York times

430
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,990
and look through them
for interesting words

431
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,430
and then actually find
them in email subjects.

432
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,489
This is an example where
I kinda showed some

433
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,030
of that here of, if I
wanted to look for a domain

434
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,300
or a name of someone
emailing in with basically

435
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,260
the word COVID or coronavirus,

436
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,720
it might be a good idea.

437
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,790
Other aspects here,

438
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,780
I'm showing a digital footprint summary

439
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,923
of a network that I helped work on.

440
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
That's the idea that
you need to understand

441
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
what your ground space is
for your own organization.

442
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,210
So, for I'm talking here,

443
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,980
most of the companies in the world

444
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,490
are not producing vaccines

445
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,550
or they're not healthcare companies.

446
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,750
If you're a healthcare company

447
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,230
if you're developing vaccines,

448
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,900
if you're in chemicals

449
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,620
you may actually have a significant amount

450
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,770
of websites that actually
have the word COVID

451
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,970
that are both legitimate

452
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,330
for your users to reach
out to and look to.

453
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,163
But they're also something

454
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:37,030
that your own domain might
have and host, right?

455
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,780
If you work for a pharmaceutical
acne pharmaceutical

456
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,050
you might very well have
COVID-19 vaccine.Acne

457
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,790
pharmaceutical.com or
COVID location.pharmacy.com

458
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,920
something like that.

459
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,780
So, the Orient phase you also need

460
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,439
to understand your own
exposure both from a positive

461
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,250
but also in a negative point of view.

462
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,380
And this is a good time
to gather all that data.

463
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,290
In the academic world,

464
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,150
I'd probably call this kind

465
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,329
of a literature would
review about the threat.

466
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,950
And we're looking at a
variety of different sources.

467
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,260
As you can tell I actually tend

468
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,817
to spend most of my time in the Orient

469
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,500
because it allows me to
get much better information

470
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,763
about where we go next.

471
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,410
Finally, if you are talking about domains,

472
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,319
which we've been kinda using as the stick,

473
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
we're gonna beat this
dead horse with you here.

474
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,670
I always like to use
something like domain tools

475
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,219
or risk IQ or a whole bunch

476
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,420
of other folks to do this.

477
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,939
I'm very familiar with domain tools

478
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
that's why I'm talking about them here.

479
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,210
But this is a perfect example

480
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,880
where that word COVID, we know that's bad.

481
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,439
I've put this into this domain tools,

482
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,840
tool actually just look at all the domains

483
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,924
that have the word COVID into,

484
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:42,720
and you can see they found
726 records about COVID.

485
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
Now the nice thing about this tool

486
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,550
is it actually also finds

487
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,959
and pivots on infrastructure

488
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,310
that's known that, so
it's not only finding

489
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,930
the word COVID but it's finding things

490
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,550
that have to do with COVID

491
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,050
that has shared infrastructure

492
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,469
and all sorts of things like this.

493
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,430
A lot of other tools do
this, I just happened

494
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,780
to use two main tools because I like it.

495
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,839
But this is a good area of Orient as well.

496
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,290
Just seeing all the
different places that you

497
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,859
might be affected or targeted by

498
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,469
and creating that list of things you need

499
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,450
to be aware of.

500
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,760
As we can see here, one,
two, three, COVID clean.com.

501
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,060
Although I do enjoy that domain probably

502
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,772
has not very much to do with
helping people be clean.

503
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,919
Decide, when you have to decide what to do

504
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,391
that's where you're gonna
start communicating.

505
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:26,770
You're gonna start figuring out

506
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,100
what your outcomes are of that research

507
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,459
of that Orient, right?

508
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,020
Now that you've figured out all the things

509
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,853
that could impact you.

510
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:34,630
You need to figure out what to do with it.

511
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,496
A lot of this is around external education

512
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,717
or determining what's available.

513
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,390
What is the risk appetite
of your own company?

514
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,960
For example, in this case,

515
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,270
I'm showing working through our IOC idea.

516
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,820
Cyber crime support.org

517
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,320
actually I believe hosts submissive server

518
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,649
with a very complicated.edu domain here

519
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,470
and that MIS server if you're unfamiliar

520
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,160
with MIS it's a way to, it's a

521
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,240
it's a open source threat
intelligence platform

522
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,380
that's heavily used in Europe.

523
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,460
And they're actually hosting indicators

524
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,270
of compromise as were found by COVID.

525
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,800
For those of you who follow the news

526
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,419
or also a whole bunch of Slack groups,

527
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,740
there's a Cyber Coconut Alliance

528
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,573
or something like that,

529
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:14,040
just a lot of different options.

530
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,030
And that may very well be how you decide

531
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,680
to deal with this initial
threat of IOCs, right?

532
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,790
You're gonna find people
who found bad indicators

533
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,290
of compromise around the idea
of COVID and coronavirus.

534
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,850
You're gonna put that into a threat list

535
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,480
and whatever tooling you have.

536
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,190
Example, I'm giving here
is obviously a Splunk one,

537
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,950
like we talked about,
you're gonna do something

538
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,300
but a significant portion

539
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,180
of Decide is also communicating.

540
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,590
This is also where you're doing something

541
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,810
I've always called murder board.

542
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,129
I'm sure there's a better term for it

543
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,770
but you're talking to your peers

544
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,470
and making sure to be
solution you're decided on

545
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,680
is the strongest.

546
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,780
So for example, it's
great that you've come up

547
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,070
with the way the detect an alert

548
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,649
and maybe even block on
indicators are compromised.

549
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,430
But as David Bianco says, you know,

550
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,550
in the pyramid of pain

551
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,523
and I now owe him a $100 extra.

552
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,129
Domains, IP addresses, and
hashes cryptographic hazards

553
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,760
of files are the easiest things to move

554
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,590
and manipulate by adversaries.

555
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,580
So if you're not also
educating your user base

556
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,750
you're failing because
you haven't actually

557
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,940
gone all the way through, right?

558
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,700
People are always gonna click on links.

559
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,320
You're never gonna be able
to create and click enough.

560
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,070
The final aspect of this is when

561
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,270
this is when you're going to be talking

562
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,230
to your leadership about
what you've decided to do,

563
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,090
after you've oriented to yourself.

564
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,510
So, if you're gonna
actually put in these blocks

565
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,430
for covid.com or COVID websites,

566
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,290
maybe you're gonna be
very aggressive on this

567
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,370
or you want to be, you're gonna find out

568
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,520
that perhaps your leadership, your CIS,

569
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,450
or your CIO or your
CEO, actually wants you

570
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,880
to be less aggressive,
because there a risk appetite

571
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
for their business is
lower than what you think

572
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,390
the risk appetite should be.

573
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,750
So, this is where the
decided aspect comes in.

574
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,300
And then you have to figure out what to do

575
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,240
once you've decided what to do,

576
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
I actually think this part's the easiest,

577
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,980
you're gonna act, right?

578
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,240
You're gonna do the verb.

579
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,210
Now, the reality is the act phase may be

580
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,850
the longest thing you do, right?

581
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,929
It could be weeks of
building out a new solution.

582
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,020
It could be days of implementing some

583
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,824
for a different path

584
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:10,370
but if you haven't done
the Orient, Observe,

585
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,030
Observe, Orient and decide

586
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,040
beforehand, you don't necessarily know

587
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,300
if you're making the best
decision for the Act.

588
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,669
But like I said, in our world

589
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,600
it's my belief that people
tend to go immediately

590
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,850
to Act, because it's very comforting.

591
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,683
It's hard to think,

592
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,830
It's hard to do critical analysis,

593
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,720
It's hard to work through
cognitive thought models

594
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,320
but it's very easy just
to pull the trigger

595
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,860
and start doing something.

596
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,010
But if you take a step
back and you remember

597
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,680
the philosophy of to go fast,

598
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,850
sometimes you should go slow.

599
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,260
Hopefully you'll have a more measured

600
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,140
and informed response
and have all the answers

601
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,500
that you need for your business

602
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
and to protect yourselves.

603
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,730
Let's do a another use
case here, supply chain.

604
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,090
So this is very popular supply chain

605
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,340
of course, in this case, I'm
referring to solar winds.

606
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,439
The solar winds attack, hopefully everyone

607
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,430
in this meeting at this point knows this,

608
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,010
on this conference talk
knows about solar winds

609
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,180
but if you're not familiar with it,

610
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,730
the very very high level

611
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,550
is that a third-party vendor.

612
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,790
And I have no, no blame at all to them.

613
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not going to anything around

614
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,400
the SolarWinds Company in any way.

615
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
But the point is this idea

616
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,750
of supply chain is that a, a vendor

617
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,320
that was trusted by
organizations around the world

618
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,310
had their software development
supply chain compromise.

619
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,629
And that compromise led
to malicious software,

620
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,527
being passed through a point of trust

621
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:30,630
to thousands, tens of thousands

622
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,990
of their customer base and hundreds

623
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,250
of them were affected.

624
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,530
And this is a very,
very difficult problem.

625
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,120
If anyone has said they've,

626
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,530
if they've solved supply chain

627
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,729
then they should probably
be keynoting RSA in 2022

628
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:43,950
'cause I certainly haven't heard it.

629
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,960
It's a very hard problem

630
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,230
for vendors and customers to deal with.

631
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,748
As such, it's a perfect thing

632
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:52,250
for a team to actually
look at and working, right?

633
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,070
To actually practice and to apply

634
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,480
this concept of OODA loop to.

635
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,890
So, let's do that once again observed,

636
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,000
I should have done some
vlogs here that I've ring,

637
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,140
you may be like may a news junkie

638
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,083
and my Slack started to
kick up on Sunday, right?

639
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,010
I think it was Sunday, December 10th

640
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,930
or something like that or 16,

641
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,330
something along those lines.

642
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,340
So, we'll say December 16th I think.

643
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,929
Where basically someone said.

644
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,960
Oh, man FireEye's gonna
release a big blog soon.

645
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,920
Oh, it might impact, you know,

646
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,300
Microsoft might be impacted.

647
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,770
I think it's about SolarWinds.

648
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,720
And then suddenly, you
know, this is a system

649
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,350
of which is a part of DHS release.

650
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,209
This really big deal, this alert

651
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,043
where they actually talked

652
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:34,260
about an apt threat to SolarWinds, right?

653
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,440
This is part of that observed.

654
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
It's really interesting

655
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,500
I think it's key here to understand

656
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,050
that 99.99% of organizations around

657
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,950
the world had not detected this

658
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,950
for months or over a year.

659
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,103
If I remember correctly,
don't hold me to it

660
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,090
I don't have the figure in front of me.

661
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,720
I think it was actually the first activity

662
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,140
was something like September, 2019.

663
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,540
So, this had gone on for years

664
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,983
before we detected it or
a year and a half plus.

665
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,410
And it's difficult for us to say,

666
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,930
oh we should have seen
this from our tools.

667
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,510
Obviously we didn't.

668
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,870
There was some evidence, for example,

669
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,909
there's a great IRR from volatility,

670
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,370
who actually had written a vlog post

671
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,760
in August of 2020 where they detected,

672
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,456
some interesting DGA that ended up related

673
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,909
to this larger SolarWinds campaign.

674
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,800
But they just didn't
pull the thread enough,

675
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,659
point is once you hear about it,

676
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,930
you have to go do your work.

677
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,320
You need to figure out what's happening.

678
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,153
And that's where you're gonna learn

679
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,620
about supply chains and dependencies.

680
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,659
There was also another piece

681
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,370
of news release a couple
of weeks ago or a month ago

682
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,179
about how somebody a researcher actually,

683
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,520
basically put a canary
into some dependencies

684
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,600
and JavaScript and Python, I believe.

685
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,060
And then they found out later on

686
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,800
that some major, major vendors,

687
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,250
were actually slipping up
there's library dependencies

688
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,040
in their Python and JavaScript
without reviewing them.

689
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,720
And that's actually also a supply chain

690
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,540
a software supply chain in
this case, it's dependencies.

691
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,940
So there's a lot of different areas here

692
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,020
that you can use to observe and find out.

693
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,670
But once you started doing
that research, right?

694
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,660
You're also gonna look internally.

695
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,640
So, here's an example
of, after you found out

696
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,610
that news you need to
observe what's happening

697
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,070
in your own business.

698
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,270
In this case, I've
downloaded all the indicators

699
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,580
of compromise that were released

700
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,500
by Microsoft, FireEye and Cisco.

701
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,430
I put them into a couple
couplets basically in Splunk.

702
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,480
And then I looked at my domains.

703
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,420
In this case, I had actually done a WDA

704
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,470
and I just wanted to prove
that my methodology worked

705
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,800
the vlog posts I wrote.

706
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,710
But imagine if you ran
this and you did see

707
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,740
that you had a beacon out from one

708
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,650
of your internal hosts
in depthsecurity.com.

709
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,440
That's gonna change how
you orient yourself later.

710
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,010
But now from a scientific
method point of view

711
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,460
we're just saying, we've
observed this happening.

712
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,550
Once you start orienting yourself,

713
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,639
you're gonna figure out a
couple of different things.

714
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,040
One, your orientation might be different

715
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,909
if you had network traffic going

716
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,420
to these IFCs or not.

717
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,550
I'm gonna assume that we didn't

718
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,930
in this case and you're gonna reach out

719
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,370
and you're gonna find more information

720
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,379
about specifically what
you're interested in.

721
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,700
You're gonna see what
your susceptibility is.

722
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,750
Maybe you're gonna
extrapolate a little bit,

723
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,250
maybe you're doing this
months afterward SolarWinds

724
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,280
like we are now.

725
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,320
And you're saying, hey, we
are dealt with SolarWinds

726
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
but we're doing this as a war game effort.

727
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,220
And you're gonna say,
who else do we depend on

728
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,930
for this sort of dependency attack,

729
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,890
or where are we susceptible?

730
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,310
If we look here, I've listed out,

731
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,020
you know the top 25 software companies,

732
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,330
Splunk included on this.

733
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,300
Like everyone is susceptible

734
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,840
to this in one way or the other.

735
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,300
And you're gonna wanna to figure out how

736
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,940
to actually deal with that, right?

737
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,037
And you need to see where
you're impacted or not.

738
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,513
And this is all about that Orient aspect.

739
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,670
Another part you're gonna do

740
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,750
is your gonna look for
deep dives from people.

741
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,980
Joe is a great researcher at domain tools.

742
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,200
He does a lot of tweets.

743
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,350
I don't think he sleeps at all.

744
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,360
He also writes really long
informed blog proves pieces

745
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,199
as the perfect example where
you're gonna go through

746
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,580
and just get more and more information

747
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,649
and build up your own story and narrative.

748
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,380
I also believe this is super important

749
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,060
for cybersecurity professionals

750
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,629
because you need to be confident

751
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,770
in what you're talking about

752
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,070
for when your leadership
asks you questions.

753
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,580
In a former life I used
to have what I call

754
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,730
the Fox news test where I didn't have

755
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,430
to worry about explaining something

756
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,350
to my leadership until
it made morning news

757
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,490
on Fox news, something similar here.

758
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,810
Going through folks like this

759
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,070
who are deep dive experts.

760
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,860
I'm certainly not in this area,

761
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,080
what's really useful for me

762
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
to be able to provide answers.

763
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,080
And then eventually I did
become a deep dive expert

764
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,090
on how to help people with SolarWinds,

765
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,683
all part of the Orient aspect.

766
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,389
When you start thinking
to deciding what to do

767
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,100
for something like the supply chain attack

768
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,449
you need to think in a variety of places.

769
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,640
If I was an organization, what I would do

770
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,750
and I'm very lucky that I work at Splunk.

771
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,330
So, I don't have to stay up in the middle

772
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,629
of night thinking about this,

773
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,810
but I may asking do I have the telemetry

774
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,179
to detect something like

775
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,217
the SolarWind supply
chain tack in the future?

776
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:46,300
I might wanna use an open
source software like Zeek,

777
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,419
which would actually allow me

778
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,040
to have DNS records to find things.

779
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,688
DNS like we talked about
that company volatility

780
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,950
they actually found examples

781
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,590
of DGA domain generated algorithm traffic,

782
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,580
related to solar winds
a month ahead of time.

783
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,800
They just didn't peel the,

784
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,240
you know peel the onion back far enough.

785
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,510
No, nothing against them.

786
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,800
No one would have ever expected.

787
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,159
This is a noble threat,

788
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,870
but could you have detected it?

789
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,250
Can you look back through your logs

790
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,510
and say, yeah, we have this.

791
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,330
And not only that, I have the ability

792
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,770
to pull DNS back for two years

793
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,570
that it would have been
required to determine

794
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,500
if we were attacked by this, right?

795
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,810
This is where you're kinda deciding

796
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,643
what you're doing.

797
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,060
It's a little bit of blending others

798
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,250
from overlap here with Orient,

799
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,150
but allows you to think through,

800
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,260
deciding tools like attack, right?

801
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,100
Another cognitive thought model here,

802
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,010
you can look through this

803
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,890
and maybe you've, you've made your matrix

804
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,620
and you've filled in all the squares

805
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,199
that have to do with supply chain

806
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,770
on the Mitre Attack matrix.

807
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,500
Are you able to defend
or do you have detections

808
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,450
or mitigations or things
like that for each one

809
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,920
of those matrices?

810
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,690
And then on the other side of this

811
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,240
how are you gonna deal with those vendors

812
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,715
that we talked about earlier?

813
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:53,840
One of the big changes,

814
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,860
I've seen since SolarWind as a vendor

815
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,080
is that, customers are
asking a lot bigger questions

816
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,770
for what am I asking much deeper questions

817
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,920
about our supply chain.

818
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,810
And I'm not the only one,

819
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,230
I can tell you any software vendor

820
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,660
in the world is dealing with this.

821
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,520
And you should be,
customers should be asking

822
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,800
their vendors, these sort of questions

823
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,960
and hopefully they have
good answers for you.

824
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,900
But have you come up with
that new question here?

825
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,550
Have you looked through that, right?

826
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,980
Are you gonna do that in the future?

827
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,970
What's your, what do you do if,

828
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,690
you know, what if you go
to your software vendor

829
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,320
and they say, yeah we
don't have any protection?

830
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,840
Do you have an outcome of that?

831
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,439
This is all part of that Decide.

832
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,889
You may also have to deal

833
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,100
with external forces that are compliance.

834
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,270
If you are a US government customer

835
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,110
for example your Decide,

836
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,330
may be very tied to your app

837
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,350
because US government basically told,

838
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,780
every civilian agency in the entire world

839
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,610
or US civilian agency in the world

840
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,110
to uninstall and remove
from the wind, SolarWinds

841
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,040
or remove the network
that SolarWind device.

842
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,149
This is gonna be massively different.

843
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,940
This can also be thrown in Orient

844
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,310
and it's gonna really
change what you decide

845
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,810
to do on the other side.

846
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,423
So to me, this is another
aspect of that decide.

847
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,220
Finally, Act once again,

848
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,240
once you've figured out
what you're gonna do,

849
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,210
as I said, this is a the least amount

850
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,930
to say about this because
it's just the noun

851
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,190
of doing but once you actually have this,

852
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,073
you're gonna do it.

853
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,900
What I haven't talked about yet,

854
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,010
is a constant iterative process.

855
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,379
That's why it's a loop.

856
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,520
So, once you've actually begin

857
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,540
to deciding what to do and you act,

858
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,700
you're then gonna turn around
and look all over again.

859
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,940
And personally, what I would do

860
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,100
is come to a consistent looping

861
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,760
of this OODA loop of what did we do?

862
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,593
How do we do it?

863
00:29:32,593 --> 00:29:33,870
And is this the right choice?

864
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,570
And you're kinda looking through

865
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,403
and applying this.

866
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:39,240
I've used case studies of
actual real-world events

867
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,090
of what's happened, but I haven't gone

868
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,110
all the way through them.

869
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,260
Like I normally would in a
real incident or activity.

870
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,110
So take that as well, those
are places you wanna improve.

871
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,440
So, this is now my favorite slide

872
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,273
in the whole deck.

873
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,040
Air braking your adversary.

874
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,960
What is the whole point of this?

875
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,770
And I come off as a really
big top gun movie fan here.

876
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,150
I'm not actually a huge soccer,

877
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,150
and movie fans perfectly fine

878
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,590
but fanatically this
whole worked out well.

879
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,860
Air braking your adversaries.

880
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,590
What we do in cyber defense.

881
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,240
I talked earlier about this concept,

882
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,963
of fail less or fail a
little bit less every day.

883
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,813
We have never categorically
beaten adversaries

884
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,300
against our networks.

885
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,010
We work hard to make sure
that what we're doing

886
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,140
is going to work, but
at the end of the day,

887
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,820
it does come back.

888
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,580
The adversaries come back, they do things.

889
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,929
So how do we get past them?

890
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,990
Part of what you're doing

891
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,650
in life here is just increasing

892
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,483
the time of your adversary.

893
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,350
They're gonna have to go.

894
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,949
They're gonna have to do things

895
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,730
it's taking longer and longer

896
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,550
for them to actually build
out new infrastructure.

897
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,560
If you've looked at the
Mandiant stat the dwell time

898
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,929
is actually reduced
significantly on networks.

899
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,530
So they've had to go back
in, come up with new ways.

900
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,240
Every time we get better and think harder

901
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,050
about coming up with these outcomes,

902
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,389
adversaries have to increase

903
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,650
the amount of time they do

904
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,190
for new and novel attacks.

905
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,640
SolarWinds was not easy
to do on the forefront,

906
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,350
although it did make
them much more efficient

907
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,459
to attack many, many organizations.

908
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,060
There's a lot of work to get in there.

909
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,020
And now that's gone,

910
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,710
the entire method is now

911
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,310
this is the idea of
burning down infrastructure

912
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,210
by sharing indicators of compromise

913
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,000
by sharing attack TTPs,

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,110
all sorts of things like this.

915
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,199
Adversaries have to come up

916
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,700
with new novel ways of attacking.

917
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,030
The reason that, that adversary created

918
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,889
that methodology into solar winds

919
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,210
is because the easier routes

920
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,100
that they've used past, in my opinion,

921
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,263
probably weren't as
successful as they used to be.

922
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,220
So, they had to come up
with something much harder

923
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,520
and much more interesting.

924
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,389
This is what we're trying
to do is blue teamers.

925
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,060
Final part to pull from
one of my favorite books

926
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,360
in the world, Hitchhiker's
guide to the galaxy,

927
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,050
don't panic when you have a plan.

928
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,350
I know it's very tempting

929
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,990
to some immediately pivot into acting.

930
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,119
But if you actually take a step back,

931
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,820
think about what you're doing,

932
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,429
think about why you're doing it.

933
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,440
Look at your entire profile,
look at your exposure.

934
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,100
Think about your risk appetite.

935
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,179
You make much better
decisions when you do execute

936
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,120
and you can have a path
forward after there.

937
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,010
So conclusion, don't think of OODA looping

938
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,050
as just a us military or
fighter pilot terminology.

939
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,139
It has a lot of applicability
for your day job.

940
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,060
Hopefully I've been able

941
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,560
to explain this fairly well to you.

942
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,580
I use it all the time at work to this day.

943
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,159
I think it's a great way to
think through problem sets.

944
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,270
It's also very easy for
you to involve group

945
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,370
in some sort of round
table in a previous life,

946
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,840
in a previous before times,

947
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,280
I used to sit down in a conference room.

948
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,250
We would do this over coffee.

949
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,950
Now, obviously we're doing a virtual

950
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,630
but you can do this at home.

951
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,463
It's very easy.

952
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:41,830
It's absolutely free.

953
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,810
And it just helps you organize

954
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,023
and think through things more effectively.

955
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,920
I find case studies of
previous events critical

956
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,310
to helping me build my
defenses in the future.

957
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,629
Take advantage of other people's successes

958
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,970
and failures read through them

959
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,050
apply them to your world and think

960
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,797
through them using something like

961
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,340
the Lockheed Martin kill chain

962
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,790
or think through your OODA looping,

963
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,747
thinking is free.

964
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:05,580
That's one of the few things

965
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,600
we get to do in cybersecurity

966
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,726
that doesn't cost any money,

967
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:09,150
take advantage of the work

968
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,500
that other people have done in written

969
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,650
to actually go through.

970
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,240
I love thought models.

971
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,230
That's probably coming through
quite a bit in this talk.

972
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,000
You know, I was once again part

973
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,730
of the United States department of defense

974
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,780
the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain

975
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,450
has been partly ruined by marketing.

976
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,390
But if you actually read the white paper

977
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,820
that they wrote almost 10
years ago to this month,

978
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,429
I believe, I think it was
last month was 10 years ago.

979
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,650
It's an incredible piece of work.

980
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,540
It really goes through how a brick

981
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,690
and mortar defense industrial base,

982
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,180
global corporation defends
against nation state adversaries.

983
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,890
The key here is don't
use it for everything.

984
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,930
Lockheed Martin cyber
kill chain was designed

985
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,483
for a defense industrial base organization

986
00:33:49,483 --> 00:33:51,010
that has a significant amount

987
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,900
of brick and mortar
buildings and employees.

988
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,270
So it was not necessarily designed

989
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,170
for Silicon Valley 20%
startup with all cloud assets.

990
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,950
So use it, but don't, don't,
don't be slavish to it.

991
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,450
Mitre Attack same sort of
things actually developed

992
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,949
for people to major threat
intelligence analysts

993
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,949
to better group the
activities of threat actors.

994
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,040
We in the security operations center world

995
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,020
network vendors love it,
because we can apply it

996
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,540
to so many different things,

997
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,710
but understand the context

998
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,320
of how that thought model was created

999
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
and how it can apply to you.

1000
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,670
Katie Nichols and I formerly a Mitre

1001
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,050
she's now at Red Canary gave a talk

1002
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,699
at Black Hat two years ago,

1003
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,533
where we talked about all the ways

1004
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,759
that people go wrong with Mitre Attack.

1005
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,370
So if you're interested
take a look at that talk,

1006
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,859
it might help you out.

1007
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,600
Finally, OODA loop I absolutely love it,

1008
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,659
but it has very specific applications.

1009
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,710
So, use a combination of these,

1010
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,810
go through them once again, it's all free.

1011
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,460
So it's helping you think better.

1012
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm a huge fan of 30, 60, 90 days

1013
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,080
in this case I was obligated

1014
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,790
to do next week, three
months and six months.

1015
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,580
But the idea is the same.

1016
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,480
Think about how you can
actually use OODA loop

1017
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,990
in your incident responses immediately.

1018
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,399
Hopefully you've started
thinking about that today.

1019
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,490
After this start applying it to more

1020
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,089
than just your immediate break fix IRR.

1021
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,730
How do you look at the news, right?

1022
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,180
Maybe you're using this to
create hunting hypothesis,

1023
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,549
maybe the outcome of
your hunting hypothesis

1024
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,220
which is your, you know,
observe is then you go

1025
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,899
into the Orient, Decide and Act,

1026
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,760
based on the outcomes of
your hunting hypothesis

1027
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,670
after six months what I
really hope you're able

1028
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,600
to do, is go back and review
the success or failure

1029
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,779
of these OODA loop incidents, right?

1030
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,650
Actually document the outcomes of these

1031
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,310
and go through and try
to internally improve

1032
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,560
which goes back to the final theme.

1033
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,730
Hopefully you no longer think is negative,

1034
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,563
which has failed less.

1035
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:41,270
Every day you fail, but tomorrow try

1036
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,759
to fail a little bit less.

1037
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,970
That's what I do in life.

1038
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,549
And that's what I hopefully
did for this talk.

1039
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,640
So that information,
my name is Ryan Kovar.

1040
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
I work at Splunk and you can find me

1041
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,560
on Twitter @meansec.

1042
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Thank you very much.
