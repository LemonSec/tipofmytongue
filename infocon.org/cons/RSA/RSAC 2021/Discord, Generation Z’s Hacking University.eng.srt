1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,520
- Hi, my name is Brook Chelmo.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,510
I am a Senior Strategist
working on our product team here

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,359
at SonicWall.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,557
And I'm here to speak with you about,

5
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:11,320
"Discord, Generation
Z's Hacking University"

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,270
and as also some may
call, the potential future

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,919
of the dark net. (sniffles)

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,620
So this presentation isn't
exactly about stopping attacks

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,490
from Discord but on how Generation
Z is forming and molding

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,669
into our future defenders and attackers

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,960
with Discord as a proof point.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,530
And how they are
connecting, coding, working

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,010
and preparing for the future. (sniffles)

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,599
And I will prove that
hacking on Discord is growing

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,650
and provide tips on deflecting
attacks from this platform.

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,030
And talk and how we can solve
the need for people to attack

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,810
based on, or through employment.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,760
So my whole journey with
this story started with me

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,400
on a Saturday night, finding
that one of the tweets

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,769
about a hacking crew that I put out there

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,550
was retweeted by the
actual crew I was you know,

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,720
talking about.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,320
And this was HILDACRYPT.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,269
And it was a Russian ransomware crew.

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,460
I can't get into the
details on the specifics

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,250
because of our agreement
together. (sniffles)

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,243
But essentially,

28
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,910
I asked to interview them
and get to know them.

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,990
And it took me over two
weeks to really write

30
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,850
the first story and really
start talking about this

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,339
because I had to reboot
my entire understanding

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,270
of how they work and how their
motivations operated their,

33
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,300
their methodology, because
it was a different generation

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,946
of attackers than I was
used to dealing with.

35
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,960
(sniffles) So with that being
said, they introduced me

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,820
to a whole new world of
different people who were working

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,630
on the Discord platform,

38
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,009
a lot of them Generation Z attackers.

39
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,140
I was introduced and didn't
get a chance to talk to

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,590
a Latvian crew that focused
on email tent infections

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,960
for South American banks.

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,539
But in the time I was able to
speak with anonymous attackers

43
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,830
as well as defenders.

44
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,830
So the story also can be very
good and wholesome as well.

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,620
So the question for a lot of
people is what is Discord?

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,919
Discord is a gaming chat channel

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,500
which has a wonderful
scripting engine built into it

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,880
which is designed to help
moderators make life easier.

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,430
You can use it to scrub out
foul language or you know,

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,760
pull people out of the chat

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,370
or redirect them to certain ways.

52
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,320
You can redirect people into
different channels based on

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,799
some of the things that they're doing.

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,540
So the scripting engine behind
Discord provides now also

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,540
attackers and defenders
powerful tools for hacking both

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,540
on the blue team and the red team side

57
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,380
or the black hat, white hat,
apologies for the colors

58
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,602
on this equation.

59
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,950
So that being said, what
is on Discord is that

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,609
one of course, I'm here to
also be a fan of Discord

61
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,140
as well as I'm being critical of them is

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,679
there are healthy communities there.

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,920
There are bug bounties.

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,940
There are people who are
doing you know, quote unquote,

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,500
white hat hacking on Discord.

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,650
But of course we also have DDL servers,

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,790
We have spam centers, cryptocurrency

68
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,040
and shield bot bots,
stock market shield bots.

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,519
We have server, IP address paying servers.

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,623
We have password breakers and CNC servers.

71
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,600
So as I start getting
deeper into how Generation Z

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,390
is using Discord and other
platforms like Telegram

73
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,190
to hack and learn how to
hack and improve themselves

74
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,000
like a university of sorts,

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,090
I had to kind of go back
and recheck how people

76
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,560
used to hack.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
And a lot of us are used to,
you know a lot of us started

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,780
with having that C plus plus
manual or that Java manual

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,450
on the shelf back there with maybe a,

80
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,530
a library of floppy disks.

81
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,880
These days it's completely different.

82
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,970
And of course the younger
generation has a lot

83
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,960
of appreciation for how older generations

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,180
learned how to do this and
troubleshoot by themselves.

85
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,650
The modern generation, the new
ones that are coming right up

86
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,540
are connected.

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,209
They have different chat you
know, groups that they can

88
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,990
work with for troubleshooting.

89
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,260
They can meet people.

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,870
They'll meet themselves on
Discord and then they'll take

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,190
the chat and continue it over
on Telegram so there's no

92
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,240
telemetry between the
two different platforms

93
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,000
for in the case of
criminal investigations.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,310
But cryptocurrency makes
their life a lot easier

95
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,060
because they can also now go
out and buy those individual

96
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,053
components that they need
for building their code.

97
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,580
Sometimes they can end up
and the prices are here

98
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,479
on the screen but there are
times where they will struggle

99
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,690
with building that boot locker
or building some other type

100
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,580
of mod, module within the code.

101
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,969
And so they'll go shop for that, buy it.

102
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,060
And by the way, all these modules

103
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,753
and things I'm talking about,
come with customer support.

104
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,250
Now these people also engage in contests

105
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,010
and things like hack the box
to really improve their skills.

106
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,530
But there comes to a
point where you want to

107
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,570
prove your skills on a different plane.

108
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,840
And this is where
hacking becomes attacking

109
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,070
versus defending.

110
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,695
And this is where the
story gets a little dark.

111
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,040
(Brook sniffling)

112
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,270
To try to prove or
quantify to the people that

113
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,210
I was giving this abstract to

114
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,200
before I gave this presentation.

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,510
They said, "Can you quantify it?"

116
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,700
Well I can give some analogies
and some stories here.

117
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,990
If you wanted to compare, say Koobface.

118
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,190
Koobface was one of the most
notorious strains of malware

119
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,800
in 2010, roughly 10 years back. (sniffles)

120
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,570
It took roughly five young
people, five young men,

121
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,860
roughly nine to 12 months
based on who you're talking to

122
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,310
to build Koobface and become
a scourge across networks

123
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,760
across the world.

124
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,450
Fast forward about 10 years later,

125
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,349
a similar sized crew.

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,860
I can't get into the
specifics, of a younger age

127
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,099
with the modern tools
that are available to them

128
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
were able to make an
equivalent of ransomware,

129
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:09,120
the equivalent of, to SamSam ransomware

130
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,820
which is famous for locking
up five of 13 departments

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,263
in the city of Atlanta in
less than three months.

132
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,120
And the reason why it took them
only three months to do this

133
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,900
is that it could have been much faster.

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,090
That's the scary thing about this.

135
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,630
They, HILDACRYPT struggled
with the boot locker

136
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,370
and the runner on the malware
to make sure that it runs

137
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,220
in memory of the system for
more difficult detection

138
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,360
for you and forensic investigation.

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,450
And they wanted to do it themselves.

140
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,140
So through Discord and
through Telegram they,

141
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,789
they did their own troubleshooting

142
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,120
with some people that they know.

143
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,150
They were able to get
the boot locker to run,

144
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,250
to work the way they wanted it to.

145
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,250
And then set up Discord to be
that a Q and A center for them

146
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,308
and that kind of customer
support center for them

147
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:01,349
where they can also then collect payments,

148
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,810
give out keys back to
those who were infected

149
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,180
with the ransomware strain,
then wash it to Dash then

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,130
send the money back to the
people who were participating

151
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,092
in the scam.

152
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:12,210
(thumping sound)

153
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,219
With that being said, the
purpose why they're using

154
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Discord is one is, not only
to connect with themselves

155
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,090
but allows for them to hack on the cheap.

156
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,810
And this is essential
when it comes to working

157
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,580
with Generation Z. (sniffles)

158
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,169
Is that hacking on the
cheap helps them because

159
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,630
there are times where
Discord may take an action

160
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,420
and disable the server.

161
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,770
Well they can easily replicate
their work on another server

162
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,830
and start over again. (sniffles)

163
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,340
So hacking on the cheap
and also being anonymous

164
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,359
are the two core
components for Generation Z

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,260
getting going into the
attacking side of the equation.

166
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,250
So one they're using
Discord to ping servers

167
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,440
for vulnerabilities and
credentials 24 hours a day.

168
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,271
Their Discord channels may be
just working around the clock,

169
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,410
pinging a range of IP addresses,

170
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,640
pinging a range of email
addresses with a known set of

171
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,669
either passwords or guessing passwords.

172
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,488
Guess this is what
they're doing. (sniffles)

173
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:09,780
They're using Discord as a CDN, their CDN

174
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,640
as like a C&C server.

175
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,030
They're using additional
bulletproof C&C servers.

176
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,000
Those can be a little bit more spendy.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,980
The Discord CDN, a
lesser liability for them

178
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,810
but they're using that as well.

179
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,410
They're using VPN and
encryption to hide their intent

180
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,160
as they're going from their homes' backup

181
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,311
to the servers where
they're connecting to.

182
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,180
They're spear-phishing as well.

183
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,260
But a lot of them feel
that spear-phishing is a

184
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,799
very manual process.

185
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,794
And some of them are outsourcing
spear-phishing to the,

186
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:39,750
the professionals who are better at this

187
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,053
specifically if they are
not native English speakers.

188
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,690
There's a lot of attacks
happening on non-standard ports.

189
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,480
They're trying to find more
unconventional ways to get into

190
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,130
the organization. (sniffles)

191
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,110
A lot of payments are then
of course like taken from,

192
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,240
you know BTC, Bitcoin,
and put into an Alt coin

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
like Dash or Monero.

194
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,650
Then often put back into
Bitcoin then put into, PayPal.

195
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,283
And then the money can be
withdrawn from a source like that.

196
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,340
I'll get into some stories later.

197
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,580
But ultimately there's a lot
of outsourcing, collaboration,

198
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,290
troubleshooting and buying of components

199
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,839
that happen through Discord.

200
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,790
And they're even buying ransomware strains

201
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,610
and collecting the source code too.

202
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,960
So these things are all happening.

203
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,210
And these younger people, Generation Z,

204
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,610
may have more money in the
bank than a lot of folks

205
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,980
would give them credit for.

206
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,970
And it gives them the
capability to do a lot of damage

207
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,920
if they spend that money on
building and buying more tools.

208
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,410
So let's get into some of the people

209
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,870
who are using Discord to
learn, attack and defend.

210
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,500
And like I mentioned, this is
a mixture of both attackers

211
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,520
and defenders.

212
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,929
Now before I get into this part

213
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,720
because I will also speak
about the Russian hacker

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,720
is that this is a generalized
portfolio or profile sorry,

215
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,550
of people from my sample size.

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,660
And it's not very huge.

217
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,650
I didn't interview 2000
people for this talk.

218
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,423
So there are some generalizations
that I'm making here.

219
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,220
And not everyone will fit this.

220
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,920
And if you feel that
you are in this category

221
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,543
and it doesn't fit you,
I apologize for that.

222
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,980
But based on the people
that I interviewed with

223
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,573
and spoke with, they come
from all walks of life.

224
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,339
The one common thread though
that was, I found between

225
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,720
my attackers, either
being from the you know,

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,750
an anonymous operation
or being from you know,

227
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,120
a group like HILDACRYPT or
those I was meeting on Reddit

228
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,143
as well as Discord and Telegram.

229
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,750
Their common thread is that
they're very pessimistic

230
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,400
about obstacles and their future.

231
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,430
The other thing too, is that
they've experienced some form

232
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,770
of pain or loss or betrayal.

233
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,939
There is kind of, it starts
with anger and it turns into

234
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,773
angst. (sniffles)

235
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:56,050
In the case of some of them, one,

236
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,060
his Bitcoin wallet contents
were stolen by a friend

237
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,369
that he trusted.

238
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,370
Another one was bullied
for having cheap shoes.

239
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,540
And so eventually tried
to learn how to hack

240
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,000
and attack people to get back
at his high school bullies.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,690
And even after high school
just kept on doing it

242
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,743
to corporations.

243
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,320
Another one was in a serious
relationship with a girl.

244
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,660
The father broke, of the daughter,

245
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,870
broke off the relationship,
separated them.

246
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,690
And as a revenge on the father,

247
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,030
he went after the father's company.

248
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,949
And eventually he was caught
and spent a little time

249
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,783
in jail for it.

250
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:36,230
So, these attackers start
with something like that.

251
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,450
And we'd like to say they kind
of start on a knife's edge.

252
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,130
And they all start as learners,
attackers and defenders.

253
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,689
But something is causing them
to tip over the other side

254
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,080
of that knife's blade.

255
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,410
Now again with these attackers,

256
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,209
they may also support hacktivist groups

257
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,480
in a wide range of things
from attacking companies

258
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,770
that they feel are not,
you know being transparent

259
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,050
about their issues or you
know, doing something that they

260
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,810
dislike, manipulating the
stock market for instance

261
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:07,064
(sniffles) or trying to dox pedophiles.

262
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:07,990
(thumping sound)

263
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,440
So this happens too.

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,010
But ultimately all of them
want to belong to a community.

265
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,140
And I found this to be very
true as I was knocking on doors,

266
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,420
talking to people.

267
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,319
And people say, "Okay, you're
on that side of the fence.

268
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,830
Do you wanna, you know hack?

269
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,790
Is there something you wanna go get?

270
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,670
Do you wanna build a ransomware strain?"

271
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,370
So these are things
that people are looking,

272
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,400
they wanna belong to a community.

273
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,980
Now that being said,
speaking of community,

274
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,900
we have the issue of the Russian hacker.

275
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,540
And this can be a very different sort

276
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,339
of the typical attacker

277
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,010
because of years of
separation and division.

278
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,150
Not to get into the history.

279
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,110
You can read, see my other stuff on this

280
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,943
if you wanna get into this.

281
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:51,040
We are in the Year 1054,
nearly 1000 years ago,

282
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,069
The Roman Catholic Church
and The Orthodox Church

283
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,279
split apart, giving both
reasons for people on both sides

284
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,760
of the map to point the
finger at each other,

285
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,020
thinking they're heretics and are unworthy

286
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,910
to sit before the throne of God.

287
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,339
With that being said, we're talking about

288
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,500
nearly 1000 years of war,
cultural differences,

289
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,770
political differences, Royal
intrigue, et cetera, et cetera,

290
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,850
causing the East and West
to look at each other

291
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,120
in a different light.

292
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,630
And fast forward to World
War II with Germany and the,

293
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,070
and the Soviet Union as
well as United States

294
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,230
and the Cold War afterwards
and even sanctions involving

295
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,220
with the SolarWinds attack
that were just announced

296
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,720
at the date of this recording,

297
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,610
will only further cement the,
the difference and the divide

298
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,450
between East and West.

299
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,780
And this was one of the
main motivators why Twig

300
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,780
and the HILDACRYPT crew would
go after German and US targets

301
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,930
because they felt, and you
know again it comes from

302
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,349
the propaganda that they're
digesting in Russia.

303
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,596
That, that we are unfit for
the blessings that we have

304
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,330
in these nations.

305
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,460
So again, not to defend
them but to explain them.

306
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,420
There are issues on
why they have no qualms

307
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,014
at ransomware in your
devices, your endpoints

308
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:06,503
and then having you pay a
premium to get those unlocked.

309
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,330
Even if you don't pay, they don't care.

310
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,710
They're causing damage.

311
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,040
So again, this is the
story with some of our

312
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,130
Russian attackers.

313
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,580
Now keep in mind, I'm a
big proponent of trying to

314
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,850
get people on the red side of that map

315
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,070
to be big participants of the IT world.

316
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,880
And a lot of you who are from
that portion of the world,

317
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,310
the former Soviet Union,

318
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,699
you are from a great source of people.

319
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,880
And you may not feel this way
but there is a lot of anger.

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,030
And this is what's, I'm
finding from the interviews

321
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,390
that I had within my small sample size.

322
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,680
So again, if, if I have falsely
portrayed you, I apologize.

323
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,780
That's not the intent.

324
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,110
Now a lot of you may also be

325
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,290
on the defender side of the story.

326
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,160
And like I said, they all, they
come from all walks of life.

327
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,850
Even from Eastern Europe,
former Soviet Union, China

328
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,300
and other places that us here in IT

329
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,553
want to kind of demonize.

330
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,663
With that being said,
the difference between

331
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:05,440
a defender and attacker
in those beginning stages

332
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,260
of learning and that
curiosity on how hacking works

333
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,090
and how attacking works
and how defense works

334
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,880
is that the people who fell
to this side of the story

335
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
are optimistic about
opportunities in the future.

336
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,480
And the reason why they are
that way from my experience

337
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,900
is they all have had a chance
to be rewarded somehow,

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,240
either through praise of their coworker,

339
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,840
not coworkers of their, you
know the kids in their school,

340
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,430
people who are mentoring them,

341
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,699
people who have actually
received the bug bounties

342
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,140
even if they're very small
are enough to tip these people

343
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,760
into the defender bucket
where they wanna help defend

344
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,980
and protect people.

345
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,710
And use all that teenage
energy and sometimes

346
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,030
angst and frustration
for the sake of good.

347
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,540
Now again these people, also
will support hacktivist groups.

348
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,439
And they also too want
to belong to a community

349
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,900
and maintain many public
communities for what we call

350
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,829
the you know, white hat hacking.

351
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,711
Again I apologize for the color term here.

352
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,130
(whooshing sound)

353
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,513
So the question is, you know
back to the story of Discord,

354
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,035
is how much malware is actually on this.

355
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:14,980
(mouse clicking)

356
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,380
Now my sources are the
Discord Trust and Safety

357
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,220
Transparency Report.

358
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,160
Now there have been two produced so far

359
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,670
and the third one is past due.

360
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,510
And we have asked for, lot of,

361
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,010
we've supplied lots of
inquiries to Discord

362
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,620
to comment on this or give us
data so we can help represent

363
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,990
them better in terms of them
responding to these issues.

364
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,820
But we have, it's been kind of silent

365
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,690
and we've had some contact
and expect that once this airs

366
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,920
we'll have a statement and
maybe that new report comes out.

367
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,969
But I'll keep my ears to the ground.

368
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,970
In the first 3/4 of 2019,
it produced what is called

369
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,470
the first half of 2019 report,
there was 129,000 reports.

370
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,170
You can see that, you know
hacks and cheats were at 16.8%.

371
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,339
Now we're seeing spam at 11.3%.

372
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,560
And malware was at 1.8%.

373
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,470
Now fast forward to the next half,

374
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,470
which is only 2/4 of data,
we see 235,000 reports,

375
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,000
because of the volume
of reports coming up.

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,810
A lot of those reports
by the way, are sorry,

377
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,579
they're coming from
the defenders out there

378
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,649
who are trying to stop the attackers

379
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,750
because they get pulled
into these hacking subgroups

380
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,683
or servers.

381
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,850
They'll play coy and then
they'll turn the tables

382
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,159
on the attackers and
report them all to Discord

383
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,740
where then they have to,
you know rebuild profiles

384
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,010
and everything else.

385
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,810
So but, the team has
doubled since that time.

386
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,129
They've broken up hacks,
cybercrime from hacks and cheats

387
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,360
which was in one category. (sniffles)

388
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,280
Now that's at five to,
5.2% of these reports.

389
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,123
Spam rose to 12% and malware at 2.9%.

390
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,200
And you can see here from the screen

391
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,980
that even though there was
a rise in overall reports,

392
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,070
there was a rise over
that for spam, malware

393
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,360
and hacks and crimes
specifically for malware.

394
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,040
And again I had to play
with some of the data here

395
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,990
so it didn't, you know skew
too much but you can see here

396
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,352
what those percentage
increases were in this case.

397
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:19,510
(sniffles) So with that being said,

398
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,530
there's a lot of reports.

399
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,180
People are trying to actively
stop things from happening

400
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,570
on Discord. (sniffles)

401
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,560
But Discord seems to focus on two things.

402
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,300
One is spam and the other
on is exploitive content.

403
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,540
Spam is what hurts them
because it fills their,

404
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,110
it takes up their bandwidth
spamming people on,

405
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,449
you know in servers and
machines, et cetera.

406
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,850
So they will really wanna cut that out

407
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,230
for their cost management, I get that.

408
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,420
Now the exploitive content,
I do not want to distract

409
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,253
from that.

410
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,750
This includes child
sexual abuse imagery and

411
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,270
as a member of the IWF and
SonicWall is a paying sponsor

412
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,560
of the IWF to really help
eliminate child sexual abuse

413
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,889
imagery online.

414
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,390
Big mission, we do not
wanna distract from that.

415
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,660
However, we do see that
responding to malware

416
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,290
and cybercrime, it takes a far back seat

417
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,230
to some of these other issues.

418
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,310
Again, we don't wanna
take away from you know,

419
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,830
the, the good fight that they're doing

420
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,870
to remove exploitive content
from, you know their network.

421
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,949
But again, the verdict is
that they're gonna focus

422
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,230
on what either hurts them
or makes them look bad.

423
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,474
And the statistics show that
if someone reports cybercrime

424
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:30,080
or malware, there's
roughly only a 33% chance

425
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,960
that Discord will actually take an action

426
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,650
against the report.

427
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,890
Which furthermore causes a lot
of the defenders to lose hope

428
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,500
that there is a chance to win this battle.

429
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,870
Now when you take a look
at the virus total map

430
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,080
of the Discord CDN, you're
gonna see it's used as a,

431
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,350
C&C server.

432
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,110
There's APKs, executables,
archives, et cetera, all there.

433
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,159
And a lot of these are able
to be accessed or downloaded

434
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,123
without having an account.

435
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,160
So again, the attackers
are using Discord CDN

436
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,033
like a C&C server.

437
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,230
So let's cover a couple of
the trends that we're seeing,

438
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,390
you know with these
Generations Z hackers today.

439
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,080
So one is the, big trend
is obviously trying to move

440
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,199
everything within to you
know, memory-based execution.

441
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,360
Fileless Malware is gonna be
the big one that a lot of folks

442
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,503
are focusing on, again for the forensic,

443
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,800
the ability to not find this
through forensic analysis,

444
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,010
the ability to try to evade detection.

445
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,908
So once it lands into mel,
into memory it'll execute.

446
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:36,570
So that is the goal,
like Fileless Malware.

447
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,250
It's what everyone's trying to do now

448
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,821
with their current strains that they have.

449
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,290
(thumping sound)

450
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,300
They employ common evation tactics.

451
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,550
These are not new to you.

452
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,720
This is old news but this
is still very much a thing.

453
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
And my favorite used to
be server ransomware,

454
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,170
that used to run eight
different evasion tactics

455
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,060
to get past sandboxing and AAV, et cetera.

456
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,929
So, a memory-based execution
is considered to be

457
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,860
like an evation tactic here.

458
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,310
But essentially, you know
we're seeing this here.

459
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,800
Again, these people are
also largely looking at

460
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,330
a well-known and publicized
CVs and vulnerabilities

461
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,600
to go after those common issues.

462
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,699
But there are some of those
who will actually go off very

463
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,703
niche vulnerabilities as well.

464
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,130
Now one way to try and get
past a lot of advanced malware

465
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,370
scanners like in sandboxing, et cetera.

466
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,540
Is that they're trying
to infect attachments

467
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,020
that are rarely examined or
scanned by those technologies,

468
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,990
specifically by the job
roles that they're targeting

469
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,210
in their malware attacks.

470
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,083
So for example, Vbox is
one that Twig identified

471
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,880
within HILDACRYPT.

472
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,390
Because no one is scanning Vbox files,

473
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,030
and I'm targeting these IT
admins and these executives

474
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,570
who are using this file type
and to infect them and then

475
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,669
work my way backwards.

476
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,129
And then we're also seeing
a lot of reports these days,

477
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,440
sorry attacks these days
on Ports 5900 and 5901

478
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,800
which are the VNC ports to
enable attackers to move sideways

479
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,129
across networks.

480
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,890
Because in 2016 it was largely,
they tried to spray and prey

481
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,760
everybody.

482
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,900
Locky ransomware, good
example of a ransomware strain

483
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,280
who was locking up everybody and anybody,

484
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,220
including grandmothers
and people who had no idea

485
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,850
what Bitcoin was or even
how to obtain Bitcoin

486
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,980
just to unlock their grandchildren's
photos that were saved

487
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,470
on the computer. (sniffles)

488
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,160
These days we're seeing a
lot more targeted attacks.

489
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,830
We've seen an actual 42% drop
in malware as an organization

490
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,090
last year and a large rise in new attacks

491
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,939
through our real-time deep
memory inspection engine

492
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,430
here at SonicWall, showing
that targeted attacks

493
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,090
are far more real.

494
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,720
And by seeing here that
directory traversal is now,

495
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,880
has doubled over the year before

496
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,440
and is now the number one
intrusion kind of tactic

497
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,610
that we're seeing being
used in the year 2020

498
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,260
because we're trying to go after,

499
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,530
less number of targets
and find juicer targets

500
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,399
that, where we can spread sideways

501
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,567
and infect more of the
organization with our attack.

502
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:13,960
(mouse clicking)

503
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,287
So now I'm gonna share with you
kind of the application here

504
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:19,070
and how we can stop attacks
in the platform today.

505
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,669
And of course we're gonna cover,

506
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,773
how we're going to stop attacks
tomorrow and the future.

507
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,340
So one, we need to stop attacks
from Discord and Telegram.

508
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,832
For if any reason Discord is
completely obliterated by,

509
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,230
you know off the face of the earth,

510
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,150
Telegram will take its place.

511
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,120
But Discord has the majority
of the focus right now

512
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,379
of these attackers.

513
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,700
So they'll operate off of
Discord and usually communicate

514
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,820
in Telegram, and they're
used both at the same time

515
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,822
in many cases.

516
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,640
So one is we need to block
connections from the firewall

517
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,670
and also any botnet protections.

518
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,090
We need to treat Discord and
Telegram like a C&C server

519
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,610
and block access to it.

520
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,719
Now, if you need to use Discord
and Telegram for business

521
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,650
for any reason, we
recommend to only allow it

522
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,883
through port 443, but only
with application filters.

523
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,200
Secondly, you need to also
maybe consider running it into,

524
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,740
running it in a VM if you need to use it

525
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,440
is a another comment by (mumbles).

526
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,070
But ultimately there are better decisions

527
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,480
and better options out
there for team productivity

528
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,730
out there that range from
Microsoft teams to others,

529
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,762
Slack, there's all.

530
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,913
I'm not gonna recommend
any right now but you know.

531
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,620
Now of course, I'm also
calling on chat platforms

532
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,600
like Discord and Telegram
to better diagnose

533
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,090
and seriously inspect
the reports from users,

534
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,510
namely when it comes to malware and,

535
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,633
and hacking overall and in general.

536
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,780
But also I believe that all of
us need to better understand

537
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,100
the attacker.

538
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,570
Because that will also give
us a way to stop attacks

539
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,403
in the future.

540
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,486
Now in my time talking
with anonymous attackers,

541
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:05,840
you know the HILDACRYPT story
which I'm, you know known for

542
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,850
and I did a talk at RSA APJ on this one,

543
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,796
Is that I asked for advice and said,

544
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:12,773
"Okay, you've told me your story.

545
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,910
What advice do you have for
people like us who are trying

546
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,520
to protect ourselves from you?"

547
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,070
And they're willing to give it.

548
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,240
Roughly 98% of all the attacks
that we're seeing out there

549
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,843
can be stopped with proper hygiene.

550
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,200
You know it's, we come
to this tech conferences

551
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,780
to learn about the newest technology

552
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,480
or what we could have bought
that could have saved us,

553
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,060
saved us from the last
fire we had to put out.

554
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,210
But ultimately, 98% of all
these attacks can be stopped

555
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,273
with proper hygiene.

556
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
The, and part of that is
using proper passwords.

557
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,740
Our IT admins are using, they're
not following those advice,

558
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,330
pieces of advice and those best practices.

559
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,090
And, Twig from the HILDACRYPT
story that I told you about,

560
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,110
his favorite password he ever cracked,

561
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,870
was just two quotation marks.

562
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,310
Yes, password crackers
even check for those

563
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,120
little small minuscule
passwords as well. (sniffles)

564
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,030
So test for firewall misconfiguration.

565
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,840
This is a big one, misconfigured
firewalls like putting

566
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,543
a lockout backwards on the door.

567
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,050
You need to train
employees on cyber attacks.

568
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,570
This is usually one of
the best things you can do

569
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,473
so that they don't launch an attack.

570
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,090
If you're doing, again this is
more of a controversial step,

571
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,050
but consider using men in
the middle or you know,

572
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,680
men in the middle in
inspection of encrypted traffic

573
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,220
into networks for that inspection.

574
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,090
Roughly 70% of all network
connections are encrypted today.

575
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,620
And a lot of those, you know malware,

576
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,860
and all the malwares being
pulled through encrypted traffic.

577
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,300
And if your firewall or
whatever you're using,

578
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,340
doesn't have the ability
to inspect that traffic

579
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,927
as it's going through, then it has to,

580
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:56,149
you have to rely on your
endpoint security to solve that.

581
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,633
And I'll talk about that too.

582
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,070
Also email security
needs to have an advanced

583
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,290
malware detection module.

584
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,610
Relying on static defenses
and in spam scrubbers

585
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,370
is not the way that you
wanna go with email security.

586
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,030
You should have been on, you
should be using something

587
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,510
like that at least since
2015 at a minimum. (sniffles)

588
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,650
And also deploy sandboxing
with memory-based analysis

589
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,770
wherever you can, because
all these different

590
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,810
even file-based files attacks

591
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,080
are trying to launch in the memory.

592
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,590
And that's where the sandboxing component

593
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,790
with memory-based analysis
is really gonna save you

594
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,420
from a lot of these new attacks
that we're seeing coming

595
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,213
from Generation Z off the
Discord platform, et cetera.

596
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,030
Now I'm also gonna recommend
heuristic anti-malware

597
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,090
on endpoints.

598
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,320
Now this is the less controversial
option when it comes to

599
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,179
dealing with encrypted threats.

600
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,620
Some of us don't wanna use
men in the middle inspection

601
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,989
because of privacy concerns or two,

602
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,840
because of the difficulty
and how things break.

603
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,159
And you know all the exceptions
you have to build into

604
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,970
men in the middle inspection.

605
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,310
Heuristic anti-malware
technology that we're seeing

606
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,980
on endpoints is vital in this day and age

607
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,204
especially as people are
working from home in mass.

608
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,053
Namely, thanks to the pandemic.

609
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,697
Of course secondly on this page is,

610
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:17,969
how to secure vulnerable ports,
I mentioned this already.

611
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,820
An interesting one is to write
programs in a more secure

612
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,240
language and then penetration test them.

613
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,300
That was one of the most
interesting points that I got

614
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,120
out of talking with Twig
and HILDACRYPT was that,

615
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,120
if they would break into an
organization and they saw that,

616
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,179
they found programs that were
coded in Java they would think

617
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,060
we have lazy programmers and
older people working here.

618
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,210
So let me see if we can
do some damage here.

619
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,530
And of course they also
recommend hand in hand to hire

620
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,010
more skilled and disciplined staff.

621
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,629
Because, let's get away from
the whole age and all the other

622
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,110
different things that we
try to label people with.

623
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,760
It doesn't matter what about one's age,

624
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,340
it's about one's ability.

625
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,470
Do you have the skills and
do you have the discipline

626
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,730
to follow best practices for security?

627
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,410
Specifically if you are
building applications

628
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,280
for the company and, and
that's again, a very big one.

629
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,730
And again, these are pieces
of advice that actually

630
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,031
come from attackers in my interviews.

631
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:18,864
(mouse clicking)

632
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:20,880
So now comes the big question which is

633
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,810
one of my favorite ways and
favorite things to think about

634
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,403
is more the social side of it,

635
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,653
is how can we stop attacks in the future?

636
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,910
Now the immediate attack
actions for IT, you can do now.

637
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,263
Those are not so future based.

638
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:39,480
There's one, stick to security hygiene

639
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,060
including your passwords.

640
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,270
Don't just force employees
and your internal customers

641
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,533
to do that.

642
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,780
You need to block access to
Discord and Telegram servers.

643
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,520
And you need to restrict
administrative rights from users.

644
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,770
As much as I love having
my administrative rights

645
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,410
to my endpoint, Microsoft will
tell you that 95% of all tax

646
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,960
can be stopped if you just
restrict administrative rights

647
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,853
from the users.

648
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,340
Now of course for future
actions, tomorrow.

649
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,270
We support bug bounty programs.

650
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,340
It doesn't have to be big, okay?

651
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,810
One person, one defender that I mentioned,

652
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,710
I had his picture up on the screen.

653
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,490
His name is David Colombo,
started a company 18,

654
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,470
without going to college,
just wants to protect people.

655
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,800
He said and he's a big proponent
of bug bounty programs.

656
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,941
And this is one of the
reasons why he is a defender

657
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,790
and not an attacker.

658
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,690
As he instructed me,
please tell people that if,

659
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,690
if they can report to Red Bull

660
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,860
that they have a vulnerability
somewhere in their system,

661
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,919
they will send you cases
and cases of Red Bull.

662
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,480
So it's these simple things,

663
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,430
you don't have to send
large six figure payouts

664
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,060
for bug bounty programs.

665
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,570
You can do companies swag or
something that will benefit

666
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,610
them or just give them,
almost like a trophy

667
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,209
to put on their walls and say,
"You know, I got this t-shirt

668
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,650
or I got this thing from the
company because I identified

669
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,670
a vulnerability."

670
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,890
Now again, try to provide more than that.

671
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,170
But if you wanna start with something,

672
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,930
start with company swag
and work your way upwards

673
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,280
to give someone something.

674
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,610
A chance to do the right thing.

675
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,110
We wanna incentivize the right behavior.

676
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,419
We're part of this world.

677
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,050
And the attackers and defenders

678
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,680
are part of the same ecosystem.

679
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,950
And the more people we
can become defenders,

680
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,060
the less likely that we'll
have to deal with the problems

681
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,393
from the attackers.

682
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,480
Again, write a more secure
programming language,

683
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,820
penetration test these things,

684
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,250
handle your issues with transparency.

685
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,950
I mentioned hacktivist efforts a lot

686
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,090
because a lot of my time I
am spending it with activists

687
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,340
or hacktivists namely anonymous attackers

688
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,050
and the different operations
that they have. (sniffles)

689
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,320
No comments or opinions
on what they're doing

690
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,610
but also handle your
issues with transparency.

691
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,790
It's gonna probably
save you a lot of cases.

692
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,213
We're seeing this now in
the case of, you know,

693
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,460
police situations with
our ongoing climate today.

694
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,270
I was actively interviewing
people during the George Floyd

695
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,389
protests that were
happening in Minneapolis

696
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,820
and across the United States

697
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,970
and some parts of the other world too.

698
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,210
And so handling these with transparency

699
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,400
and working with the public
is a very good way to avoid

700
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,723
the brunt of some of these hacktivists.

701
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,240
Secondly, reconsider
your hiring requirements

702
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,260
for Generation Z.

703
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,888
And I'm gonna get into that in
just a couple of slides here.

704
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:23,840
(mouse clicking)

705
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,959
Now again like I mentioned,
we need to incentivize

706
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,350
the right behavior.

707
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,030
We need to issue a bug bounty program

708
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,370
that enables you to reward
people for finding problems.

709
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,280
On the right is a quote from
one of the people I interviewed

710
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,420
that said, "You know when
I'm 13, 14 years old,

711
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,670
I have all the energy in the world.

712
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,870
I wanna do something.

713
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,239
And I you know, I'm so hungry to learn."

714
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,713
Much hungry than you and me.

715
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,876
But we can't give them jobs.

716
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,290
We can't hire a 13-year-old, can you?

717
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,940
But, the problem is
that they need something

718
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,580
but you can send them cases of Red Bull.

719
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,350
You can send them gifts.

720
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,230
You can do things.

721
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,136
Yeah, get them involved
in doing the right thing

722
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:04,530
and develop that muscle memory
for doing the right thing.

723
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,840
Experts, people or those who
are older, older generations,

724
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,730
help people, mentor people.

725
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,830
And ultimately if we give
people employment opportunities

726
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,020
especially when they become of age,

727
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,190
we give them an opportunity
to do the right thing.

728
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,310
We give them a chance to lose something

729
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,139
if they do the wrong thing.

730
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,300
Incentivize the right behavior.

731
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,720
Now with that being said,
we're looking at the future

732
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,660
workforce now.

733
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,390
Generation Z, I have a lot of
hope for these, these people.

734
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,640
Men and women, all across the
board, all across the world,

735
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,370
Generation Z has much
more hope for this world

736
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,350
than my own generation.

737
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,159
I truly believe it. (sniffles)

738
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,970
We need to consider hiring
people of a younger age

739
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,960
who may not have a post
high school education.

740
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,470
Our attackers out there are not optimistic

741
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,830
about going to college.

742
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,540
Our defenders however, will
look for certifications.

743
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,337
And in my interviews
with them they're asking,

744
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:56,091
"What can I do to get
a job in your company

745
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:57,520
when I'm old enough?"

746
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,353
Okay.

747
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,900
So look for certifications and skillsets.

748
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,160
Look for women getting involved
in technical roles, okay?

749
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,370
There's looking at things
that more women wanna see

750
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,210
more women in office
and they wanna see them

751
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,520
more in the data center.

752
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,409
So look to hiring women as
well for technical roles.

753
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,399
There are women who are
out there actively trying

754
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,250
to become hackers and defenders.

755
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,670
So look at what's going on.

756
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,429
There is a big wave of women
coming into these roles.

757
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,620
They're also gonna be more
sensitive about the human link

758
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,453
to climate change.

759
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:28,320
So if you're a hardware
vendor, look at how your,

760
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,260
look for greener solutions.

761
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,659
And consider hiring from
the former Soviet Union.

762
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,199
I'm originally, from
Western Europe you could say

763
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,739
and I have no skin in the game here.

764
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,310
But I really strongly
believe if we give folks

765
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,029
from the former former
Soviet Union the benefit,

766
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,340
the benefit of the doubt
and give them opportunity

767
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,860
to be hired by Western companies,

768
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,053
we can really solve the
need for people to hack.

769
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,120
There's lot of these people,

770
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,410
they have to work a state
salary and it's not enough

771
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,600
to support the way they want to live.

772
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
So they will do things on the
side, convert the you know,

773
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,350
like ransomware, convert the
coin and then go get the money

774
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,279
from a local bodega to
then go buy groceries.

775
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,470
So again, in a country where
doctors make less than $2,000

776
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,189
a month, you could take
the same amount of money

777
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,730
to hire a C plus plus
programmer, web developers.

778
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,040
Now again, in my search,
in my research on this,

779
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,640
I'm finding that you know,
one of the top Google search

780
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,960
results about Russians
is, can you trust them

781
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,750
especially when it comes to tech?

782
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,320
So if you're having troubles
with trust just yet,

783
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,760
never share the full code base online.

784
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,090
Host with limited access.

785
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,510
Use AWS Team Foundation Server
if you're running on batt.

786
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,750
Always use project management
software when you can.

787
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,910
And always ask for the raw code after,

788
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,750
at the end of the project.

789
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,203
And again, this is when
you're talking about

790
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:54,960
dealing with contractors.

791
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,200
But again, the former Soviet
Union is a great place to hire.

792
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,899
It has a lot of opportunity.

793
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,940
So not just Generation
Z coming up as well.

794
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,340
So that being said, I
strongly believe that hiring

795
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,790
is a way to try to deter attackers

796
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,540
and ultimately make for a
healthier ecosystem. (sniffles)

797
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,870
So again, I'd like to thank
you for your time today.

798
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,787
My name is BR Chelmo, Brook Chelmo.

799
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:20,270
And you're welcome to chat
with me on Twitter afterwards

800
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,560
and of course in the Q and A session.

801
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,450
So again, thank you very much.
