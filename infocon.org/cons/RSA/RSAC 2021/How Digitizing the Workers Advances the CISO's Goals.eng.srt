1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,480
- So hello, I'm Chris
Sullivan, I'm the CEO of Nymi.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,870
With me is Tim Callahan

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,077
the Global CSO for Aflac.

4
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:08,350
And we certainly wanna start

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,260
by expressing our
appreciation for your time.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,214
To give us an opportunity to talk

7
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,370
about some of the things
we've been working on.

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,059
I will tell you just a
little bit of background.

9
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,892
Over the years, Tim

10
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:21,880
and I work together on many
sort of innovative projects.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,262
Sort of nascent problems
within the industry.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,419
It's gotta be 15-20 years ago

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,980
on the very first project

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,570
that our very first meeting, Tim told me

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,993
that if we failed, he would get fired.

16
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,830
And he assured me that if he get fired

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,739
I would get fired as well.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,610
So that sort of set the tone,
but I think over the years

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,400
we've got a very successful partnership.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,269
And today we're gonna talk to you more

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,570
about sort of digitizing
the active workforce.

22
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,603
Next slide Tim, thanks.

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,839
So, yeah, we're gonna
talk about our experience

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,670
in connecting the workforce in a manner

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,980
that from a security and privacy
perspective is very strong.

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,039
Also provides resiliency sort of,

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,030
and value across the rest
of the executive suite.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,640
There is a bit of a nudge

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,370
to the pandemic and the
use case they will talk

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,600
about is COVID since that's current.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,993
But this is really not
about pandemic response.

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,020
There was actually a CDC campaign

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,740
in around 2012 that Tim
connected to and I think

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,910
he'll or had a connection with.

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,320
And I think he'll talk more about that

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,449
but the idea was the CDC came out

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,800
and said, imagine
anything that can happen.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,700
Imagine if there was a zombie apocalypse,

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
and that was the campaign preparing

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,570
for the zombie apocalypse,
but that really leaves you

41
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,979
to how do you prepare
for anything that happen?

42
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,120
How do you prepare for sort

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,430
of in Donald Rumsfeld
terms, "unknown unknown"

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,130
is coming at you, and that's sort

45
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,283
of the purpose of the talk today.

46
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,900
But with that, maybe
I'll turn it over to Tim.

47
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,170
He can talk about a little bit

48
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,950
of the context for this at Aflac.

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,380
- Yeah, I will first, I
wanna walk a little bit

50
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,359
through history and the history

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,220
of the information security
program and the model.

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,053
And I can,

53
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,269
I've been fortunate to have
worked in information security

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,110
for a long time as Sullivan pointed out.

55
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,720
But I can remember when it
was all about compliance.

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,263
I worked for a bank
after my military career,

57
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:32,660
I worked for a bank and
our biggest emphasis

58
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,480
at the time was make sure that
we were regulatory compliant.

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,320
That we could continue to
operate a bank without any

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,920
of regulatory structures.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,880
Not that we weren't worried about security

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,740
is just the threat was not
as looming then as it is now.

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,210
So we were very focused on compliance.

64
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,900
And then the threat started to increase

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,770
and we did in fact find out

66
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,550
like many companies did that, compliance

67
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,110
and security are not
necessarily the same thing.

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,870
That you can be compliant

69
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,360
but not necessarily have
a good security program.

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
So, again, the industry started shifting

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,780
and we shifted into more maintaining

72
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,020
our compliance, certainly
that's table stakes

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,300
to be in business especially

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,960
for regulated entities, but making sure

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,960
that we could protect
our environment as well.

76
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,600
And then we started talking

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,530
about maturity and maturation
and how to measure that.

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,729
And if you're going to be compliant

79
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,700
if you're gonna be secure,
how do you know that?

80
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,000
And so we talked about
frameworks and maturity models

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,123
and things like that in order to do that.

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,010
And then we started, after many breaches

83
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,010
in the US, you started to start thinking

84
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,423
about defensibility, what does that mean?

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,430
How would I defend this decision

86
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,290
if something bad were to happen?

87
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,549
So not that that drove the program

88
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,250
but it was always kind of
in the back of the mind.

89
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,240
And now we're entering a time

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,390
where we're really
emphasizing cyber resiliency

91
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,409
and that's really acknowledging

92
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,630
we can get attack, we will get attacked

93
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:30,270
we may even suffer a type of a breach,

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,640
but being resilient enough to be able

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,900
to take that, absorb that

96
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,912
and continue business through that.

97
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,110
A good friend of mine, Richard A. Clarke

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,790
was talking at a conference.

99
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,790
He and his coauthor, Robert
Knake just published a book

100
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,350
about a year ago called,
"The Fifth Domain"

101
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,410
and they really introduced this concept

102
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,863
of cyber resiliency.

103
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,424
They, like all of us

104
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:09,060
have heard the quote about,

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,060
there's two kinds of companies,

106
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,290
the ones that have been
breached to know about

107
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,230
the ones that have not been breached

108
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,620
and didn't know about it.

109
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,394
But what they introduced is
the third type of company.

110
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:21,670
In their book, "The Fifth Domain"

111
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,350
they did research on
all kinds of companies.

112
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,160
And they found that the
cyber resilient firm,

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,030
was the one that suffers little

114
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,679
or no damage when they are hacked,

115
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
when they are penetrated.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,350
And they gave multiple examples of that.

117
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,500
So that's really, and, one reason

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
that we're shifting
towards that is to provide

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,943
that good business background.

120
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,733
Sullivan, I'm gonna pass this back to you.

121
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,217
- Sure, thanks Tim.

122
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,130
So what is the keys to resiliency?

123
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,620
Resiliency, I would think about

124
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,550
as the ability to handle those sort

125
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,460
of known unknowns and
even unknown unknowns.

126
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,190
So, it is a form of agility

127
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,730
but not a sort of special
case resility, agility.

128
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,950
That the important thing

129
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,950
is to build out a solution
that is going to deal

130
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,760
with things like security and privacy

131
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,690
in a way that you can
respond quickly, right?

132
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,010
So again, that's a form
of agility, if you will.

133
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,789
And that means you can't
build bespoke solutions,

134
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,540
meaning I wanna solve for
this specific problem,

135
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,450
I wanna use this approach
for that specific problem,

136
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,320
I wanna use that approach.

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,614
Because that is inherently
sort of difficult to change.

138
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:45,450
So, we wanna embrace these philosophies

139
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,050
of we have to be able to do a change.

140
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,760
We wanna build a service
that we can respond with.

141
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,969
That's the fundamental point.

142
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,063
So, there's a lot, lots to thing about.

143
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,402
- Yeah, and...

144
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,235
(mumbles)

145
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:02,080
Yeah, when we, kind of peel
that back in this, again,

146
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,467
this presentation is about how

147
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:07,550
we at Aflac have kind of
gone through this journey.

148
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,460
We adopted the "all
hazards" approach in 2017

149
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,640
and it was really from experience I had

150
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,479
at my previous company is, as Sullivan

151
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,830
had talked about, when the CDC launched

152
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,210
this zombie apocalypse campaign,

153
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,729
I was with another company responsible

154
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,810
for crisis management, as
I am at my present company.

155
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,900
And in adopting this
"all hazards" approach,

156
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,049
really gives us the flexibility.

157
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,810
It really creates an environment

158
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,540
of resiliency because what we find

159
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,340
is that most hazards have
similar things in common,

160
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,897
whether it's a physical
or logical, whatever.

161
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,540
Some of the things that they have

162
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,540
in common is that, just getting up

163
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,623
to speed very early and
the process is important.

164
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,679
Why I refer to that as
the fog of war, right?

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
In the early stages of anything,

166
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
you find that there's
disinformation, sometimes intentional

167
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,950
by a criminal element,
sometimes it's unintentional.

168
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,150
But there is this figuring
out what's really there.

169
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,200
Well, the "all hazards"
approach accommodates that.

170
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,420
And then you have different
scenarios for different types

171
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,290
of events, but it
embraces the commonality.

172
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,039
We shifted back in 2017, we shifted

173
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,039
to from a facility
centric model of recovery

174
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,990
to one of work anywhere.

175
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,750
Now, when we did that,

176
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,130
we had in mind, several events,
this "all hazards" approach.

177
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,670
One of them was in fact, a pandemic.

178
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,020
And we found out that in this pandemic

179
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,689
we were able to mobilize our teams

180
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,930
to and out of work

181
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,020
from home work from anywhere
kind of model, very rapidly

182
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,780
because we had planned for that.

183
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,910
We had installed the technology,

184
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,360
the security we had exercised it.

185
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,770
So, we were able to
mobilize fairly quickly.

186
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,079
Not that we didn't, have
some lessons learned,

187
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,410
but a lot of the kinds

188
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,209
of things that we had planned for,

189
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,370
for instance, not totally related

190
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,060
but very beneficial is we had really been

191
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,859
on a campaign for both the environment,

192
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,560
for security reasons

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,930
of emphasizing a paperless work process.

194
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,030
And many companies that
I've talked to, one

195
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,490
of the biggest things,
especially one like ours,

196
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,350
where it's kind of a claims process.

197
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,680
There's a workflow kind of process.

198
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,420
Oftentimes they were very
heavily dependent on paper.

199
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,530
We benefited because
we had started breaking

200
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,630
our dependence on paper.

201
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,330
And again, it was a
conscious intentional thing

202
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,000
to do that we reaped benefit from.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,573
But that really speaks

204
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,223
of resiliency and how we did that.

205
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,290
And then what we found is that

206
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,400
we had all kinds of security
tools in our environment.

207
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,990
We had a very mature threat
intelligence platform.

208
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,630
We had a data aggregation platform

209
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,173
in order to help inform that
threat intelligence mechanism.

210
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
We had a process where we ingested logs

211
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,060
from our physical access, badging system.

212
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,260
We ingested logs from machines

213
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,120
from the internet, et cetera.

214
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,450
So, we were able to use
that and leverage that

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,300
in a digital way in order
to inform us, for instance

216
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,370
when our main area,
where our main campus is,

217
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,433
when they impose the
strictest restrictions

218
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,719
on shelter in place,

219
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,820
we had to evacuate our
building, so to speak.

220
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,300
And in order to monitor that
and see how well we were doing

221
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,579
and how well our employees were logging

222
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,110
on and how well they were working,

223
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,970
we were able to leverage
this digital environment

224
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,373
that we had built.

225
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,270
We monitored how many
people were still badging

226
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,360
into the buildings, we monitored

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,320
who was coming up online
from a remote capacity.

228
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,060
And we were able to monitor
the quality of their servers,

229
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,050
those kinds of things

230
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,652
in order to make adjustments throughout.

231
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,213
With that, I'm gonna hand
it back over to Sullivan.

232
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,690
- Sure, thanks Tim.

233
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,298
So, we can go to the next slide.

234
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,390
We're gonna talk a little bit

235
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,540
about maybe putting
some meat on the bones.

236
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,120
We talked about the complexity of,

237
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,110
or the challenge of dealing

238
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,560
with complexity especially
when there's unknowns.

239
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,610
And if you think about the way we solve,

240
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,410
just driving this back
to CISO's perspective,

241
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,480
the way we solve the
access problems today.

242
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,313
Unfortunately we do

243
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:23,319
it in point solutions kind of fashion.

244
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,410
So we think about
physical access controls,

245
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,719
getting into buildings.

246
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,690
There's typically a card system for that.

247
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,900
Some are more secure than others.

248
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,083
That's sort of one physical control point.

249
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,100
We think about what you
do to lock a terminal.

250
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,180
It's typically a terminal
that's a classic trade

251
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,579
off with sort of the friction imposed

252
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,000
on the workers to get stronger security.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,300
So, I'm gonna lock your terminal.

254
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,310
If it's inactive, that's
pretty easy to beat.

255
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,439
If you walk away from the terminal

256
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,430
for me to keep either your
mouse and your keyboard active

257
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,520
I could just put your mouse

258
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,810
on the analog watch and
it will stay active.

259
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,959
So, it's not very secure.

260
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,280
And again, it imposes
(mumbles) the system.

261
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,459
People are in different places

262
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,700
with respect to the multi
factor authentication.

263
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,420
Do I use that just for privilege
access management systems?

264
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,870
Do I do ask whether there's log ons,

265
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,140
am I trying to give
password for this login?

266
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,199
So, in the net of it is just talking about

267
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
there's sort of CISO's problem

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,420
of how do I identify that this

269
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,150
is the right person doing the right thing

270
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,430
at the right time.

271
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,969
It's very difficult.

272
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,780
There's lots of different systems involved

273
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,079
that makes agility or
resiliency more difficult.

274
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,870
And it also puts a burden on the user.

275
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,240
I use different systems

276
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,830
and UIs for these different things.

277
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,910
So, that's sort of state of the union,

278
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,130
the way most companies approach

279
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,009
the problem, say what

280
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:48,123
we're advocating, next slide please then,

281
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,920
is then you think about that differently?

282
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,380
You think about, I have
problems that I have to solve.

283
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,280
If I solve it one time for the enterprise,

284
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,560
then I can do that in a
much, much better way.

285
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,569
So, if I think about replacing all

286
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,910
of these discrete or
bespoke solutions to say,

287
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,360
I need to know how I
do identify that person

288
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,810
and be assured that it's them.

289
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,212
In Tim's example of shelter in place,

290
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:15,210
with the initial phases

291
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,270
of the pandemic response,
that means I need to know

292
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,290
that it's really you at
the edge of the network

293
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,219
and you're not sitting in
your office spending more.

294
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,450
You might be sitting in Starbucks,

295
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,040
you might be sitting at home.

296
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,170
So, it's a different kind of challenge.

297
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,370
And so what we're advocating

298
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,480
and what we're building out together today

299
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,650
is there's a service, if you will

300
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,189
that when you connect the
work in the work space,

301
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,960
you get a service, it's
independent of location.

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,910
Think about the zero-trust
model, beyondcorp,

303
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,860
that kind of stuff in network.

304
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,980
It provides a uniform level
of privacy, a uniform level

305
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,670
of security and really a natural
user experience regardless

306
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,939
of which systems you're logging into

307
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,846
or which domains you're
logging into or what have you.

308
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:03,830
So, it's a bit more difficult to think

309
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,510
about that next use case
that you wanna solve.

310
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,900
But I think you'll see
it's a far more powerful

311
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,449
and agile and fit into that resilient way

312
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,870
to go about the world.

313
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,340
I think about this, 25 years ago,

314
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,450
I was building global router
networks for major financials.

315
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,440
And what had happened there
is everybody connected

316
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,833
the different, they started
connecting work groups together.

317
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,490
They, then they had a finance group,

318
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,960
and then they had some other groups.

319
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,790
Then they started connecting them together

320
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,349
in this bespoke fashion.

321
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,210
Eventually the networks got very fragile

322
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,440
and very difficult to change

323
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,360
and we almost flipped,
there was like a moment

324
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,220
in the industry where
everyone just started building

325
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,480
his global router networks.

326
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,500
It was a service to connect
computing to the network.

327
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,600
You didn't have to think about

328
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,890
it if you were in Kolhapur

329
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,760
or New York City or what have you, right?

330
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,420
So, I think about connecting the worker,

331
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,130
we think about connecting
workers as much the same idea,

332
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,330
do it once, do it correctly,

333
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,343
you get efficiency and
scale and resiliency.

334
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,040
So, these are things you might think

335
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,209
about when you connect to the worker.

336
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,970
The first bit is how do I know

337
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,380
that is you and again, in a pandemic space

338
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,240
that changed a lot
because now I have to say,

339
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,730
how do I know that it's you at home?

340
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,490
I do know, not Aflac, of course

341
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,480
but I do know many companies
when that happened,

342
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,200
they had the file exceptions

343
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,450
with respect to their
security controls because

344
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,500
they didn't have that sort
of resiliency in place.

345
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,600
But knowing that it's, you is important.

346
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,720
I would say from our experience,
knowing your location,

347
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,020
your location relative to our system,

348
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,090
your location relative to another person,

349
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,550
your location relative to the enterprise.

350
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,430
Those are important things as well.

351
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,420
Just quickly on that.

352
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,640
If you think about that challenge

353
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,810
of all companies have policies

354
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,469
to lock the screen after a certain amount

355
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,630
of time, again, that, to improve security,

356
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,650
we're posing it in position on the worker,

357
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,030
on the teammate.

358
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,770
What you could do is take some

359
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,379
of these things like activity.

360
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,400
I just stood up and took three steps away.

361
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,290
Location, that's the way
there's a distance there.

362
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,359
You could infer from
that, that myself or Tim,

363
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,990
we just stood up and walked
away from our attorney.

364
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,849
You might lock that terminal.

365
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,109
And otherwise, if you know that I'm there,

366
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,219
you don't have to lock the terminal.

367
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,156
It's not a matter of the timeline.

368
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,310
And so there's no friction for the user

369
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,359
and it's actually a much
more appropriate controlling.

370
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,870
Going forward, if you think
about the extensibility

371
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,030
of this platform beyond the CISO's office,

372
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,090
you might think about
health and safety as well.

373
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,330
So, you can think about temperature

374
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,639
and vital signs that
can lead you to things.

375
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,690
Even for knowledge
workers, financial services

376
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,640
what have you, or
manufacturing worker fatigue.

377
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,100
On a manufacturing line
there are injuries,

378
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,560
but in for knowledge
workers, there are mistakes.

379
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,290
So if you could pick up on
a workers getting fatigued

380
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,139
and not off, maybe give them a little bump

381
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,973
that could be helpful.

382
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,399
And then finally, 2-way
communication with the worker.

383
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,567
Those are what we think about

384
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,840
as the basic services you wanna provide.

385
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,280
And as you'll see, when
we come back to it,

386
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,500
when you start to put those
together, like standing

387
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,270
up and walking away and distance,

388
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,943
that actually performs,
improves the security control.

389
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,410
So, always know always security

390
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,890
and privacy and a very
nasty user experience.

391
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,600
Those are the things you're
gonna have to focus on.

392
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,197
Otherwise the users won't adopt them.

393
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:30,200
CISO will reject them

394
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,590
but the users won't adopt them

395
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,903
if it's not a very clean,
simple experience, next Tim.

396
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,690
So this is the, just one example in COVID.

397
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,700
We also talked a bit about,

398
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,277
just a different event like

399
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:51,120
the freezing in Texas puts a
definitive position on people.

400
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,370
But if you have those tenets in place.

401
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,669
Identity, I know that it's
you, location, activity

402
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,710
what have you, then you can start to build

403
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,350
up some solution so you can solve problems

404
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,490
like social distancing, contact tracing.

405
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,920
But also I know that it's you

406
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,190
that did this attestation,

407
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,500
say that I feel well today before

408
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,333
I come in the office, it's gonna be

409
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,870
like such a summer from COVID

410
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,808
or I'm working from home.

411
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,410
It's at the edge of the network.

412
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,390
So, when you start to,

413
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,830
or I want to come into the office,

414
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,470
but I am healthy, I'm not
running a temperature.

415
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,190
So, you start to combine
these things together.

416
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,890
And, I think Tim will
give the specific example

417
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,400
of the things we're doing at Aflac.

418
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,610
Then you'll see how

419
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,520
these different components provide

420
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,850
almost a one plus one equals three,

421
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,550
a better solution for different use cases

422
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,950
whether they're security
use cases or otherwise.

423
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,040
- So when we kind of start talking about,

424
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,470
when we started talking about,

425
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,970
I should say using a wearable device

426
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,980
to start accomplishing this,

427
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,810
we really kind of reverse our way into it.

428
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,350
It's like what is the problem
we're trying to solve?

429
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,899
The immediate problem that we're trying

430
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,110
to solve, obviously in a COVID environment

431
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,600
was how do we bring our workforce back

432
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:10,019
into the campus safely?

433
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,980
And then kind of looking

434
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,310
at it from a perspective

435
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,629
of what other benefits

436
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,120
we could derive from that.

437
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,639
So, I'm gonna go ahead
and just bring this up

438
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,390
and kind of talk about it as one picture.

439
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,210
Although they seem like discrete events.

440
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,210
Our number one use case
actually turned out

441
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,370
to be the contact
tracing, but through that,

442
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,720
we were able to accomplish
some other things.

443
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,830
And so when we talk about bringing

444
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,250
the worker back on campus, right now,

445
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,772
we have a limited number
of people coming back

446
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,740
on campus or never did leave.

447
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,900
Some essential workers
that couldn't do their job

448
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,180
off of campus.

449
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,140
The process is that they come

450
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,970
to a control point, a
physical security guard

451
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,970
uses a temperature checker
to check their temperature.

452
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,040
They have a self attestation

453
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,020
that they do about their health.

454
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,020
And then from that, they're
admitted into the building.

455
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,790
Once they're in the
building, we really don't

456
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,990
have any contact with them
from a logical standpoint.

457
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,920
So, as we were looking
at the wearable device,

458
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,270
we were looking at it from, well, one,

459
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,639
how can we solve that problem two,

460
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,170
the fact that we, once they're

461
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,720
in the building, we don't know.

462
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,370
And then how can we more
systemically, obviously

463
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,290
when we're talking about
bringing the thousands back on,

464
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,090
we're not going to have a
guard, take their temperature.

465
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,200
You can imagine the long lines,

466
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,050
the queues that would

467
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,743
be building up behind there.

468
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,159
We can do the self attestation

469
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,410
but the self attestation,
again, as they point in time

470
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,800
and would not necessarily
detect deviations.

471
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,590
So, as we looked at the wearables,

472
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,389
it started solving
several of our problems.

473
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,620
One, physical access into the building.

474
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,050
The wearable can detect some signs,

475
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,990
some symptoms, if you will

476
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,870
of maybe someone being ill,

477
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,679
and we can deny access

478
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,283
if it triggers on that.

479
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,150
We can, again, use it so that

480
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,210
when someone's in the building already,

481
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,290
had checked through, if
something occurs, for instance,

482
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,649
we see some other physiological event

483
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,850
with the individual, we can detect that.

484
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,289
The contact tracing,

485
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:04,930
if two workers get in proximity of others,

486
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,241
we can notify you within that zone,

487
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:13,241
that too close zone, but also
record that contact so that

488
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,490
if later someone else has a symptom,

489
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,283
then we can take care of that as well.

490
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,169
What we can do in building out

491
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,580
the bigger picture also

492
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,580
is it really starts creating a lifecycle.

493
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,450
For instance, in our buildings,

494
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,450
we have multifactor
authentication in normal time.

495
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,400
So you badge in, and
then you punch in a code.

496
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,420
Well, obviously during COVID,

497
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,760
we don't want people touching the key pad.

498
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,997
So, we turned that off.

499
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,820
But with this capability,
we can actually use

500
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,820
the wearable device to
take biometric signature

501
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,379
and to detect, like I said,

502
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,430
they're okay to go in.

503
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,020
We can allow them to go in

504
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,320
and it provides that multifactor
authentication inherently.

505
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,810
We can also look at, once

506
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,060
we have that, we've been able to use that

507
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,919
to start making the
employee's life better too,

508
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,730
through the ability to
log on to your computer

509
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,750
as Sullivan pointed out.

510
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,470
We had, again, part of our paperless drive

511
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,040
was that we put a secure print capability.

512
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,090
And so people would really have to think,

513
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,260
do I want to get up and
authenticate to the printer?

514
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,610
And that gave us capability to also track

515
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,325
who was using printers
most so that we could look

516
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:55,500
at workflows that could
help those people, not,

517
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,020
we weren't trying to trap them,

518
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,963
we were trying to help them.

519
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,149
We also, in our facilities,

520
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,060
we have vending machines,
technology vending machines.

521
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,750
So, those little things that a mouse

522
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,490
or whatever, that people just employees

523
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,460
they can go to this vending
machine and self service.

524
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,120
So, by having this wearable,

525
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,800
it starts giving us all
of these capabilities

526
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,399
in order to one, keep the employees safe,

527
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,040
keep our security or logical security safe

528
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,840
through a seamless,
transparent multifactor

529
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,713
but also make the employees life better.

530
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,673
- So just talk on that Tim.

531
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,580
So, there's a couple

532
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,413
of overlay use cases
that you talked about.

533
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:47,023
That one is social distance
and contact tracing.

534
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,363
Two is, use of unified security across,

535
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,470
vending machines, secure printing,

536
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,520
physical access, logical access.

537
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,320
And it's all the same user experience,

538
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,350
but then they might not seem to intersect,

539
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,810
but where you either

540
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,490
haven't had a valid
attestation which says,

541
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,780
I feel well today, I
haven't touched someone

542
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,613
with someone COVID

543
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:12,260
or you have an elevated temperature,

544
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,480
that's where having physical access,

545
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,560
joining an extra point, allows us

546
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,960
to keep you from getting in the building

547
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,871
without having security
guards at every door.

548
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:28,970
So my expectation is that

549
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,730
we'll have a significant impact on your,

550
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,190
just your normal operations.

551
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,470
I mean, normally, how
many doors you have access

552
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,680
to but you wouldn't wanna

553
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,160
have a physical security guard

554
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,550
at every door for the (mumbles)

555
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,820
- Well, and that's a
very good point Sullivan.

556
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,500
Because right now, we're having

557
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,580
to funnel all people into one entry point

558
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,919
so to speak, because that's
where the guard is, right?

559
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,770
With this capability, we're able

560
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,639
to open back up those multiple doors.

561
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,810
One facility may have eight entry points.

562
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,669
The one I work in

563
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,630
has eight entry points right
now that's funneled to one.

564
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,310
Well, as we bring people back

565
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,673
on campus, in this quasi
post COVID environment,

566
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,060
we can't have 2000 people

567
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,240
in the morning trying to
get through that one door.

568
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,343
So, this gives us the capability
to open back up as well.

569
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:24,903
(mumbles)

570
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,980
So, (laughs) go ahead.

571
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,813
- I was just gonna say the other thing

572
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:34,088
that previous slide points out is that

573
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:37,120
there's just so many things
we're asking the user

574
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,040
to keep track of in
that world where we say,

575
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,379
we're gonna build all these solutions

576
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,950
and impose them on the
worker, rather than saying

577
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,310
we're gonna take a worker centric solution

578
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,490
and figuring out how to connect

579
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,240
to all these different ways.

580
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,680
So, it's a different way to
shake the tree, if you will,

581
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,430
but you take away a lot
of complexity, that's so.

582
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,170
- Yeah, and I mean, I'm
not gonna obviously read

583
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,740
this to the audience, it's been up here.

584
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,290
They can read this, but the user,

585
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,320
when we first started talking

586
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,610
about putting a wearable on a user,

587
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,760
we had some concerns, there
were privacy concerns,

588
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,390
there were, are these people tracking me,

589
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,498
those kinds of things.

590
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:20,000
But it was very legitimate.

591
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,380
I'm not making lie of that.

592
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,010
But as we ran this
through a pilot group of,

593
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,780
I don't known about 80 or 100 people,

594
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,000
what they found out is it really
does make your life easier.

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,560
I mean it enables you to do things

596
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,980
the, not remember, having to remember

597
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,430
to lock your keyboard.

598
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,050
When you go to your
computer, having it log you

599
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,919
in based on your biometric
signature, the ability

600
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,510
for us to make sure it's secure,

601
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,435
because one of the first things

602
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:51,173
that popped up is, oh, well

603
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:52,960
I just gave my band to someone else.

604
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,900
Well, no, it doesn't work that way.

605
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,060
If it's not you, it doesn't work.

606
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,409
So, it's not like a badge

607
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,370
where you can give it to someone

608
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,439
and they can use it to
get into the building.

609
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,550
Or in some of our penetration tests,

610
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,550
we had seen where, our penetrators,

611
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,449
or testers were able
to duplicate the badge.

612
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,567
That's one of the reasons
we went to multifactor.

613
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,010
So, it solves all of this

614
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,950
in a way that's not
burdensome to the employee.

615
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,210
And anytime security can make
life better for an employee.

616
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,783
I think that's an advantage.

617
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,020
And then, across the team.

618
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,020
So, again, in the security
realm, we often do things

619
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,540
and the rest of the company looks, oh,

620
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,040
those crazy security guys

621
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,340
they're requiring this, but in this case,

622
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,010
we've been able to
solve multiple problems.

623
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,160
And even our app development team

624
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,130
is a little bit excited about this

625
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,300
because some of the things
that they've had to go through

626
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,389
for access controls that
obviously we impose,

627
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,333
we can do that through transparent access,

628
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
through the, the band, the wearable,

629
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,410
the authentication knowing that

630
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,490
who it is not having to go

631
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,773
through other steps to do that.

632
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,550
Privacy was a big issue
again, we've solved that.

633
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,100
I mean the wearable accommodates privacy,

634
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,230
there's all kinds of options, depending

635
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,180
on even local privacy rules,
if you need to do that.

636
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,330
So, I think it's one

637
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,639
of those situations where

638
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,630
it's just a really good solution

639
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,760
that we're able to accommodate a lot

640
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,803
of different people's interests.

641
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,153
- If I may Tim.

642
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:51,810
I mean, we could go around the wheel.

643
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,475
HR is that uniform,

644
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:55,669
it's a uniform experience for everybody,

645
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,503
your health and safety, what have you.

646
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:59,389
Another one that's been really interesting

647
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,700
for us is digital transformation.

648
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,110
So, today, first of all,

649
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,050
if you're going to do this,

650
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,870
to get to this connected work approach,

651
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,979
then you really need to
think hard about privacy.

652
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,010
And we'd certainly advocate you look

653
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,730
at privacy by design comes out

654
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,600
of the entire government,
but it's the basis for GDPR.

655
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,250
Basis for the California privacy act

656
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,120
that make things transparent to the user

657
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,620
and give them the option up in and out,

658
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,260
give him the right to begin, et cetera.

659
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,340
So, you look at that as sort

660
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,620
of design principles for
privacy, if you could provide

661
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,330
that privacy layer about
what the worker's doing,

662
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,990
then you give a really unique opportunity

663
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,260
to digital transformation people.

664
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,510
They might want to know
what the workers are doing.

665
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,960
They may or may not have the
rights to know that, right.

666
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,570
But if you implement this
privacy layer correctly,

667
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,850
so it's not just a security layer.

668
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,053
And especially for national
companies, you can say

669
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,783
like in the US, do I have
the rights to this data?

670
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,330
In Germany, do I have
the rights to this data?

671
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,297
And what kind of data and on basis

672
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:58,090
of any individual, it
really changes things.

673
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,649
So, today what you would
normally do, a DX initiative

674
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,060
of digital transformation so
you don't move on and say,

675
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,270
I wanna collect data about the workers.

676
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,870
I'm gonna go out to when
they are badging in,

677
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,729
when they are tapping this

678
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,790
on this system, what have you.

679
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,370
Then you'd have to bring it
back to a data lake curated,

680
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,659
make sure the clocks are synchronized

681
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,410
so you don't hope for the wrong things.

682
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,450
But then you have to ask the question,

683
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,610
do I have the rights to even look into

684
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,979
it and see that data, right?

685
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,690
If you implement this
correctly, essentially

686
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,490
you have a virtualized data
lake it's completely curated

687
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,030
for you, of the data about
the worker's current.

688
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,480
And, you know, if you have
the rights to use it or not.

689
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,920
So, a DX person doesn't have to go out

690
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,610
and collect all this information.

691
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,850
They can just sit in their cube

692
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,409
or at home today, what
have you, and go ahead.

693
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,380
So, that's one example

694
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,997
but you could go all around the wheel.

695
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:42,690
(mumbles)

696
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,480
- And as Sullivan offered
some of the examples

697
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,140
of what it does is again, it contributes

698
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,550
to our resiliency because
there's so many things

699
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,280
that we can do with the data now.

700
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,670
I mean, if we wanted to, I could track,

701
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,520
this is an employee that badged

702
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,850
into this building with their wearable,

703
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,023
they walked right in,

704
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,860
these are the points they
went into the building, right?

705
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,610
So, if employee were infected,

706
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,830
we could know where they were

707
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,100
but also we could tell when they badge

708
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,840
in and they went to their computer,

709
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,169
so we could put that person

710
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,520
in the place of their
computer, which again,

711
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,353
we can use that

712
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:30,410
as part of our authentication
authorization mechanisms

713
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,970
and detect if someone is trying to log

714
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,030
in as that person, but they're not there.

715
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,713
So, that gives us just more
capability around that.

716
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,220
Sullivan, I'm gonna ask you to go ahead

717
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,352
and just wrap us up here.

718
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:49,380
- Sure, so I guess formatically,

719
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,650
what we're advocating here

720
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,300
is that you just take a unified approach

721
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,270
to connect in the work.

722
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,480
You think about security,

723
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,997
you think about privacy, you
think about that free access.

724
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,885
And started a primary objective for that

725
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:05,860
or necessary functionality
or layers to that.

726
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,899
And then you could do other things

727
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,219
like location and health
and safety, what have you.

728
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,366
When you think about that,

729
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,909
when you think about, say

730
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,319
the work at Aflac, when you solve

731
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,380
the problem once for many
different applications,

732
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,210
you're allowed to do that better.

733
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,070
So Tim, I might ask the level
of security that we will have

734
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,070
for an individual at
Aflac is probably higher

735
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,110
than for any access to any
of the systems applications

736
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,929
or in terms of identifying

737
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,759
and ensuring that it's done.

738
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,010
Any applications or doors or anything

739
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,969
is, will be higher when we
finish this, will be higher

740
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:45,359
than it was for anything prior to that.

741
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,830
Now there's other controls in place

742
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,940
like privilege access management

743
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,409
in terms of (mumbles) that,

744
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,850
is that a fair statement?

745
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,203
- Yeah, it is.

746
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,080
It's not only making that assertion

747
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,720
but being to validate that
assertion electronically

748
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,200
which is always important,

749
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,839
it gets back to our
concept of defensibility.

750
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
I may have a control

751
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,490
but can I really prove
that that control works?

752
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,223
And this gives us, on so many levels,

753
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,319
the defensibility there.

754
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,010
- Yeah, so I would say, I mean,

755
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,600
so you can provide much better privacy,

756
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,720
much better security

757
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,899
or really much less effort.

758
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,610
And then by separating those things,

759
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,540
having, by separating the worker

760
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,630
from all these back end systems,

761
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,030
you also have more agility.

762
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,480
You can make changes under the covers

763
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,140
the user doesn't even see it.

764
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,509
So, that actually sets
you up for resiliency.

765
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,590
So certainly that's what we're advocating.

766
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,450
In the first steps you might think about,

767
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,560
should I really be going down this course?

768
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,110
In the second step, if
I do go down the course,

769
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,570
what kind of business
case can I make for that?

770
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,020
Can I retire badges?

771
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,413
Can I get rid of passwords finally?

772
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,710
Can I get rid of additional firms

773
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,392
for multifactor and all
the complexity behind that?

774
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,250
You're starting to think
about the business case

775
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,527
put that together and then execute it.

776
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,870
So, that those would be I think

777
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,150
the key takeaways and next steps.

778
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,130
- Okay, well, that kind of wraps us up.

779
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,000
And I, again, we thank you so much

780
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,380
for the opportunity to speak.

781
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,780
This is a use case that
we have found valuable

782
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,721
and certainly on LinkedIn,

783
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:22,507
if anybody wants to reach out, thank you.

784
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,257
- Thanks, Tim
