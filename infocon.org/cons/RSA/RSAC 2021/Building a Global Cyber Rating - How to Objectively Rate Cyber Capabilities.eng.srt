00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,920
- Hello, I'm Jack Freund and I'm the Head

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,850
of Cyber Risk Methodology
for Visible Risks,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,949
I have been doing Cyber
Risk Quantification

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,070
for going on 15 years.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,670
And this presentation is gonna talk

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,710
a little bit about how we
have been thinking about

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,960
taking some of that CRQ stuff

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,073
and moving it into a Global Cyber Rating.

9
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:23,320
And Derek is my co-presenter here today,

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,830
and he's going to introduce himself.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,500
- Thanks Jack, I'm Derek Vadala,

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,030
the co-founder and CEO of VisibleRisk

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,210
which is a joint venture

14
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,050
between Moody's Corporation and Team8.

15
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,890
And I'd like to really kick us off

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,920
by talking a bit about the idea that

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,650
we need a Global Rating Scale,

18
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,070
and we need a global way to rate companies

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,430
from a cybersecurity perspective.

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,700
I think this really
stems from the idea that

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,630
it's difficult to get a comprehensive

22
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,340
view of cybersecurity risks,

23
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,100
something that brings together

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,050
various aspects of both
the technical controls

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,779
as well as the risk management
side of cybersecurity.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,288
And do that in a way that is consistent,

27
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,862
establishes pure benchmarking,

28
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:11,190
really integrates financial exposure

29
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,399
and measurement of, you know?

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,450
What are the adverse financial effects

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,300
of a of a cyber event.

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,270
And then finally, how
do you objective measure

33
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,310
the security program
and the security leaders

34
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,460
that have responsibility for
managing risk for the company?

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,460
And being able to translate
that into language

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,990
that's digestible and understandable

37
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,479
by non-technical executives
and board directors,

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,150
I think is one of the
other compelling reasons

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,470
why the timing is right
to really establish

40
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,083
something like this as
a marketplace, Jack.

41
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,370
- And it's not that there hasn't been

42
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,200
solutions in these spaces before.

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,950
And indeed my own experience
with Cyber Risk Quantification

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,351
has shown that we are trying
to measure these kinds of stuff

45
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,730
but what we really need
is a blended approach.

46
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,160
And then let me talk a little bit about

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,300
each of these five areas that have been

48
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,933
working towards cyber assessments to date.

49
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,240
The first is this traditional

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,300
outside in view of cybersecurity.

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,810
These are your scanning vendors

52
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,520
looking at externally facing systems

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,853
that provide useful information
of external attack surface,

54
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,360
but gives you relatively
limited view of internal things.

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
And it also doesn't map
it to any business risks,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,100
so it's sort of missing that connection

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,200
to why certain audience members
indicated here on the center

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,850
might not particularly find this

59
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,410
a compelling assessment type.

60
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,852
A lot of companies complain
about these types of scoring

61
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:38,010
not only because there
is limited opportunity

62
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,130
to fix things that are going wrong,

63
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,859
but also because they're susceptible to

64
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,210
being obfuscated by certain kinds of way,

65
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,610
and don't have visibility in the things

66
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,660
that are meaningful to that organization.

67
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,420
One of those things that might be,

68
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,670
for example, operational technology.

69
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,950
If the company under evaluation

70
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,760
has this type of component to it,

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,040
which is a key part of
his business operations

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,670
and outside in scan
isn't gonna detect that,

73
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,250
not gonna be able to see that.

74
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,580
Indeed this quote from
Forrester here on the right

75
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,600
that just came out a few weeks ago,

76
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,890
talked a little bit about how
these platform measurements

77
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,809
tend to miss out on an
overall representation

78
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,050
of a firm's cyber risk,
is that part of it?

79
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,550
We think so, but is it the whole thing?

80
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,650
It's certainly can be.

81
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,760
Organizations have been using

82
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,670
management assessment for some time,

83
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,809
this tends to rely on
typically control frameworks

84
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,890
or risk frameworks and tries to make

85
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,089
an assessment about how
connected these things are

86
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,627
to an organization
cybersecurity practices.

87
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:38,030
It's really based on best practices

88
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,361
and certainly not a risk based approach,

89
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:43,340
but it does help organizations understand

90
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,140
the connection between a
cybersecurity program and strategy,

91
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,420
and where these things are
measured and put into place.

92
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,088
Oftentimes these maturity
based views are used by CISOs

93
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:55,760
when they communicate to their boards

94
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
indicate where they
were and where they are

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,052
to show progress towards a goal.

96
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:02,750
Again, this is an element
of an overall cyber rating

97
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,750
but it's missing the completeness
of a Global Cyber Scale.

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,020
Complementary to an outside in
score is the inside out score

99
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,530
you certainly get much better perspective

100
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,620
on the control posture from
the inside of the organization.

101
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,600
Now, there is a wide variety
of approaches to this

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,890
and tools including scanning vendors

103
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,590
that can provide these types of things.

104
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,020
It tends to be highly
technical which requires deep

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,890
and heavy translations for executives

106
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,229
to be able to understand them.

107
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,462
So the audience is very limited
for these types of things

108
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:39,039
and oftentimes even so because
of the wealth of information

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,716
available about the technical controls,

110
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,110
it tends to not have that connection

111
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,190
back to the the business context,

112
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,630
and the business risk of an organization

113
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,283
without some sort of
translation layer in between.

114
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,170
Well, it could also apply
probabilistic data models

115
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,260
to this type of solution here.

116
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,420
A lot of insurance
companies and underwriters

117
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,774
will use this type of
approach to sort of understand

118
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:06,430
what probable loss looks
like for an organization

119
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,490
and in so doing, you get very
useful statistical projections

120
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,930
of what we think loss could
look like for an organization.

121
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,940
This is helpful.

122
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,810
It does require significant
amounts of data.

123
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,000
That's sometimes difficult

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,201
for organizations to compile internally,

125
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,390
and it also requires a significant

126
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,190
amount of translation
as well for executives

127
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,100
to quite understand them.

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,689
Although typical targets
this tend to include CROs,

129
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,230
credit analysts also find this stuff

130
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,970
very, very useful as well.

131
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,170
And because this is sort of an end state

132
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,200
assessment of what risk looks like,

133
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,840
it doesn't necessarily
have a detailed views

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,599
into what controls look like,

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,210
or at the very least
it's baked in already,

136
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,140
and there's very little
room for adjustment

137
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,690
to what those scores look like.

138
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,940
What I was gonna talk about is

139
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,540
the scenario based stress
testing and this is used in

140
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,490
especially in a lot of
financial based organizations

141
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,601
that are trying figure out

142
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,090
what their capital reserve
allocation looks like,

143
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,419
and should look like
for not just financial

144
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,760
and credit risk and market risk,

145
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,159
but also for operational risk.

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,530
And this typically includes, you know?

147
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,090
Coming up with a set of scenarios

148
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,330
or what if statements about
things that could happen,

149
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,320
and then assigning some
sort of loss to them.

150
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,630
And this way it mirrors slightly

151
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,150
the probabilistic data models,

152
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,650
but tends to focus more
on those extreme outcomes.

153
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,130
And doesn't have quite the
same ability to measure

154
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,560
in any sort of meaningful way

155
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,930
what that control looks like to that

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,230
without letting something
else attached to it.

157
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,620
So indeed again, very,
very focused on CROs

158
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,280
and credit analysts cause of the role

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,099
that it plays in working on

160
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,630
capital reserves for organizations.

161
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,230
And all five of these there's value,

162
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,680
and all five of these have weaknesses.

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,390
And the idea is that if we wanna build

164
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,570
a Global Cyber Rating we need
to have the ability to see

165
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,640
the way that all four of
these stakeholder groups see

166
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,719
an organization's cybersecurity,

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,760
so we can walk up and down
levels of decomposition

168
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,837
to get very close to what
reality looks like for them.

169
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,450
And this way we think
blending these five approaches

170
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,190
is gonna give a meaningful output

171
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,790
and into a methodology that can build

172
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,683
a Global Cyber Rating, Erick.

173
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,220
- Thanks Jack, I think
when we're considering

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,330
how to integrate these things together

175
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,041
from a global rating perspective,

176
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,860
we really think about it along
the following lines, right?

177
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,370
You have to make it holistic,

178
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,030
which is I think a lot of
what Jack just talked about,

179
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,710
and bringing together
these different areas.

180
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,640
There's different ways
of doing measurements

181
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,840
and evaluating companies,

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,119
and you have to validate that data, right?

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,690
And you have to be able
to look at the data

184
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,719
understand which of it
is relevant to the risk,

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,670
understand what the different

186
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,470
fidelity levels of that data are,

187
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,210
and then bring that
together into an independent

188
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,890
and transparent model
that is both focused on

189
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,090
providing the outcomes and the answers

190
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,190
that the stakeholders are looking for

191
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,210
but also has transparency into

192
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,789
how those calculations are done

193
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,670
and how you get from those inputs to

194
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,610
the top level rating output.

195
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,410
I think it's extremely important that

196
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,230
consumers of these
models really understand

197
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,430
how organizations go from A, to B

198
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,350
in terms of going through
that rating process

199
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,350
and coming up with an
outcome that makes sense

200
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,120
from a methodology standpoint.

201
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,930
So I think all of those things
have to be brought together,

202
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,150
and then of course having
that financial focus

203
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,480
and that peer benchmarking
built into the output,

204
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,990
I think is really something
that's absolutely necessary

205
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,480
if you're thinking about building

206
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,523
these types of systems and scales.

207
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,150
Probably worth talking a
little bit more about the data,

208
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,860
which you could you
could sort of think about

209
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,640
as an overlay to the five areas
that Jack was talking about

210
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,990
in terms what are the components
necessary to build this?

211
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,920
He talked a bit about outside in.

212
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,870
I think absolutely a component

213
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,590
of a Global Rating
Scales for cybersecurity.

214
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,700
You know, these are new and novel ways

215
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,630
of looking at an organization,

216
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,520
aggregating data from outside the company,

217
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,490
open source intelligence,
data sets scanning,

218
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,560
other threat intelligence
and really organizing that

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,930
so that it can be applied
to individual companies.

220
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,069
This can be done once you've built

221
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,320
all the platforms to do it,

222
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
and there are some successful

223
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,140
businesses out there that do this.

224
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,500
Can be done with very little effort

225
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,489
once you build the core technology,

226
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,300
but I think we all recognize that

227
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,660
the fidelity level of that type of data

228
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,819
can be very low if it's not paired

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,360
with other information about the company.

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,050
And so as we sort of build this

231
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,829
sort of way of thinking about the data,

232
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,540
the next piece is inside information,

233
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,906
and this really comes
in a couple of forms.

234
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:01,340
The first of which I think is
self attestation data, right?

235
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,040
This is data that the company already has,

236
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,719
data that it can provide
to our existing reports,

237
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,340
or data that it can provide
for things like surveys

238
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,550
or interviews, traditional
things that you would see

239
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,560
in that management assessment category

240
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,209
that Jack talked about.

241
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,230
Very useful for setting baselines,

242
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,240
very useful for understanding the scope

243
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,700
and the playing field but it
really has to be strengthened

244
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,880
both with that outside data
as a validator where possible,

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,990
and you really have to go
inside the organization

246
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,680
to validate the information

247
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,770
with direct technical testing as well.

248
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,480
I think this generally comes in two forms,

249
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,830
the first is data query.

250
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,710
By connecting to things like
APIs from security technology

251
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,990
or other IT systems and aggregating
some of that information

252
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,540
into risk metrics and signals,

253
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,849
but also doing some
empirical testing, right?

254
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,326
Being able to sort of simulate

255
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,550
adverse events in the environment

256
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,599
and then collect information
about the success

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,940
or failure of those potential events,

258
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,630
and weave that together
into the data model.

259
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,211
So I think when you have all
of these things together,

260
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:13,290
you get to a very nice blended
approach to data collection

261
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,760
that I think is paramount
to being able to establish

262
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,720
a rating scale that again can be holistic

263
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,670
and independent and transparent,

264
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,660
and really start to get
to that pure benchmarking

265
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,430
and financially focused output.

266
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,550
And Jack, we'll talk a little bit more

267
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,170
about the modeling process there

268
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,170
and how some of that financial
focus can be brought to bear.

269
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,099
- So what type of data
do we need to collect

270
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,030
at any one part of this model?

271
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,569
And that's really what I
think is really important.

272
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,100
And so they're are talking about

273
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
different types of data
that we can collect

274
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,550
but to what degree in what depth?

275
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,670
And I think it's worth
taking a brief pause here

276
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,640
to sort of talk a little bit about

277
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,790
sort of the theory of modeling generally.

278
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,690
And what you see here is sort
of a continuum of modeling

279
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,050
that you can sort of think about

280
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,410
where you wanna fall on this.

281
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,410
And it's very easy to
collect too much data

282
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,050
and this is very sort of fall
on the right hand side here

283
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,380
of over elaboration over parametrization.

284
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,030
We've collected too much data.

285
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,760
It's sort of seizes up the
system and the modeling

286
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,750
to be too complex and too difficult.

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,860
If you collect not enough data,

288
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,220
it's clearly indefensible and fictitious.

289
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,870
So the goal of good modeling
really comes down to

290
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,450
what they call a parsimonious model,

291
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,427
which is a relatively simple model

292
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:35,950
that has great predictive power.

293
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,080
So what does kind of
means is we wanna collect

294
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,470
and surface the most important signals

295
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,485
about a cybersecurity environment

296
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:47,370
that has the most ability
to predict overall

297
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,390
what we think a Global Cyber Rating

298
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,580
looks like for that company.

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,870
This is an important theoretical
stake to put in the ground

300
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,850
and sort of understand that the goal

301
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,110
was not simply to replicate
existing compliance scans

302
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,880
that exist in various forms already,

303
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,897
but the pick from all five
of those original things,

304
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:08,850
the most important things
that are really predictive

305
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,420
and really explanatory
about what an overall

306
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,089
organization's cybersecurity posture

307
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,943
and a loss potential look like.

308
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,630
So when you think about
doing modeling this way

309
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,950
I built these next few
slides to talk about

310
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,260
sort of a hierarchy of
how I think about it.

311
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,520
And at the top here of
what will be a pyramid here

312
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,430
in a few slides is this
general methodology.

313
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,459
And this sort of provides
a contextual framework

314
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,450
for everything else that we're doing.

315
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,220
And this is really where that
top rating is going to exist,

316
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
and we'll reveal that in a few slides.

317
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,250
But you'll see at the top here,

318
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,000
the sort of scale of good to bad

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,780
and where everything's sort of fits

320
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,880
that we've rolled up from the very bottom.

321
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,699
The next layer down I call rubrics

322
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,050
and all the important areas that we think

323
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,699
comprise cybersecurity
operational environment

324
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,810
are going to have metrics in here

325
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,800
just to measure and represent them

326
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,560
in terms of the overall methodology.

327
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,109
So these are sort of a
big picture containers

328
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,130
for all the details that are below.

329
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,460
And indeed those details are scores,

330
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,323
coming to different forms.

331
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,290
There's this raw score,

332
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,860
which is literally just a piece of data

333
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,750
that was collected about an environment

334
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,780
such as the number of
domain admins that exists.

335
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,720
And then the scale score above it,

336
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,700
contextualizes that with
some sort of denominator,

337
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,360
for example, the number of domain admins

338
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,530
relative to all admins or all users

339
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,240
in a particular organization.

340
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,738
And that's where this signaling comes in

341
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:38,150
and becomes very important
is to what degree

342
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,709
are those elements at
the bottom indicative

343
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,120
of the overall piece of that
rubric that we're measuring,

344
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,410
and then to what degree should that

345
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,689
play in the overall methodology

346
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,610
that comprises the score
that we're coming up with?

347
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,600
And indeed, it's important to wrap

348
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700
a process around this too,

349
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,980
and what we really want is for
that high level piece there

350
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,220
to be relatively static
over a long period of time

351
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,010
with changes in the rubric happening

352
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,930
a little more frequently.

353
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,870
And then at the very bottom,

354
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,000
those pieces adjusting to the nature

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,500
of the technological
environments as they advance.

356
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,710
So you'll see more change
at the bottom than the top

357
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,829
and this creates a certain
amount of consistency

358
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,540
for interpretation for
the core audiences that

359
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,199
we're thinking about in that
stakeholder listing earlier.

360
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,830
All of these are models and we sort of try

361
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,470
and piece these things together
in a way that is meaningful

362
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,843
and it has a lot of
rigor associated to it.

363
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,100
Part of that rigor comes from the way

364
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,690
that we're decomposing this modeling

365
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,360
down from top to bottom,

366
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,407
and that's where I think we
should sort of start here.

367
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,290
And this flow chart there on the left is,

368
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,920
think about which element
we're trying to put together

369
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,849
and put into place.

370
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,655
Think about what the input formula output,

371
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,740
that basic information system
processing piece happens.

372
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,920
We're going to take this piece of data,

373
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,089
we're gonna apply some
sort of transform to it,

374
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,810
and the output is gonna
say something meaningful

375
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,729
about this particular area.

376
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,910
And we have to rationalize
why that score exists

377
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,270
and then sort of justify it.

378
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,670
And I like this meme on the right there,

379
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,069
it makes me laugh every time I look at it,

380
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,470
but it sort of talks a little bit about

381
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,760
different ways to measure temperature.

382
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,360
And I like to sort of draw parallels

383
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,650
between this and the cybersecurity.

384
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,560
Plenty of ways to measure

385
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,727
different elements of cybersecurity,

386
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,209
but we really want are the ones

387
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,430
that are the most meaningful
for the context that we're...

388
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,406
For the context in which
we're placing them.

389
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:25,410
And so sure Kelvin is a very
absolute sort of scale for that

390
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,240
but not very useful for providing

391
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,050
meaningful information
about how COVID is outside.

392
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,780
So for all of these things
that we're trying to do,

393
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,280
it's important to think about the reality

394
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
that we're trying to
model at the very end,

395
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,949
and then progress down from there.

396
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,490
So if we think about something
like threat, for example,

397
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,490
and we're really worried
about what a if the,

398
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,480
or relations threat posture looks like.

399
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,727
if it's sort of decompose and say,

400
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,949
"Well, when you say threat,
what do you really mean?"

401
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,790
And then the answers to those questions

402
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,920
become the next layer down on the model.

403
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,140
And then you can get these

404
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,840
get down to these atomic
elements, these raw score pieces

405
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,363
that allow you to roll these things up.

406
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,100
For places where there's
an existing model,

407
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
and you're trying to build
these kinds of things,

408
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,740
it's important to leverage
those where it makes sense

409
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,020
and to contextualize them in the overall

410
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,683
methodological framework
that you're putting together.

411
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:13,510
And at all times it's
important to keep in mind that

412
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,760
it's a difference between asserting

413
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,050
that you think something
is indicative of reality

414
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,629
and being able to test it
and show proof of that.

415
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,599
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in a second,

416
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,149
but the ideas of, you know?

417
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,470
How predictive a
particular control piece is

418
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,860
to the overall model is
very, very important.

419
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,610
Now, something called backtesting exists,

420
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,560
where you look at the outcomes
and you go back and say,

421
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,730
I predicted that this piece
was gonna be indicative,

422
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,033
and here's an actual outcome.

423
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:42,372
How close to truth was I in that?

424
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:45,110
And that forms part of the care

425
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,419
and feeding of any sort of model

426
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,078
to keep it relevant and up-to-date,

427
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:50,780
and highly rigorous and indicative

428
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,423
of true reality in that way.

429
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,090
Part of that requires
wrapping process around it,

430
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,350
and for anybody who's familiar

431
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,500
with something called
model risk management,

432
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,420
this is sort of the
approach that they take.

433
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,830
It's a very meta-approach
to risk management.

434
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,149
In other words, what's the risk

435
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,160
that your risk model is wrong,

436
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,790
and how do you manage that?

437
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,100
So really this comes down to a sort of

438
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,159
understanding and documenting
things very, very well.

439
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,300
What's the model, what's it
there for, why we're using it?

440
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,399
And then decomposing it down through

441
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,010
all of our documentation assumptions,

442
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,670
and I'll tell you one key giveaway

443
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,510
that you have not really documented

444
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,340
and worked on the rigor of your model

445
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,439
is not identifying what
the assumptions are.

446
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,590
All models that have assumptions,

447
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,370
so calling them out
justifying why they exist

448
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,090
and trying to correct for
them is really very important.

449
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,750
And then you have to apply
control to the model,

450
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,891
make sure that as you're
putting it into production

451
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,780
and applying it that
you're managing its output

452
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,260
to make sure that it's relevant.

453
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,520
And then what do you do over time

454
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,620
and sort of wrapping an
evergreen process around it

455
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,429
to make sure that you have
change control for the model,

456
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,140
that the intention and use
of the model, has it shifted?

457
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,610
And do we need to go back and
adjust the foundation of that

458
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,169
to ensure that the outcome
still meets the needs of it?

459
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,330
So all these pieces are
important for making sure that

460
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,163
a model has validity and
value in the marketplace.

461
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,900
- So let's zoom out for a bit
and think about, you know?

462
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,610
Once you've gone through this
process of thinking about

463
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,959
what the model ought to look like

464
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,900
and what some of those underlying scores

465
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,610
and measurements should be,

466
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,649
what is the top level
of that scale look like?

467
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,880
And what are some ways to think about it?

468
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,470
I think, when you look at, you know?

469
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,470
Existing scales for scoring
technology or cybersecurity

470
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,200
you tend to see things in the marketplace

471
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,620
that follow up pretty
typical kind of school grade

472
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,080
type approach, zero to 100, or A through F

473
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,439
or sometimes you see the kind of

474
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,680
consumer credit oriented view.

475
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,900
I think one of the
challenges with these types

476
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,784
of scoring mechanisms at the top level is

477
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:53,450
it offers some false precision.

478
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,720
I think in a lot of cases,

479
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,520
but I think it also implies that

480
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,889
there's an absolute
sort of scoring to them

481
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,560
when really it's a relative scale that

482
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,780
most of these systems
have at the top level.

483
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,800
And I think that's the type of system

484
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,220
that you want at the top level.

485
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,410
You wanna see that ordinal
benchmark between organizations

486
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,128
and you wanna have just
enough positions on that scale

487
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:20,659
to have meaningful differentiation

488
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,665
and meaningful categorization,

489
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:25,170
but not have it be so deep that

490
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,820
you get into this false precision issue.

491
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,040
So when we think about
this, we think, you know?

492
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,490
A simple eight notch scale thinking about

493
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,586
CR One with a cyber risk leader,

494
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,810
and then moving down the
scale to something like

495
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,409
an eight point position which
would be the lagging bucket.

496
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,490
I think this is relatable
to that executive audience

497
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,430
that we talked before
because it does follow

498
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,730
what's done in other
business areas like credit

499
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,523
or the new and emerging ESG
style ratings and assessments.

500
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:58,743
And so it's, I think helpful
to think about it this way.

501
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:02,200
Doesn't mean you can't
have absolute scoring

502
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,960
that sits underneath this
ordinal scale at the top.

503
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,760
In fact, I think that type of
absolute scoring at the top...

504
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,706
At the lower levels is quite important.

505
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,330
And there are some areas that

506
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,957
you might wanna measure in that way

507
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,410
and even compare and contrast

508
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,040
and you might pull those
out of the full rating model

509
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,950
to offer some standalone insights.

510
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,210
But I think at the top level,

511
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,280
you really wanna see
this ordinal benchmarking

512
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,610
in order to really
understand how organizations

513
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,939
that are going through the process

514
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,200
are performing relative to each other.

515
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
So I think Jack's gonna
talk a little bit more about

516
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,320
how to go a little bit deeper on this

517
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,044
and think about blending
some of those other areas

518
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,830
in a way that can make a
scale like this meaningful

519
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,130
- Thanks Derek, so these eight categories,

520
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,200
these eight notch tail we think

521
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,830
represents that top cyber rating.

522
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,270
We think that's where that
methodology role happens.

523
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,370
Underneath that at that
rubric level of the model,

524
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,520
we think these four areas are

525
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,970
the ones that need to be measured

526
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,870
and have representation
in that overall score.

527
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,870
Threat, governance, fortitude, and risk.

528
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,246
We have a pension for short terms,

529
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:10,140
and we think that sort of encapsulate

530
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,920
those things very, very well.

531
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,580
I'm gonna deep dive into threat and risk

532
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,413
in the following slides.

533
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,530
Let me talk a little bit about
governance and fortitude.

534
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,830
Now these are sort of the areas that

535
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,449
you would expect them to
be representative of...

536
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,460
Sorry, governance at
least is representative

537
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,000
of that sort of soft cultural elements

538
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,150
of an organization's practices, you know?

539
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,010
How you manage awareness
and where those things

540
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,180
sort of fit in the organization.

541
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,960
How often are you briefing the board?

542
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,970
Fortitude represents a relatively

543
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,100
common view of security controls,

544
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,030
keeping in mind some of the modeling rigor

545
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,500
that we wanna wrap around that.

546
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
The other two, I think really sort of

547
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,200
help us to decompose a little bit deeper

548
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,250
and I'll talk about that in a second.

549
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,820
But the idea is that each
of these four pillars

550
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,439
offers some insight for
different stakeholders,

551
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,240
understanding that of all the stakeholders

552
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,500
that we're thinking about,

553
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,663
there's an aggregate view of this

554
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,230
that that goes all the way up

555
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,731
and as representative of the entirety

556
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,980
of the thing that we're modeling here.

557
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,490
But the idea is that
what we really want is

558
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,760
views of each of these
verticals to provide

559
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,720
meaningful insight to
some of our stakeholders

560
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
that they can take action on
and they can control them.

561
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,490
In many cases, cybersecurity
is a responsibility

562
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,590
of several different
verticals in an organization,

563
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,120
and in some cases that those verticals

564
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,530
have variable influence on the other.

565
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,700
So we kind of wanna be able to measure

566
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,150
those things very, very well.

567
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,830
So decomposing two of these rubrics

568
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,230
down under threat and risk,

569
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,540
this is sort of the area
that we're thinking about

570
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,010
in terms of building measurements
underneath these things,

571
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,050
and I'll start on the
left here with a threat.

572
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,960
We think there's three big
elements underneath here

573
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,710
that look like attack vectors,

574
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,690
threat activity, and data lakes.

575
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,360
And this can cover a myriad of things

576
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,780
and I've listed several
of them underneath there,

577
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,810
sort of a view of what does
the activity level look like

578
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,149
of an organization out on the dark web,

579
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,727
and the things that
are being talked about?

580
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,150
And in some ways, these
are relatively immutable.

581
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,180
You can't control who is
thinking about attacking you

582
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,990
but in other ways it's
sort of a measurement

583
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,540
of the neighborhood that you live in.

584
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,990
If you live in a bad neighborhoods,

585
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,400
sometimes bad things happen.

586
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,260
And that's an important thing to reflect

587
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,733
in overall score of this kind of way.

588
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,040
On the risk side, we think there's a role

589
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,620
for a traditional cyber
risk quantification in here,

590
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,040
but you have to provide
a meaningful benchmark.

591
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,409
We think coming up with a
materiality benchmark to that

592
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,180
helps us solve that problem.

593
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,550
And that gives us the
opportunity to look at

594
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,700
what an extreme event would
look like for an organization,

595
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,990
and then also measure using insurance

596
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,940
and other capital reserve measures,

597
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,900
what an extreme event looks like

598
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,340
at the tail end of that curve.

599
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,159
So if you had a very, very bad day,

600
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,490
and we had to dip into reserves
and make insurance claims,

601
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,840
how material would that event kind of be?

602
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,919
And then at the very end it's
important to understand too,

603
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,040
that the frequency with
which these events happen

604
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,510
is also very very meaningful

605
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,510
and relative within the particular
grouping of organizations

606
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,220
We think there's a
large role for scenarios

607
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,008
and coming up with some of the scoring,

608
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:16,660
and I think one of the things that I find

609
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,340
to be most helpful is a decomposition

610
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,070
down from big picture things
down to granular things.

611
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,300
So on the left-hand side here,

612
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,710
what you'll see on the
left on the top there

613
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,590
are the three big categories that we think

614
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,530
the scenario is sort of group under.

615
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,450
Your traditional business
interruptions type of events,

616
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,880
data disclosure and then fraud.

617
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,190
Decomposing these down,

618
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,550
I'm a big fan of the Basel
II Framework for doing this.

619
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,570
Help organizations categorize
what these losses look like,

620
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,770
and then at the very bottom
attaching something like

621
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,713
a MITRE Att&CK Framework
to that to be able to say

622
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,300
that we have attached
to these granular things

623
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,379
that organizations care
about at that security level,

624
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,090
all the way up to that business
connection at the very top

625
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,919
or where people who are
not technology savvy

626
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,753
can look at something and say,

627
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,840
"I understand what
business interruption is.

628
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,477
I've heard of ransomware,

629
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,930
or I don't know how to know
what firmware compromise is,

630
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,600
but I get that these things are connected

631
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,129
and we can sort of make a representation

632
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,030
about those things at the very top level.

633
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,237
So this is an important way to think about

634
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,908
and especially some of that scoring

635
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,810
and also attaching those control tests

636
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,500
and those cultural evaluations

637
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,480
and the threat pieces that altogether.

638
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,623
So we have end-to-end
connection top to bottom.

639
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,370
Data can be very difficult to come by,

640
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,000
and this view of our peer grouping

641
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,340
is very helpful for doing that.

642
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,358
So when you have this
historical loss data,

643
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:41,437
that we have access to
in different places,

644
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,229
you can begin to sort of build out

645
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,730
these kinds of concentric circles

646
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,600
of data around organizations.

647
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,750
Ideally, what we wanna be able to do

648
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,820
is measure you against cohort data.

649
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,530
The companies that most
look like you in many ways

650
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,500
in terms of the type of
business profile that you have,

651
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,650
or relative size in terms of revenue

652
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,270
and or employees and
footprint, things like that,

653
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,220
as well as the same geography.

654
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,730
Different types of losses in
different types of industries

655
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,320
that require that we move out
slightly more and move down.

656
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,470
So depending on the industry that ran

657
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,760
and the type of loss
we may have to capture

658
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,980
data from a different sort of filters

659
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,410
to be able to make sure that they can make

660
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,360
a meaningful comparison without it being

661
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,250
representative of other groups

662
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,900
and not your group in particular.

663
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,100
So using all of this data,

664
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,240
rolling it up into our
organizational assessments,

665
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,510
and then providing that sort of output

666
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,184
is sort of what we're
doing here with this model.

667
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:44,620
So the idea is that I think
there's value in thinking about

668
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,090
the role that models
play in your organization

669
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,290
and thinking about what
you can achieve on your own

670
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,820
applying some of the modeling
principles I talked about here

671
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,429
and then sometimes there are
roles for outside organizations

672
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,260
to provide some view into that as well.

673
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,480
So in order to have this type of rigor

674
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,340
it require specialists
that know how to wrap

675
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,530
a model validation work around the things

676
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,899
that you're doing and accelerate maturity.

677
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,500
Sometimes these are things
you can do on your own,

678
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,550
and sometimes there's things that

679
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,463
are accelerated with outside help.

680
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,419
Moving forward, if
you're building a model,

681
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,870
I think it's fully important
that you think about

682
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,093
some of the scoping elements I entered

683
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:25,570
into conversation with you hear about,

684
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,080
for example, the methodology
piece, the rubric piece,

685
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,169
the scoring, what are we
trying to do with this?

686
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,010
And where does this fit
in the organization?

687
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,670
I can tell you in all the organizations

688
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,990
that I've spoken with over
the years, very few of them,

689
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,940
have employed their model
risk management groups

690
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,090
to think about and to engage
in cybersecurity practices.

691
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,240
It's going to increase,

692
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,170
and this type of maturity
is really important

693
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,180
for understanding where these things fit

694
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,700
and the level of validation or rigor

695
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,760
that we need to apply to it.

696
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,170
If you're using that vendor score

697
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,680
and saying it right to the board,

698
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,860
that's something that requires probably

699
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,500
a little bit of rubricking
and contextualizing around

700
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,330
to make sure that these things make sense

701
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,220
when you bring them up there.

702
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,732
And if you're going to
submit to review this way,

703
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:09,340
whether through an internal
group or an external group,

704
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,939
having that validation and that rigor

705
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,662
around your assumptions is
really, really important.

706
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:16,200
And then what I would say a
third here towards the end

707
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,690
is even if you do build your own models,

708
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,892
it's important to have third
parties validate your models.

709
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,120
I think about the same
way in cybersecurity,

710
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,280
we advanced our practice of
encryption by routinely ignoring

711
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,500
somebody who has a
bespoken custom encryption

712
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,740
that has not been exposed
to outside scrutiny.

713
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,390
Very soon, I think we're
going to hit a maturity

714
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,990
where doing the same
thing with our security

715
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,450
and risk models is gonna
be viewed as ludicrous

716
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,840
and without having that extra validation

717
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,071
is very, very important.

718
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,959
So either contracting with
your own outside specialists

719
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,300
or engaging with Model
Risk Management teams

720
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,770
to do something very similar internally

721
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,580
I think that's very, very important.

722
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,480
- I think that's right Jack and in fact,

723
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,810
it's one of the best ways we can help

724
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,120
grow the expertise in
this area which I think

725
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,959
it will be quite important
over the next decade.

726
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,580
This is obviously early
days in terms of shifting

727
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,860
some of the measurements in cybersecurity

728
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,979
from those sort of technical dashboards

729
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,060
that we've been using for
the last 20 years or so,

730
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,950
and into this sort of
more risk-based approach

731
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,630
with an economic view.

732
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,030
And I think the data, you know?

733
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,921
Which we focused on a little bit here

734
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,130
is also improving in that regard.

735
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,640
And I think what we're gonna
see over the next decade,

736
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,350
in this space is pretty
dramatic improvements

737
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,919
in the accessibility of data

738
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,370
to be able to do this type of modeling.

739
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,860
And I think that's gonna take the industry

740
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,340
into a really good place in terms of

741
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,159
how we think about this from
a risk management standpoint.

742
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,160
So unlike other areas where
this type of approach is applied

743
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,450
like property and casualty
insurance or credit,

744
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,748
we don't have those 100-year datasets

745
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:05,490
to use to operate this, but
the data sets are there.

746
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,630
They're emerging, they're
getting better every day,

747
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,492
And we think that, you know?

748
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:14,492
The industry will ultimately
shift to this way of thinking,

749
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,910
and I think it will take a
village and we think, you know?

750
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,440
Good things to come in this space

751
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,140
as more people get involved in it.

752
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,520
- Absolutely, absolutely.

753
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,980
And what we've shown you here
is part of how we're thinking

754
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,810
about building such a Global Cyber Rating

755
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,030
and in further and so our
principle of, you know?

756
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,879
Openness and and transparency,

757
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,382
we want your feedback in this.

758
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:42,480
We are going to be opening up

759
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,830
the full methodology for comments

760
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,870
and feedback here later this year,

761
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,310
but this is sort of an early peek

762
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,800
into what it's going to be.

763
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,033
