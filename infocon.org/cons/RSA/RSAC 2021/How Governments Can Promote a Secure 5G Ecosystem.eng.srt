1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,349
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,070
Thank you for joining us today

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,690
at RSA Conference, albeit virtually.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,900
We're really excited to be here today

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,540
to talk to you a little
bit more about 5G security.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,069
My name is Courtney Lang.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,150
I am a Director of Policy

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,209
at the Information
Technology Industry Council

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,500
where I cover a wide range of issue areas

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,259
including cybersecurity and 5G security.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,600
For those of you that
aren't familiar with ITI,

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,700
we are a global advocacy
organization representing

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,110
over 75 of the world's
leading innovation companies.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,110
So we have members ranging
across the technology sector;

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,010
hardware, software, digital
services, platforms,

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,199
you name it, we probably have it.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,090
So our panelists today are actually

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,580
all ITI member companies.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,470
So we're really excited
to have them here today

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,300
to talk a little bit more
about how governments

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,839
around the world can promote
a secure 5G ecosystem.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,550
I'll start by providing just a bit

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,099
of context for the panel

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,869
and then I will go ahead

25
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,300
and introduce our panelists

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,593
and we will jump into the
discussion after that.

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,770
So with that being said,

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,979
I'm sure for sure for many
of you watching today,

29
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,800
you might be familiar with
the fact that countries

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,090
around the world are taking steps

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,560
to deploy the next generation
of network technology,

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,010
also known as 5G,

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,490
and really looking to reap the benefits

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,690
of this transformational technology

35
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,103
and all the things that it will enable.

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,440
Simultaneously, as this is happening,

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,899
we are also seeing
concerns kind of increasing

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,530
around how to secure these networks,

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,840
particularly because 5G networks

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,840
are undoubtedly critical infrastructure.

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,420
I think it's become
more apparent than ever

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,540
how much we rely on it,

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,150
especially during the pandemic.

44
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,800
And so, it's something
that we've also seen

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,130
policy makers take an increased focus on.

46
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,509
We've seen new ideas emerging

47
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,390
around how to avoid things
like vendor lock-in.

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,180
There's been, you know, a heavy focus

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,150
on Open Radio Access
Networks, for example.

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,890
We've also seen regional tools emerging.

51
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,459
Things like the EU 5G security toolbox

52
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,060
really aimed at addressing a full range

53
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,903
of risk across the 5G ecosystem.

54
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,920
We also need to think a little bit more

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,530
about 5G's evolution,

56
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,960
particularly as we move

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,840
from non standalone to standalone.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,360
And as more and more
parts of the network rely

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,550
upon new 5G technology

60
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,760
to create an end-to-end network.

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,649
There are new and different components,

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,520
almost all of which are being considered

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,420
in a virtualized or
containerized environment.

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,519
And so this is something
else to keep in mind.

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,410
And I think something

66
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,563
that we'll touch on today in our panel.

67
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,010
And finally, you know, as governments look

68
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,320
to promote secure 5G, one of the things

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,630
that we're really seeing is kind of

70
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,590
this narrow focus on supply
chain actors and equipment.

71
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,650
And certainly this is important,

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,720
but it's not the only thing to consider.

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,420
And so, you know, sometimes
this can be detrimental

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,170
to other risk factors

75
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,700
that should be taken into account

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,640
when thinking about the
security of 5G networks.

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,399
So, our panel today will explore the idea

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
of a secure 5G ecosystem,

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,420
and our panelists will
offer thoughts on ways

80
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,160
in which policy makers can help

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,160
to enable a holistic
approach to 5G security

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,670
that addresses threats

83
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,160
and risks to the networks,

84
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,070
as well as the information,
applications and services

85
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,709
that will run on top of them.

86
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,810
So with that, why don't I
introduce the great group

87
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,450
of panelists we have here today

88
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,222
and then we will jump
into the conversation.

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,370
So, I will introduce Danielle Kriz first.

90
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,460
She is a Senior Director of Global Policy

91
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,610
at a cybersecurity company,
Palo Alto Networks,

92
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,570
one of ITI's member companies.

93
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,579
We also have Shehzad Merchant.

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,780
He is the Chief Technology
Officer at Gigamon.

95
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,260
And we also have Scott Charney,

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,649
Vice President of Security
Policy at Microsoft.

97
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,130
So, thank you all for being here today.

98
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,700
Really looking forward to
having a conversation with you

99
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,960
about all of the topics

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,200
that I just alluded to.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,900
So, I think perhaps the best way to start

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,560
is with kind of a context setting

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,740
or level setting question

104
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,590
focused on kind of

105
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,049
what the landscape is
looking like out there.

106
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,010
So, the first thing I'll ask

107
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,230
and feel free to kind
of jump in in any order,

108
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,850
but it's about, you know,

109
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,960
whether you can talk a little bit about

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,250
what trends you're seeing

111
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,640
with regard to how governments
are looking at 5G security

112
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,550
around the world,

113
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,350
and how are countries
thinking about security

114
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,037
in the context of 5G?

115
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,580
What policy measures are they taking

116
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,080
and are there any kind of emerging trends

117
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
that you're seeing to
address the perceived risks?

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,870
- Courtney, I'll start if that's okay.

119
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,580
- Great.
- Thanks again for having me

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,210
here at RSA, although virtual.

121
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,159
Hopefully next year, will be in person.

122
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,720
You know, I think, as Courtney mentioned,

123
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,300
a lot of governments around the world

124
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,460
are paying a lot of
attention to 5G security

125
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,760
and they absolutely should.

126
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,860
One trend that I've seen,

127
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,360
but I think is slowly beginning to change

128
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,520
is, you know, there's been
a little bit of a focus

129
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,419
in the last few years on,

130
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,970
on vendor, right?

131
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,310
Who is building the network

132
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,660
and what is the supply chain

133
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,510
that's going into building 5G networks?

134
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,210
And a policy response has been related

135
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,803
to keeping certain
vendors out of the market.

136
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,549
But I'm seeing a bit of change.

137
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,530
And I think, the change
is the right thing.

138
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,400
As Courtney mentioned,

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,690
there are many, many
aspects to 5G security,

140
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,870
which we'll get into later in the panel,

141
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,580
but there have been some
governments giving guidance

142
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,669
on 5G security

143
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,170
and looking at 5G security more broadly.

144
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,590
I think one important
example is, is in the EU.

145
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,239
You mentioned the 5G toolbox,

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,280
but aside from that,

147
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,113
there is something called

148
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:15,390
the European Electronic
Communications Code,

149
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,770
which is the, a fancy name

150
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,030
for the EU's latest telecom legislation.

151
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,099
There are some security
requirements in that.

152
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,065
And in December 2020,

153
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:27,570
the European Union Security Agency, ENISA,

154
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,300
issued some supplementary guidance

155
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
on 5G security.

156
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,530
It's aimed at the telecom regulators

157
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,119
of all 27 EU member countries.

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,070
And that guidance calls
for the use of technology

159
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,143
such as networks by security,
secure containerization,

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,350
real-time monitoring

161
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,060
for threats going across networks.

162
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,530
So we, you know, there's
other examples as well,

163
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,270
but we're definitely seeing governments

164
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,960
look at this more, more holistically.

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,823
And I'll see if my other
panelists have anything to add.

166
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,140
- This is Scott Charney.

167
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,010
And what I would say is that
governments are becoming

168
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,810
more sophisticated in thinking

169
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,010
about the threat models of 5G.

170
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,260
And so, you have, as you mentioned before,

171
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,130
we're moving from a
place where 5G is mostly

172
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,677
in the end points

173
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,160
and the radio spectrums,

174
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,530
but you're running on the 4G backbone

175
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,077
to a place where it's really
gonna be cloud enabled

176
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,410
end-to-end with virtualized networks

177
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,230
and software defined networks,

178
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,547
and that poses a whole
different threat model.

179
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,240
And you see a lot of focus

180
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,730
on how do we ensure we're
building secure code

181
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,350
and adapt the operational practices

182
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,730
that are more robust

183
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,060
and starting to leverage
the new technologies;

184
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,290
machine learning and AI

185
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,870
that look for anomaly detection

186
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,150
and response work.

187
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,669
You see a lot of that unfolding now

188
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,730
and governments looking

189
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,030
for ways to incentivize
the right behaviors

190
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,130
either through purchasing models

191
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,900
of what they buy

192
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,400
to regulatory models of requiring things.

193
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,940
And the other thing I would say is

194
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,930
while there was a lot

195
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,220
of early fear over country of origin

196
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,970
and often company of origin

197
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,040
and company is a proxy for country

198
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,460
in that context,

199
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,520
that issue remains front and center.

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,770
And I think the reason
for that, in part is,

201
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,070
as I say to people,

202
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,940
the US would not buy it's fighter jets

203
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,840
from the Russians.

204
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,100
And even if the Russian said,

205
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,710
well, but we'll be transparent
about how we built it,

206
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,429
and what's in it.

207
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,099
You still wouldn't do it.

208
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,210
And I think the interesting thing is

209
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,419
that if you go back 40 years, you know,

210
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,914
governments embraced COTS,

211
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,680
commercial off-the-shelf software

212
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,189
because it was inexpensive

213
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,920
and fully featured.

214
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,000
And then they put these
COTS, commercial products

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,210
into their militaries and other places

216
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,340
and now they realize their
military might be dependent

217
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,870
on an adversarial nation.

218
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,560
And that's just the problem.

219
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,530
And so, I think you'll
continue to see focus on that

220
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,689
and some more polarization in the world.

221
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,940
So the government grappling

222
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,510
with all of these issues at once.

223
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,863
And it's, you know, a lot on their plate.

224
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,470
- I'll chime in and maybe add a little bit

225
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,320
to what Scott mentioned.

226
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,870
You know, certainly there
is a strong emphasis

227
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,640
on supply chain

228
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,870
and looking at all aspects

229
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,800
of the supply chain

230
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,510
when it comes to 5G.

231
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,830
But I think what people
are beginning to realize

232
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,530
and governments are beginning
to realize this as well

233
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,760
is that there's a pretty significant shift

234
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,720
in terms of how we built
our mobile networks,

235
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,400
you know, in the 2G, 3G era

236
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,870
versus moving forward to 5G,

237
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,420
even 4G to 5G

238
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,170
where all the network functions

239
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,819
are getting virtualized, right?

240
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,260
And these network functions are coming

241
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,170
from different vendors,
different suppliers.

242
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,599
And so we've gone from

243
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,350
in some sense of monolithic
vertically integrated system

244
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,350
to a completely distributed
software system.

245
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,150
And that is leading to a massive expansion

246
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,000
and explosion in the surface
area of attack, right?

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,820
5G is essentially moving

248
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,450
to a services-based architecture

249
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:18,319
where these services are now coming

250
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,710
from open-source components.

251
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,390
They're coming from commercial vendors.

252
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,120
They're coming from contractors.

253
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,500
And when you sit

254
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,710
and think about security in that arena

255
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,290
I think what we should
be doing is taking a page

256
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,360
out of everything we've learned

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,080
in the world of IT security

258
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,770
because 5G is beginning to look more

259
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,430
and more like that environment

260
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,522
and bring those principles
into the 5G world.

261
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,689
- Great, thanks everyone.

262
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,720
I think that was a
pretty helpful level set

263
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
to kind of talk about the things

264
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,340
that are happening around the world.

265
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,330
A couple of threads in there

266
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,660
that I'd like to pull on a little bit,

267
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,520
and I think Shehzad you got into that

268
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,230
a little bit in your previous remarks.

269
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,040
But just to dive a little bit deeper

270
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,069
I think it would be helpful

271
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,850
to talk a little bit about

272
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,500
how threats might be different

273
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,260
in the context of 5G

274
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,450
and how they might be the same

275
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,680
and kind of what is changing

276
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,739
with regard to the security calculus

277
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,583
with this new generation
of network technology?

278
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,310
- Sure, so, I'll kick it off

279
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,339
and then maybe Danielle

280
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,890
and Scott can add to that as well.

281
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,100
So, you know, when we
sit and think about 5G

282
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,190
we typically, you know, think
about faster speeds, right?

283
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,450
That's the first thing that comes to mind.

284
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,670
5G is a lot more, right?

285
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,500
5G is about faster speeds.

286
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,810
It's about lower latency.

287
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,300
It's about lower power consumption.

288
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,729
It's about higher capacity.

289
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,563
There's a whole set of vectors

290
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,990
that 5G brings to the table.

291
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,234
And in order to accomplish all

292
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,931
of these objectives of 5G,

293
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,670
there are some fundamental
architectural changes

294
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,469
that 5G brings to the table.

295
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,680
For example, one key aspect

296
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,530
of 5G is something called network slicing.

297
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,069
And what network slicing does is,

298
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,890
is essentially carves out
a portion of the 5G network

299
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,240
both the radio access network and the core

300
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,120
and assigns it to a certain
class of applications.

301
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,140
For example, you could
carve out a slice of 5G

302
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,460
for autonomous driving, right?

303
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,530
To guarantee low latency

304
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,410
because you want it to be low latency

305
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,350
if you're in a vehicle

306
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,723
that's driven autonomously.

307
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,060
You can carve out a slice

308
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,410
of the 5G network

309
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,819
for critical infrastructure, right?

310
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,110
But this kind of a model leads

311
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,100
to a different set of threats, right?

312
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,650
Which is that even though
these slices are assigned

313
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,650
to these different industries,

314
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,340
the underlying service-based
architecture is common

315
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,860
in some sense, across these slices.

316
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,330
And so can you actually mount an attack

317
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,960
from one slice to another slice?

318
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,250
And this is exactly
what is being explored.

319
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,490
In fact, there was a pretty
significant disclosure

320
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,430
last month in March,

321
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,530
around some of the security threats

322
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,089
pertaining to networks
license, as an example.

323
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,700
And what are some of the things we need

324
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,533
to be thinking about?

325
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,690
So I think there are some nuances of 5G

326
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,730
that lend themselves

327
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,380
to a very different kinds of attacks.

328
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,980
And what we have to realize is that

329
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,010
when we think of cybersecurity, you know,

330
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,180
in the traditional world,

331
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,310
we, you know, we typically think

332
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,109
of confidentiality, integrity,
and availability, right?

333
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,180
And those are the three key
vectors of cybersecurity.

334
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,750
And we've mostly focused
on confidentiality.

335
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,260
But when you sit and think about security

336
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,130
in the world of 5G,

337
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,070
the attacks are gonna
be more on the integrity

338
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,730
and availability of systems.

339
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,870
And attacks on integrity

340
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,610
and availability tend to have
far more dire consequences

341
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,180
than attacks on the confidentiality
of information, right?

342
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,040
So I think there are some
pretty significant shifts

343
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,204
in the 5G world

344
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:40,850
that we have to sit and think about.

345
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,550
Scott, Danielle, anything
you'd like to add?

346
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,894
- Yes, I think that was a great summary.

347
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:48,440
And as these IT models change,

348
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
the threat models change

349
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,130
and network slicing is an opportunity

350
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,880
for bad guys as well as something

351
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
that might be good for us.

352
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,290
But I'd also say, the other
thing to focus on is scale.

353
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,490
I mean, one of the things
about 5G is this year number

354
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,020
of devices that'll be
out there and connected.

355
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,510
You see these incredible
numbers of, numbers of machines

356
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,200
and it also affects the
way we have to think

357
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,820
about how do you build a
secure 5G infrastructure.

358
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,790
More specifically, you know,

359
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,000
for all the time I've
been in computer security

360
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,470
people have talked about
educating developers

361
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,110
to write secure code,
et cetera, et cetera.

362
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,030
And that's great,

363
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,089
and education's like mom and apple pie.

364
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,460
The problem is it doesn't scale.

365
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,150
You know, if you're gonna have billions

366
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,439
or hundreds of millions of
developers around the world,

367
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,500
or millions of developers,

368
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,890
how do you get them all
to write secure code?

369
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,980
You're not gonna educate
your way out of the problem.

370
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,560
And therefore we have to focus

371
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,630
on how do you do these things at scale.

372
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,120
For example, one of the
things we found at my company,

373
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,810
Microsoft of course, is that

374
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,589
if you're developing code,

375
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,990
you really want the code analyzers,

376
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,370
the static analyzers,

377
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,530
and other security tools

378
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,300
to run as part of the development
process in the platform.

379
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,069
So that people who are developing code

380
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,060
even if they're not security
experts get the benefit

381
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,050
of security in the
platform development model.

382
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,839
And when you think about
reliance on open-source,

383
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,630
you know, the idea that you're gonna

384
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,189
educate every open-source developer

385
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,200
in the world to build good threat models

386
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,340
and write secure code is
just not gonna be successful.

387
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,300
And so, but if you build
into the platforms,

388
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,949
the security tools

389
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,900
and other things that you need is

390
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,100
how you get the scale.

391
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,760
And we have to think about that
not only in developing code

392
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,100
but operational practices.

393
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,690
The only way to get to scale is

394
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,830
through massive automation

395
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,652
that builds and manages security

396
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:45,523
unimagically as the networks run.

397
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,440
- And I wanna add a few things

398
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,580
to these great, great remarks.

399
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,340
I think, you know, one thing that Shehzad

400
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,560
mentioned that's really
important to think about is,

401
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,910
you know, this is about
digital transformation, right?

402
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,910
So 5G, it's, it isn't just
faster speeds and lower latency

403
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,699
and these great things we hear about.

404
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,620
It's a completely different way

405
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,570
of doing business from the 3G and 4G era.

406
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,860
And so companies, as well as governments

407
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,860
around the world are
gonna be leveraging 5G

408
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,320
for digital transformation.

409
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,430
It's a mission critical
part of their business

410
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,689
or it will be.

411
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,050
It's not just a nice communications tool.

412
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,530
So we see governments,
you know, leveraging 5G.

413
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,850
We have some pilot programs

414
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,840
and in efforts in the US in our military.

415
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,437
I know that's happening around the world

416
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:37,010
but a lot of manufacturing companies

417
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,520
and other types of companies
are leveraging 5G also.

418
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,120
So, if it becomes a mission critical

419
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,870
kind of enterprise critical
type of technology,

420
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,890
as Shehzad said,

421
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,890
he called it kind of, an IT,

422
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,410
you need enterprise grade security, right?

423
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,794
So your security has
got to be much stronger

424
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,010
than what may have been acceptable

425
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,800
in earlier generations.

426
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,560
I think picking up on the, the comments

427
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,800
about the new technologies of 5G,

428
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,730
such as slice security

429
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,020
and areas like
containerization, for example,

430
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,060
like the core is being
built in a containerize.

431
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,619
There is also innovation going on

432
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,849
in the cybersecurity field

433
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,319
of how you secure those areas, right?

434
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,569
So we're aware of these
transformations in 5G

435
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,710
that need to be secured.

436
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,500
So you can have 5G slice security,

437
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,300
you can have security of containerization.

438
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,570
So, I think the threats
are definitely larger

439
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,053
and changing and the technology
responses are as well.

440
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,808
- Hey, Courtney, if you don't mind,

441
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,050
I'd like to just do a quick followup

442
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,460
to some of the comments as well

443
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,130
because I think these are important points

444
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,170
that were made by both
Danielle and Scott as well.

445
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,900
And that is if you sit

446
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,030
and think about any
security strategy, right?

447
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,450
One of the learnings we
have from the IT world is

448
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,350
that you have to build resiliency, right?

449
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,100
You can't have a single point of failure

450
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,429
and security is multi-tiered
in that sense, right?

451
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,263
You build layers and layers

452
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:08,040
of security in your overall stack.

453
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,800
And when we sit and think
about the applicability

454
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,810
of this in the 5G world,

455
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,480
Danielle talked about the fact

456
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,280
that the core is now
being built, you know,

457
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,240
for example using
containerized functions, right?

458
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,950
And virtualized functions as an example.

459
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,720
Scott talked about scaling
as a big challenge as well.

460
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,110
And so I think one of the ways

461
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,820
to bring all of this together, right?

462
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,750
Because you will have
some functions coming

463
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,760
from certain vendors, other
functions from other vendors,

464
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,593
some running in containers,

465
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:31,820
some running in virtual machines,

466
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,697
some running in hardware as well.

467
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,100
And all of these ultimately are going

468
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,459
to be tied together

469
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,340
by the mobile network operator, right?

470
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,429
They're the ones who are
putting it all together.

471
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,530
And, the glue in my view

472
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,580
that ties all of this together
really is the network, right?

473
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,770
Because all of these
containerized functions talk

474
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,830
to each other over a network, right?

475
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,149
The virtual functions talk to
each other over the network.

476
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,260
Anytime there's a bad actor,

477
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,740
they, you know, there's any
command and control activity,

478
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,703
it happens over the network.

479
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,770
Data exfiltration
happens over the network.

480
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,610
Lateral movement happens over the network.

481
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,810
And so I think in a world

482
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,870
where many of these 5G
functions are going to come

483
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,312
from different vendors,

484
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,230
in a world where the
underlying technologies

485
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,780
are going to come from different vendors.

486
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,149
The container technology may
be open-source technology.

487
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,490
It may be commercial technology.

488
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,323
The functions running

489
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:23,380
on that may be coming
from different vendors.

490
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,890
You need some glue that
binds it all together

491
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,380
and can provide to you
an end-to-end perspective

492
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,270
on tying some of this.

493
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,240
And so, I think increasingly the role

494
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,240
of network based security
in 5G environments,

495
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
I think is going to increase

496
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,753
as really the glue

497
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:38,659
that brings it all together.

498
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,790
I just wanna toss this out

499
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,909
and maybe if people have
comments on that, that's great

500
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,263
or we can move on as well.

501
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,040
- Great, yeah, thanks Shehzad.

502
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,680
I think, you know,
perhaps we can roll along

503
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,540
into the next question.

504
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,220
I wanted to focus a little bit more

505
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,886
on some of the kind of policy questions

506
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:01,860
that have been brought up here today.

507
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,330
And talk a little bit more
about a couple of themes

508
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,949
that were raised in some
of the opening remarks.

509
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,560
Scott, in particular, I know
you raised country of origin

510
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,100
as something that has been a focus.

511
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,790
And I think one of the questions

512
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,020
that I wanted to pose to folks,

513
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,180
and I think that would be useful

514
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,000
to people that are watching this,

515
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,090
is, you know, what role
should country of origin play

516
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,629
in security policy?

517
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,490
Particularly as we're
talking about 5G security,

518
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,870
I think, you know, we'd be interested

519
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,084
to hear your perspectives

520
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:33,920
on kind of where that should sit

521
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,540
and in the grand scheme of things.

522
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,370
And as we're thinking
about network security

523
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,543
more generally, what
role that should play?

524
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,840
- Well, I certainly think in the context

525
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,490
of government functions

526
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,670
and critical infrastructures,

527
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,250
country of origin will
continue to play a large role.

528
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,790
And, you know, one can just
imagine a scenario where

529
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,649
in some sort of geopolitical conflict,

530
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,080
your telecommunication
systems became unavailable

531
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,470
and your populous learn

532
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,000
that you were completely dependent

533
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,220
on adversarial product
to run your network.

534
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,450
And that turned out to
be a really bad idea.

535
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,950
I think the challenge

536
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,680
for governments, for policy
makers is, you know, twofold.

537
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,730
One is the global supply chain is

538
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,170
an integrated global supply chain.

539
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,170
You know, it's fine to say

540
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,210
let's just bifurcate everything out

541
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,730
and split everything apart

542
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,950
and have a polarized environment.

543
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,210
But there's really no
country on the planet

544
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,860
that can create everything today.

545
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,229
Or trusted groups of countries.

546
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,020
And so, you know, its
gonna remain dependency

547
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,889
on one another

548
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,620
even if it makes countries uncomfortable

549
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,080
in some contexts.

550
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,379
And so, going back to what
Shehzad said, you know,

551
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,260
part of all security is defense in depth.

552
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,910
So you have to figure out

553
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,170
if you have some supply chain risks

554
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,410
that is cannot be eliminated

555
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,420
because it's about risk
management not risk elimination.

556
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,380
How do you figure out

557
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,040
how to manage the residual risk

558
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,850
and yet still have a
relatively safe environment,

559
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,590
you know, for legal purposes.

560
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,520
And then the second thing is

561
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,120
you don't wanna throw the baby out

562
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,260
with the bath water.

563
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,930
So for example, you might be concerned

564
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,280
about having adversarial product

565
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,629
running the communications
of The White House

566
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,340
but that doesn't mean that, you know,

567
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,330
people shouldn't buy a certain

568
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,560
baby monitor made from, you know,

569
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,530
a foreign entity

570
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,399
or other kinds of technology

571
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,160
that just doesn't pose the
kind of national security

572
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,270
and public safety risks

573
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,240
that governments tend to worry about.

574
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,310
And the real challenges
is trying to sort that out

575
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,067
and figure out what's in what bucket.

576
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,420
You know, if you think about
things like microprocessors,

577
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,860
well they're in everything.

578
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,693
So it's not like you can,

579
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,590
you know, have them in some things

580
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,810
and not others.

581
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,230
But there are certainly functions

582
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,810
and, that you worry about in
terms of critical functions

583
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,230
that you're gonna be more
aggressive about source.

584
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,620
And that's why you see
governments as a matter of policy

585
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,560
looking at things like SBOM,
software bill of materials

586
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
and hardware bill of materials.

587
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,830
So at least when you're purchasing,

588
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,770
you understand that the risks

589
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,610
that you're accepting

590
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,449
where the product comes from,

591
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,050
where it may have been developed,

592
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,883
and then, you know,

593
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:20,510
how do you actually certify products?

594
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,180
So you can say, okay,

595
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,630
this was built pursuant
to good security practices

596
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,350
and processes versus
something that wasn't.

597
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,929
And so there, it's gonna remain a factor

598
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,700
and the key will be trying
to narrow your exposure

599
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,583
and then manage the residual risk.

600
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,770
- So if, you know, maybe a quick comment

601
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,740
from my end as well.

602
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,210
You know, this is a
complex problem, right?

603
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,410
Country of origin is an issue.

604
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,490
But in my mind, it's one vector

605
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,460
to be thinking about.

606
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,330
And it's a lot easier dealing

607
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,560
with country of origin

608
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,000
when it comes to hardware.

609
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,260
When it comes to chips, right?

610
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,900
I mean, you know, where
is this chip manufacturer?

611
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,767
Where is a system assembled, right?

612
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,320
Where is the manufacturing facility?

613
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,060
Country of origin becomes very difficult

614
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,350
to deal with when it
comes to software, right?

615
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,030
And I think this is the big shift

616
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,300
that's going on in the world of 5G.

617
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,409
Yes, you know, there's
always going to be hardware

618
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,300
but increasingly, you know,

619
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,950
when you sit and think about the core,

620
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,000
moving away from the RAN,

621
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,670
if you sit and think about the core,

622
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,700
it's running on servers, right?

623
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,080
And it's running on servers

624
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,199
because everything is essentially

625
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,546
moving through the software model.

626
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:32,550
And where your software is
essentially be getting pulled

627
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,409
from open-source,

628
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,520
as an example, you're
using Docker Kubernetes

629
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,470
or you're using
microservices architectures

630
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,797
like, you know, Istio.

631
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,840
It's hard to say

632
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,929
what the country of origin is

633
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,330
because, you know, it's really difficult

634
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,520
to track who's contributed

635
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,670
to that open-source

636
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,310
and what backdoors have been inserted

637
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,419
into that open-source, right?

638
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,470
So, I think country of origin is important

639
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,710
but it is one vector.

640
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,920
And it's one vector

641
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,080
that you can deal with relatively easy

642
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,120
when it comes to hardware,

643
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,270
but it gets far more, you know, murky

644
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,770
when you move beyond the hardware

645
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,690
and start looking at software.

646
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,190
And I don't have an easy answer to that.

647
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,490
I'm just pointing out
that that's an issue.

648
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,590
- And let me add to Shehzad's point

649
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,092
and to go in, it's not just open-source.

650
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,080
I mean, you know, I could go back years

651
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,879
and I would have some governments say,

652
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,420
you know, Windows is made in
America, you know, in Redmond.

653
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,910
And I go, yes,

654
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,410
by a workforce that is
international in scope.

655
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,380
I mean, we have everyone

656
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,520
from everywhere writing code.

657
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,455
And so, you know, software
whether it's open-source

658
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,899
or proprietary software

659
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,360
may be made by the
international community.

660
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,560
That's just the reality of it.

661
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,773
- Well, Scott does one,

662
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:45,773
if it's okay to maybe be a
little controversial as well.

663
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,840
I just want to come back
on the baby monitor thing

664
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,484
because it's an area that's, you know,

665
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,679
I've thought about

666
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,550
and we've chatted about

667
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,860
in the past, in multiple areas as well.

668
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,149
I don't think we should be careful even

669
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,380
when buying baby monitors,

670
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,500
because what happens is

671
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,540
vulnerabilities transcends systems, right?

672
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,879
So we all know about the Mirai botnet

673
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,020
which I think 2016, 2017,

674
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,100
which was essentially a malware embedded

675
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,860
into a bunch of home equipment,

676
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,570
like video surveillance,
you know, cameras, right?

677
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,730
Home camera systems, DVRs,

678
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,480
which essentially mounted
a massive attack on Dyn,

679
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,100
which was a DNS provider

680
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,810
which brought on portions of
the entire internet, right?

681
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,030
And so, you know, in
those kinds of systems,

682
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,497
the collective power of
these kinds of systems

683
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:36,280
can bring down portions of the internet.

684
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,120
There is potentially an impact in thinking

685
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,969
about country of origin,

686
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,903
even for these consumers goods.

687
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,870
- It's an interesting point,

688
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,929
but I wonder if it's really

689
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,680
about country of origin,

690
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,190
where the process by which
the product was made.

691
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,220
So, if you take a country
of origin approach

692
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,220
you'd say, you cannot, we
cannot allow China, Russia

693
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,780
and various countries
to sell baby monitors

694
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,970
in the US, all right stop.

695
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,020
That, and then you'd go into a complete,

696
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,879
okay, we can't take any product

697
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,080
from any country

698
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,610
because it connects.

699
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,397
The problem with the
Mirai botnet in part is

700
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:12,560
you know, if you don't
have an updating process,

701
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,659
if you have default passwords, you know,

702
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,730
if you have bad practices,

703
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,890
you're gonna put everything at risk.

704
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,440
And so, but you're right.

705
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,000
It's very hard like, our baby monitors,

706
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,980
where do you draw the line?

707
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,780
And then is baby monitor on
the safe part of the line

708
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,330
or the non-safe part of the line

709
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,163
for country of origin?

710
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,750
It's really hard to make those--

711
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,170
- It totally is

712
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,847
and maybe bring it back to this,

713
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,210
you know, the policy conversation

714
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,300
'cause I know Courtney wants

715
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,470
to keep us on track a little bit here.

716
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,303
(laughs)

717
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:40,350
To bring it back to policy.

718
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,340
This is a policy conversation, right?

719
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,250
Which is that, you know,
how do you incentivize

720
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,510
the right buying behavior, right?

721
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,703
And from a consumer perspective

722
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,300
when we go and buy things,

723
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,580
we don't look at the security thing.

724
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,750
When people buy baby monitors

725
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,170
they don't look at the security of that.

726
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,133
And so I think, you know,

727
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,510
when you extrapolate that
even to the world of 5G

728
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,370
I think that has to be policy

729
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,919
that drives security

730
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,910
because sometimes the buyers do not know

731
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,310
what to look for in terms
of security footprint.

732
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,660
- Let me add to pull on a thread

733
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,860
that, a couple of threads
have come through.

734
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,350
I think, you know, it's not
only incentivizing the buyer

735
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,790
but it is incentivizing
the producer, right?

736
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,570
And so, you know, I think
Scott alluded to as well

737
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,919
secure software development

738
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,890
and these practices that companies take.

739
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,070
So, you know, again, the
country of origin aside,

740
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,780
you know, governments
should be incentivizing

741
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,310
good supply chain practices

742
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,010
by any ICT vendor, right?

743
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,190
Because there's so many
different technologies

744
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,800
that are going into 5G networks.

745
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,040
Again, you can't
completely eliminate risks

746
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,260
but you can manage for it.

747
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,610
And one of the things you can do is

748
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,250
to help identify

749
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,250
and point out what are some

750
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,300
of the really good supply
chain practices out there

751
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,353
whether they have to do with hardware

752
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:54,830
or software development

753
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,810
or end of life or anything,

754
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,610
how you treat your code as you develop it.

755
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,320
And then incentivize good behavior.

756
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,700
That could be through procurements.

757
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,650
It could be other ways,

758
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,120
but there is an important role

759
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,279
that governments can play to try

760
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,497
and improve things in that way.

761
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,430
- And I'd like to build on that

762
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,210
because one of the challenges
governments have is

763
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,790
to figure out how you
measure those practices

764
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,000
and certify products.

765
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,330
You know, those of us who've been around

766
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,649
for a long time

767
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,640
know that the governments use
common criteria, for example

768
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,480
to evaluate products.

769
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,840
And they would evaluate
a product and certify,

770
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,870
and years after it had been in the market

771
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,979
and the next version
of it already shipped.

772
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,600
And they would certify a product

773
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,730
which would still then be hacked

774
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,070
because it had all sorts of challenges.

775
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,753
So we do need right processes, of course.

776
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,770
But one of the challenges for governments

777
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,590
of a matter of policy
is how do you then say,

778
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,000
okay, this product followed
the processes with enough rigor

779
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,110
that it's okay to actually purchase.

780
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,699
And that's a hard problem.

781
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,530
- Yeah, and I wanna pick up one thing

782
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,530
on the Mirai botnet example as well,

783
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,930
because I think, you know,

784
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,350
that's an example of an attack

785
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,409
where, you know, the only way

786
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,100
to really stop cyber attacks successfully

787
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,689
is if you're trying to stop it

788
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,870
at all the parts of the cyber
attack life cycle, right?

789
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,669
I mean, the cyber attacks
are not just a one and done.

790
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,110
You have to do reconnaissance

791
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,219
and, you know, the penetrating network

792
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,480
and being backed and get instructions.

793
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,380
And, you know, it's a multi-step process.

794
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,620
And so, you know, cybersecurity

795
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,020
whether you call it defense in depth

796
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,901
or making sure that there's protections

797
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:33,710
and preventions at all stages

798
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,320
of a cybersecurity attack life cycle,

799
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,490
you know, policies like that,

800
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,240
that promote that type of investment

801
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,770
by enterprises or anybody, you know,

802
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,020
kind of bringing it back to 5G.

803
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,420
If you're investing in 5G,

804
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,140
making sure that you're
able to stop attacks

805
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,040
at various points in time,

806
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,340
I think it's very important.

807
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,173
And so that's something

808
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:55,533
that government should
be incentivizing as well.

809
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,760
- Great, I want to be
mindful of time here.

810
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,760
So maybe just one other question

811
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,862
to kind of wrap us up here.

812
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,840
Obviously what we're trying to do today is

813
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,070
share perspectives with policy makers

814
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,530
about what they can be doing

815
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,680
to help move the needle forward

816
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,320
on 5G security in a way

817
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,100
that is really holistic and comprehensive.

818
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,570
And so, I think, you know, it
would be interesting to hear

819
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,919
and I'm gonna meld two
questions together here.

820
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,770
What your, what your
top recommendations are

821
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,129
for governments as
they're seeking to deploy

822
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,360
and or support the secure
deployment of 5G networks?

823
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,020
And as a part of that, you know,

824
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,879
I think one of the things

825
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,920
that we've seen is kind of this tendency

826
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,150
or desire by governments
to view 5G security

827
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,800
through the lens of trustworthiness.

828
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,159
And that's something I know in the US

829
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,640
that has been, you know, talked
about pretty significantly

830
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,390
is what makes a vendor trustworthy

831
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,410
or a vendor trusted.

832
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,440
So kind of tying those two
together, would be interested

833
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,400
to hear your top
recommendations for governments,

834
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,580
but also, you know,

835
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,470
when thinking about trustworthiness,
perhaps key criteria

836
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,217
that should go into that consideration

837
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,170
if governments are using
that as a measurement

838
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,240
of, you know, whether or not

839
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,503
a vendor can be used in a network.

840
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,480
- Well, I'm happy to start.

841
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,650
I think I would say a couple of things.

842
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,920
One is the government need

843
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,360
to focus on secured development

844
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,820
and operational practices holistically

845
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,850
which I think they are doing now.

846
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,929
They need to always think about scale,

847
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,410
which is does this solution

848
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,630
for those things actually scale across

849
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,190
this incredible IT
infrastructure we've built.

850
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,750
And they need to think
about standardization

851
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,890
because if we're gonna
sell in a global market

852
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,070
and you're gonna have vendors

853
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,189
from all over the world

854
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,849
whether it's hardware or software,

855
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,450
you need, you know industry led

856
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,050
government participated standards.

857
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,190
We have to think about

858
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,930
how do you measure the success

859
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,190
of following these practices?

860
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,000
And then how do we leverage
emerging technologies

861
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,700
particularly machine learning, AI

862
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,270
to do anomaly detection

863
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,670
because all the great security

864
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,480
in the world will not
stop the attacks, right?

865
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
People will continue to try to attack.

866
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
And at the scale that we will be working

867
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,220
being able to define what's normal

868
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,580
versus what's anomalous
will be a challenge.

869
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,750
And I think machines could be a huge help

870
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,520
in figuring that out

871
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,070
and then pointing people
at remedial actions

872
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,913
that we can execute on quickly.

873
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,260
- I wanna pick up on what Scott said

874
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,800
It helps me with, for my recommendations.

875
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,129
Machine learning and AI
are absolutely essential.

876
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,830
I mean, you know, companies like ours

877
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,280
and I'm sure colleagues
in the panel, you know,

878
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,570
we're using machine learning

879
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,740
and increasingly AI to
do our cybersecurity.

880
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,017
You know, to deliver solutions

881
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,090
and to secure our customers.

882
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,429
And it's not only detecting
the anomalous behavior.

883
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,620
You can use machine learning

884
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,860
and AI to automatically prevent

885
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,670
and stop that behavior
from moving forward.

886
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,600
So there's great advances
in machine learning

887
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,540
and AI for cybersecurity generally

888
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,719
that are happening all the time

889
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,489
that can and need to be leveraged for 5G.

890
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,080
I think my second recommendation may be

891
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
kind of very, very simple

892
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,070
for those of us on the panel

893
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,943
but hopefully it, you know, is useful.

894
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,070
Is really about the absolute need

895
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,567
to involve industry

896
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:37,567
in any policy making
thinking or development.

897
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,359
You know, this field
is moving very quickly.

898
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,510
I mean, IT always moves very
quickly so does cybersecurity.

899
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,780
So any type of government policy response

900
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,710
to issues that they want to try and fix,

901
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,739
you have to be involving
companies like ours

902
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,409
and many others in the discussions.

903
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,370
Like we have, we're looking
at cyber threats constantly.

904
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,507
We're constantly innovating in areas

905
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:04,550
that are really important to 5G security,

906
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,453
whether it's, you know,

907
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:06,530
a slice security

908
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,420
or, you know, securing the various layers

909
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,870
like the data layer

910
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,500
and signaling layer and others.

911
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,210
And, you know, we can
help be part of the answer

912
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,050
and the solution.

913
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,049
And so, I think, you
know, governments working

914
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,880
with companies like ours

915
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,600
and other stakeholders

916
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,450
that, that's really integral

917
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,343
to a successful policy.

918
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,930
- And so I'll tackle on a
slightly different dimension.

919
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,930
I agree completely with Danielle and Scott

920
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,258
but I wanted to bring on a
slightly different dimension

921
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:39,210
in terms of, you know, one of the things

922
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,840
I could potentially think
about recommending as well,

923
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,780
is that when you sit

924
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,210
and think about 5G,

925
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,410
as I'd mentioned earlier

926
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,510
there are multiple components

927
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,970
all coming from different places, right?

928
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,060
So, for example, one part

929
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,270
of 5G is the mobile edge, right?

930
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,280
Or multi-access edge computing or MEC,

931
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,270
which is really you just sit

932
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,790
and think about it, it's the cloud

933
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,890
but closer to the edge

934
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,690
so that you have lower latency.

935
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,830
And that cloud is going to be provided

936
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,180
by cloud service providers, right?

937
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,600
And applications will run on top of that.

938
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,130
And just like in the cloud,

939
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,670
as we think about AWS, Azure

940
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,420
that has a shared security model

941
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,870
there will be a shared security model

942
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,890
because somebody is gonna
build an autonomous driving app

943
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,879
on top of the MEC
solution running over 5G.

944
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,490
And if there's a compromise in that model

945
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,669
who's responsible for the failure, right?

946
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,460
Is it the cloud provider?

947
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,030
Is it the application provider?

948
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,564
Is it the mobile service provider?

949
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:34,330
Because there are multiple
entities here, right?

950
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,080
And so I think from a
regulatory perspective

951
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,130
and I, I don't like more regulation,

952
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,310
but I think in this situation

953
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,240
there probably needs to be more regulation

954
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,270
to the security side.

955
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,790
I feed on the mobile
service provider side.

956
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,070
And this worked really, really well

957
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,770
in the credit card industry, right?

958
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,620
When the onus was put on
the credit card issuers

959
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,770
to deal with fraud,

960
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,650
initially it was a pretty big backlash,

961
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,040
but they bought some pretty,
you know, sophisticated systems

962
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,100
to detect fraud.

963
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,020
And the onus was not on the consumer.

964
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,310
The onus was not in the
point of sale provider.

965
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,150
It really came down to
the credit card issuer.

966
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,860
And, I think perhaps

967
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,440
that may be a page to draw over here

968
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,300
and saying, to say that if, you know,

969
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,770
you have the cloud service provider,

970
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,603
you have the consumer,

971
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:17,810
you have the mobile service provider,

972
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,400
you have all these different entities,

973
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,010
perhaps the entity that's
really offering the service

974
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,690
which is the mobile service
provider should be responsible

975
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,360
and should have a greater
onus on their shoulders

976
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,380
for the security of that infrastructure.

977
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,420
Even though the components are coming

978
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,890
from a bunch of different
places as well, right?

979
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,089
So maybe that would be my thinking

980
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,206
in terms of regulation

981
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:38,930
and recommendations is
to put a little more onus

982
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,330
on the mobile service provider

983
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,370
for taking ownership of
the overall security.

984
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,049
- And can I add one other

985
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,620
kind of different point, which is--

986
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,605
- Briefly, we're very close
to our end of tenure here.

987
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:50,510
- I'll be very brief.

988
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,740
Even if we do all this security right,

989
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,220
we will still be attacked

990
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,529
because there's a lot
of geopolitical conflict

991
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,670
in the world.

992
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,520
And I think industry needs to engage more

993
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,840
on international norms

994
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,180
and how we think about

995
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,580
what is acceptable
behavior on the internet,

996
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,279
even among nation states.

997
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,740
There are some in industry

998
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,629
who go well, that's a government function,

999
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,080
but if you look at the attacks,

1000
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,759
whether it be SolarWinds, tax grab

1001
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,980
or whatever, industry is often the first

1002
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,880
to detect and respond,

1003
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,920
even to nation state attacks,

1004
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,840
and we need to lower the volume

1005
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,160
of that kind of activity

1006
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,353
on the internet to make it safer.

1007
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,980
- Great, well with that,
I wanna thank everyone

1008
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,160
for taking their time today

1009
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,149
to share your thoughts

1010
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,760
on 5G security.

1011
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,480
Time flies, so we're already
at the end of our session

1012
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,970
but certainly welcome folks

1013
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,180
in the audience to ask questions

1014
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,990
in the chat box of our panelists.

1015
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,279
We really look forward
to answering anything

1016
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,090
you might wonder about
based on the comments

1017
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,070
that you heard here today.

1018
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,730
So thanks again for having us

1019
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,850
at the RSA Conference this year

1020
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,346
and we look forward to your questions.
