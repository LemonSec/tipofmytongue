1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,650
- Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm Lori Mac Vittie, and I'm
going to be moderating today

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,129
on a panel entitled
,Web Attacks and Fraud;

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,420
Lessons Learned from the
Deep End of the Pool.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,080
And to help me are two people,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,339
security experts who have been
in that deep end of the pool.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,580
I have with me, Sara Boddy,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,919
senior director of F5 labs

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,700
threat intelligent reporting division,

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,460
and Dan woods, VP of the
Shape Intelligence Center.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,980
Now, Dan, you have a
very storied background,

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,349
so I'd like you to start.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,100
Just give us an introduction and explain

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,450
where you've been in that
deep end of the pool.

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,900
- Well, I guess I started my
career more than 25 years ago,

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,890
working a bit as a patrol officer.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,260
And I had a real passion
for computer crimes.

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,010
So I went to college,

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,019
studied computer systems
engineering at Arizona State.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,890
And then I was dispatched

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,600
to my very first computer
crime as a patrol officer.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
When I got to the crime
scene, unfortunately,

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,350
I learned somebody had thrown
a laptop through a window,

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,559
so it wasn't exactly the
type of computer crime

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,890
I was hoping for.

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,150
So I realized that I
wasn't going to be getting

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,390
the sorts of computer crimes

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,090
I wanted to as a patrol officer.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,690
So I left and joined CIA as
a cyber operations officer.

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,770
That was a great job.

31
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,640
I traveled all over the world,

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,803
helping our human intelligence assets,

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,530
collect information of
interest to policy makers.

34
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,620
But then at 36 and a half years old,

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,210
I realized that if I didn't go to FBI,

36
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,630
I could never go to FBI,

37
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,410
because as many in the
audience likely know,

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,872
FBI has an age requirement.

39
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,760
You have to be 37 or younger than 37

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,810
by the time you finish the Academy,

41
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,060
otherwise they're not going to hire you.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,060
So they discriminate based on
age, and it's perfectly legal.

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,620
So I went to FBI as a special
agent for a few years,

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,590
working cyber terrorism cases,

45
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,920
then went back to CIA as a contractor.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,240
And then years later I joined Shape.

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,450
And at Shape we're
protecting organizations

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,940
from automated attacks,

49
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,683
and frankly that was pretty jaw dropping.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,710
And then F5 acquired Shape just last year.

51
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,694
And I've been part of
the F5 family ever since,

52
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,023
and been loving it.

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,010
- Awesome. Awesome.

54
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,980
Sara has a very interesting title, right?

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,230
Threat intelligence in reporting division.

56
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,100
So what does that mean,

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,760
and how are you complimentary to Dan?

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,989
Because you really are,
listening to your conversations.

59
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,823
- Yeah.

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,820
It's making me realize, Lori,

61
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,859
I probably should have went first,

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,002
cause Dan's a pretty tough act to follow.

63
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,260
(laughter)

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,880
His bio is absolutely fascinating.

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,410
And it's equally fascinating

66
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,040
to listen to the stories
you have to tell, Dan,

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,480
so I'm excited to do a panel with you.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,769
A little bit about my background.

69
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,560
I started out in the information
security industry late 90s.

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,393
I worked for

71
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,990
a boutique network security
consulting firm in Seattle.

72
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,090
And then right before,

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,019
I worked in the consulting
industry for a long time,

74
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,550
and then I got into operational security.

75
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,510
So before I came to F5,

76
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,429
I was the VP of information security

77
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,390
and business intelligence

78
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,040
at a company called Demand Media.

79
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,760
I think what has come up most in my career

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,660
in cybersecurity outside of compliance,

81
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,799
is business just not understanding risk,

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,870
and the willingness to
take on too much risk.

83
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,850
And as a result, throughout my career,

84
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,359
I've dealt with a lot
of incident response.

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
And that's actually what led
me to threat intelligence.

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,000
I think a lot of people in
the operational security world

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,050
get really burned out
defending all the time,

88
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,193
especially with the ongoing
onslaught of attacks

89
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:53,840
that they're constantly defending,

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,800
breaches they have to
investigate et cetera.

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,310
So I just kinda wanted to look
at the problem differently,

92
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,840
which is what got me
into threat intelligence.

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
So about five years ago, I
came to F5 to start F5 Labs,

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,930
which is our threat
intelligence reporting division.

95
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,770
And the reason why

96
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,670
I say threat intelligence
reporting division,

97
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,820
is because there's tons of teams across F5

98
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,299
that do threat intelligence.

99
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,133
We have to,

100
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:18,450
if you think about the security
products that we support.

101
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,120
Everybody has to be looking at attacks,

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,700
writing signatures for
Westford, for instance.

103
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,250
That's the most simple example.

104
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,010
But there's a lot of
different teams across F5,

105
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,736
including Dan's that do a
lot of threat intelligence.

106
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:31,840
And so we aggregate that
and report out on it.

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,349
So that's what my team does

108
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,150
in relation to how we work with Dan.

109
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,130
And I would just say

110
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,280
in terms of my contribution
to this conversation,

111
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm really passionate
about educating people

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,180
about cybersecurity.

113
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,480
I think we need more
education in this space,

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,830
especially people outside
of the security profession,

115
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,900
the business people that we
talk to on a regular basis,

116
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,210
to be successful with security.

117
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,390
So I think that's where the
audience would probably see me

118
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,940
the most contributing
to this conversation.

119
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,510
- Your passion shows, Sara.

120
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,030
I've watched many of your presentations,

121
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,969
and always come away having learned a lot.

122
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,803
- I try to be.

123
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:11,187
(laughter)

124
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,020
- I agree with Dan.

125
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,349
I've watched you many times
give keynotes, and be at panels.

126
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,680
And you're just very passionate.

127
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,810
Even just having conversations

128
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,120
about what we wanted to talk
about in this webinar, right?

129
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,417
You were very passionate
about what you wanted to say,

130
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,159
how you wanted to say it.

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,260
It's been a fascinating adventure.

132
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,770
And I think one of the
things you alluded to

133
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,909
when you were talking there, right?

134
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,650
Is really about complexity.

135
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,440
That the complexity of attacks,

136
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,719
the complexity of
infrastructure applications,

137
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,550
just the environments
that we're working in

138
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,280
is so incredible today
that it's really hard

139
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,820
to get a handle on
security, where do I start?

140
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,469
And I think one of the lessons
that I've learned from Dan,

141
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,940
and I'd love for him to dive into it,

142
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,210
is the simplification of vulnerabilities.

143
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,099
Understanding the difference
between what he calls

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,380
inherent vulnerabilities and inadvertent.

145
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,320
Because those provide different
means of protection, right?

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,830
You have to deal with them differently.

147
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,409
So Dan, could you explain
the difference there,

148
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,510
and how you simplify those categories?

149
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,400
So we can dive into them?

150
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,270
- Yeah, you're right, Lori.

151
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,792
It is very complex.

152
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,890
So for somebody like me,

153
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,419
I like to just really simplify it

154
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,320
and make it really easy to understand.

155
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,760
And I think breaking these vulnerabilities

156
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,099
into those two categories,

157
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,750
inherent vulnerabilities and
inadvertent vulnerabilities,

158
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,000
makes a lot of sense.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,733
The inadvertent vulnerabilities

160
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:41,690
are the types of vulnerabilities
that result from mistakes,

161
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,940
from configuration errors,
from programming mistakes.

162
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,219
These are the OWASP Top 10, right?

163
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,810
The cross-site scripting
and SQL injection.

164
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,940
These are things that can be patched.

165
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,310
It can be corrected through
better security hygiene.

166
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,200
The inherent vulnerabilities
are different.

167
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,670
They cannot be patched in
that traditional sense.

168
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,503
For example,

169
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,620
you are vulnerable to a
credential stuffing attack,

170
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,300
where a bad actor takes
usernames and passwords

171
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,850
from the spill or from dark web,

172
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,610
and just tries them programmatically

173
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,660
against your login application.

174
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,110
You're vulnerable to those

175
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,880
because you have a login application.

176
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,820
So they're really just
abusing the functionality

177
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,693
the way it was intended to be used.

178
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,660
So not like you could take down

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,020
the login application, right?

180
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,490
You need to offer your customers

181
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,430
an ability to create
accounts, log into accounts,

182
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,090
maybe go through a
forgot password workflow.

183
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,330
And the result from a
critical business requirement.

184
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,200
So that's how I like to think about it.

185
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,729
The inadvertent vulnerabilities

186
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,210
and the inherent vulnerabilities,

187
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,630
and what Shape specializes
in is protecting enterprises

188
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,630
from exploits that attack
the inherent vulnerabilities.

189
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,260
- Can I give a little context
here on how the breach...?

190
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,010
Cause landscape has shifted
in relation to Dan's point?

191
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,707
I love the way you frame this up, Dan.

192
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:09,159
I think this is the right way
to simplify the conversation,

193
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,370
especially when you're
trying to talk about

194
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,600
risks with business people.

195
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,177
So we do analysis on the
root cause of breaches.

196
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:20,540
And the primary root cause
of breaches from the late 90s

197
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,220
through 2018 was a result of
an inadvertent vulnerabilities.

198
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,520
So like what Dan said,
configuration mistakes.

199
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,760
One of the primary root cause of breaches

200
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,730
prior to 2018 was SQL injection, right?

201
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,450
Which is 20 year old vulnerability

202
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
that we still have challenges.

203
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,940
What we saw in a large analysis

204
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,960
of over a decade of
breaches prior to 2018,

205
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,080
the research concluded in 2017 actually,

206
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,650
was that whereas the primary
root cause of breaches

207
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,579
was inadvertent web
application misconfiguration,

208
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,913
and not secure coding.

209
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,000
We saw that so much had
been collected on people,

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,180
especially citizens of the United States,

211
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,680
that we expected access related attacks

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,469
to become the number one
root cause of breaches,

213
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,600
simply because attackers had so much data.

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,730
They could power access
attacks a lot more effectively.

215
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,070
We said that username and password

216
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,180
should be treated as public,

217
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,689
including social security numbers.

218
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,050
And we anticipated to see a shift

219
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,380
in the root cause of breaches,

220
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,100
away from web application exploits

221
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
into primary access targeted attacks

222
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,120
like phishing and credential stuffing.

223
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,490
And that shift actually happened in 2018.

224
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,240
There was a big shift
from web related attacks

225
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,580
to access related to attacks,

226
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,080
as being the primary
root cause of breaches.

227
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,030
And that's been consistent ever since.

228
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,030
So we're done with the 2020
root cause analysis of breaches.

229
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,240
And access attacks, again,
are the majority over 50%.

230
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,910
You are seeing a little bit of shift

231
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,760
in the breech root cause
landscape due to ransomware,

232
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,510
but again, it's landing through phishing

233
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,670
and email related attacks

234
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,880
because of data that attackers
already have on people.

235
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,000
And during that period
of time, since 2018,

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,470
we thought 200% rise in breaches

237
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,640
that resulted in credential spills.

238
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,189
So now credential stuffing is
the number one attack type.

239
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,490
So when we're talking about risk,

240
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,440
and we're talking about a shift

241
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,370
from inadvertent configuration errors

242
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,580
to inherent vulnerabilities,

243
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,430
targeting access related services,

244
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,819
because they already have credentials,

245
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,670
that's the biggest risk

246
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,810
that all companies have to face right now.

247
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,359
It's the primary way that
they're getting breached.

248
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,089
- And that's scary, because, I mean,

249
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,050
between automation and scripts

250
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,790
and being able to leverage
technology, right?

251
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,400
Attackers can just go crazy

252
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,620
against those kinds of services, right?

253
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,900
Dan, you have an interesting
story about that, don't you?

254
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,660
About learning more
about that whole scene?

255
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,290
The deeper, darker end of the pool?

256
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,500
- Well, I think the best
way to describe the tools

257
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,250
that attackers use is to talk
about how attackers evolve

258
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,080
from low sophistication
to a high sophistication,

259
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,250
and then all the way to human click farms.

260
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,240
So they'll typically start using tools

261
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,280
like (indistinct)

262
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,780
which they're not browsers.

263
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,100
They just replicate the network traffic

264
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,550
that a browser generates.

265
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,991
So there are no mouse movements,

266
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:15,056
there're no keystrokes,

267
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,560
but they're able to fool origin

268
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,829
into thinking they're an actual browser,

269
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,490
because the network traffic is identical.

270
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,430
And these are capable of
launching huge, large volume,

271
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,209
large velocity attacks

272
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,610
in the billions in a day
or two in the billions.

273
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,180
So very, very significant
volumes of attack.

274
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,920
These are also pretty easy to defeat.

275
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,979
A simple JavaScript challenge

276
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,010
will defeat all of those
network layer tools.

277
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,490
And then when you mitigate

278
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,120
based on some attribute that
the attacker can change.

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,800
In other words, now by IP
address or user agent or region

280
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,579
or autonomous system,
those sorts of things.

281
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,850
Then they need to evolve.

282
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,750
They need to become more sophisticated.

283
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,270
And typically what we
see them do is use tools

284
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,600
like headless browsers or
MIT secure or selenium.

285
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,270
So these are real browsers

286
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,300
that are being
programmatically controlled.

287
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,132
And in the beginning,

288
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,070
they're not very good
at impersonating humans.

289
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,020
Maybe the mouse movements of keystrokes

290
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,310
are very synthetic, maybe
too fast to be human,

291
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,510
or the mouse is moving in a straight line.

292
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,840
Again, if they're mitigated
and those attacks fail...

293
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
By the way, if they're successful,

294
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,219
then they don't evolve anymore.

295
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,070
There's just no reason
to invest in tooling

296
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,230
if your attack is successful.

297
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,050
But Shape, we don't block by attributes

298
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,699
that attackers can change very quickly.

299
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,700
So we see them evolve more.

300
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,320
They get much better at
impersonating humans.

301
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,210
There's a lot of entropy

302
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,730
in their mouse movements and keystrokes.

303
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,100
They're better at spoofing devices.

304
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,770
So for example, maybe
the user agent string

305
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,500
purports to be a Samsung device.

306
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,230
Well, in the beginning

307
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,440
they just purport to be a Samsung device,

308
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,170
but they're not doing floating point math

309
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,270
like a Samsung device,

310
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,920
they're not rendering emojis
like a Samsung device.

311
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,780
So we can tell that they're spoofing.

312
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,850
But over time, as these attacks
continue to get mitigated,

313
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,700
they get more and more sophisticated.

314
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,580
Much, much better at spoofing
devices and imitating humans.

315
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,252
And then ultimately when
none of those attacks work,

316
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,250
they resort to human click farms.

317
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,660
So that's how attackers evolve

318
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,270
from low sophistication
network level attacks

319
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,540
through headless browsers,

320
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,829
remotely controlling, actual browsers,

321
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,063
and then all the way to human click farms.

322
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:32,900
- Well, one thing I
didn't hear in any of that

323
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,530
was any discussion about 2FA, right?

324
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,589
We hear about 2FA all the time.

325
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,910
It's even in video games, right?

326
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,730
2FA Fortnite actually
entices everyone, right?

327
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,440
They reward you for enabling 2FA

328
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,770
by giving you some kind of
free digital content in game,

329
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,540
which gets kids used to using 2FA.

330
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,189
So isn't 2FA the solution then
to defeating the click farms,

331
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,190
or the people trying to pretend
to be someone they're not?

332
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
Sara, do you have any insights on that?

333
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,333
Why is 2FA not working?

334
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,849
- I think Dan has a great example...

335
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,970
Has a great answer for
that specific question.

336
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,870
I think for the most part,

337
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,910
2FA is still a very valuable control

338
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,480
in your multi-layer
defense strategy, right?

339
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,313
Defense in depth.

340
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:27,500
You've got to have lots
of different controls

341
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,470
to deal with various forms
of access related attacks.

342
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,740
We know the sophisticated
actors can bypass 2FA.

343
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,510
I still think from...

344
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,960
It doesn't mean get rid of 2FA,

345
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,110
it means we need to evolve

346
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,880
how we deal with access control at scale.

347
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,500
We need to get rid of
username and passwords.

348
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,110
I think a lot of us have ideas
about how we need to evolve

349
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,610
access control as a whole
across the internet.

350
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,550
I think we still have
some valuable controls,

351
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,449
2FA is one of them.

352
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,140
But let's not kid ourselves,

353
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,385
advanced attackers can get around it.

354
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:57,639
But, Dan, I know you have
some specific examples here-

355
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,472
- Yeah.

356
00:14:58,472 --> 00:14:59,370
I agree with you, Sara,

357
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,940
that it does play a very
important role in security,

358
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,880
but widespread and mandatory use of 2FA,

359
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,580
I think is just a bit
burdensome on customers,

360
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,240
especially the elderly.

361
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Now, with our government
using common access cards,

362
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
there's a cost associated

363
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,410
with distributing and maintaining those,

364
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,300
replacing lost ones.

365
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,780
But using a hardware or software token 2FA

366
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,310
will present credential stuffing.

367
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,280
There's no doubt about it.

368
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,579
Now, most implementations of 2FA,

369
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,560
however, I see are text
message and email based.

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,900
And Lori, as you alluded to,

371
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,410
we are seeing bad actors

372
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,300
circumvent that by a variety of means,

373
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,859
whether it be as a certain compromise,

374
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,100
social engineering port outs or SIM swaps,

375
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,970
or malware on cell phones.

376
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,030
They are seriously targeting

377
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,380
those sorts of applications
that are 2FA protected.

378
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,890
And those implementations, by the way,

379
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,939
they don't stop credential stuffing

380
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,140
because when you enter in

381
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,660
the correct username and password,

382
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,030
then and only then are you asked

383
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,280
to enter the second
factor of authentication.

384
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,790
If you enter in the incorrect
username and password,

385
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,860
you're told incorrect
username and password.

386
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,740
So that difference in server
response tells the attacker

387
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,760
whether or not the credentials are good.

388
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,530
Now, admittedly, they haven't
taken over the account,

389
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,770
but they now know the
credentials are good,

390
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,970
and then can partner with
somebody who specializes in

391
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,420
defeating that second
factor of authentication.

392
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,319
So yes, 2FA plays an
important role in security.

393
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,340
It always will.

394
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,900
But at Shape, we like to make sure

395
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,630
our customers are using it
very sparingly, when necessary,

396
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,130
for high-risk transactions

397
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,560
rather than for every transaction,

398
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,910
because it just creates too much friction.

399
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,611
- Yeah, I agree. Totally.

400
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,680
That's your inadvertent information

401
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,477
disclosure vulnerability there,
Dan, you're talking about.

402
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,699
I mean, I think it has diminishing value

403
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,210
when you start using
2FA for customer logins,

404
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,170
especially at scale,

405
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,699
and especially dealing with

406
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,560
the general population
of internet consumers

407
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,920
that are gonna struggle with it.

408
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,399
I think it has diminishing returns.

409
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,310
I think everybody would argue

410
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,919
that 2FA is still a good control

411
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,240
for network access and employee access,

412
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,119
remote access, right?

413
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,280
But I totally agree with you.

414
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,359
It's got diminishing returns

415
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,919
from a consumer access control standpoint.

416
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,030
And that's an opportunity

417
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,670
for this industry to innovate for sure.

418
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,550
And I think we've got
some room for innovation

419
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,909
when we look at the attack landscape

420
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,650
shifting its attacker innovation,

421
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,030
not necessarily us getting
better at defending,

422
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,879
with the exception of new
modern AI enabled controls,

423
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,323
for instance, Shape.

424
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,113
- Yeah.

425
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:36,960
In fact, we like to refer to it

426
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,370
as continuous authentication,

427
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,479
rather than there just be this gate

428
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,180
where the entrant is a
username and password,

429
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,520
2FA code, and they are "authenticated."

430
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,700
We like to continuously authenticate it

431
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,909
using many of the signals we collect.

432
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,960
That is a frictionless way

433
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,350
at providing a comparable
level of security.

434
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,183
- Absolutely.

435
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,487
Zero trust principle.

436
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,280
- Yeah, that's a good point.

437
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,230
Zero trust, and the frictionless, right?

438
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,360
That's part of why 2FA is so
difficult for some people.

439
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,979
Either they don't have a phone
or they can't figure it out.

440
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,940
They can't get to their email.

441
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,910
It can be frustrating
even just to use that

442
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,370
as a mechanism to prove who you are.

443
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,379
But I mean, capture...

444
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,020
We don't capture doesn't work, right?

445
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,330
So if 2FA isn't working, I mean,

446
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,580
enterprises have to do something
to protect against this.

447
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,699
So what is your advice, right?

448
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,550
If you're an enterprise,

449
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,520
how do you evolve your security

450
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,810
to meet some of these modern,
sophisticated attacks?

451
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,159
And if not get ahead,

452
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,410
at least try and keep up and
protect your customers, right?

453
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,180
Because the data is really important.

454
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,690
We've all been compromised,

455
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,290
but there's still a lot of data

456
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,030
that hasn't been compromised.

457
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,510
What can we do to keep that safe?

458
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,530
- Well, Lori, real quick.

459
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,700
You mentioned in passing

460
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,200
that we all know capture doesn't work.

461
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,930
But I think many people in the audience

462
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,223
think capture does work.

463
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,530
- For who, Dan? For who?

464
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,859
- Correct them.

465
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:04,839
Tell us why it doesn't work.

466
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,018
- It doesn't work for me.

467
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:08,223
I'll tell you that.

468
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:10,072
I can't pass one of them, damn chess.

469
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,460
- And neither could I, but
I I've gotten better at it.

470
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,310
I actually went to work for
a Russian human click farm

471
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,350
known as Two Capture.

472
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,409
I went through their training,

473
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,110
and they give you a test

474
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,600
to make sure you can solve
captures quickly enough.

475
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,860
And I almost wasn't hired,

476
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,340
I almost could not solve
the captures quickly enough,

477
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,740
but thankfully, my 16-year-old daughter

478
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,020
helped me solve a few of the captures.

479
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,853
And I was hired.

480
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,420
And I started solving captures for...

481
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,080
I believe probably for people

482
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,980
who are using automation
to circumvent capture.

483
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,520
So I was the human solving those captures.

484
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,430
I had solved maybe, I don't know, 15, 20,

485
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,890
maybe 30 of them, I don't remember.

486
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,303
And I hadn't even earned one penny US yet.

487
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,700
So these are really...

488
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,813
They exploit impoverished regions,

489
00:19:56,813 --> 00:20:00,350
low-income folks who are just gonna work

490
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,969
10, 15-hour days and make
$3 US, it's really tragic.

491
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,950
But as long as there are humans

492
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,960
that are willing to sit
in front of a computer,

493
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,910
or on their phone all day
long and solve captures...

494
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,340
And this is all form of captures.

495
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,770
The squiggly lines, the
purported so-called fun capture,

496
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,000
where you're turning a
reel the right side up,

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,950
or you're clicking, "I'm not a robot."

498
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,920
Every single capture can be defeated...

499
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,740
Well, maybe defeated
isn't even the right word.

500
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,980
I mean, these are humans
solving the captures.

501
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,800
These are actually
humans working for bots.

502
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,633
But anyway,

503
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,830
when I realized that I hadn't
earned that much money,

504
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,080
I decided to quit, and I
haven't solved captures again.

505
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,669
But it was an interesting experience.

506
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,170
And they did teach me

507
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,540
how to solve captures more effectively.

508
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,050
So I think I'm up to like 70% solve rate,

509
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,399
which is much, much better.

510
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,230
(laughs)

511
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,263
- I love that story.

512
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,810
Moral to the story is that,

513
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,460
capture works for attackers
not for legitimate humans.

514
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,293
- Yeah.

515
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,716
My blood boils every time I
encounter one of these captures,

516
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,400
and I click "I'm not a robot."

517
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,650
And then it's asking me to
pick out the fire hydrants

518
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,250
or crosswalks from pictures.

519
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,880
I just, I don't get it.

520
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,790
I wish everybody would just
stop using all forms of capture.

521
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,950
And frankly, our Shape customers do.

522
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,664
We go in line, we deploy our signals,

523
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:22,190
we can prevent the unwanted automation,

524
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,973
without imposing that sort
of friction on customers.

525
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,473
- Yeah.

526
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:31,906
And we just finished a research project,

527
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,020
with Dan's team at Shape,

528
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,030
where we analyzed how
credential stuffing...

529
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,580
Well, Dan's team analyze how
credential stuffing attacks,

530
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,899
play out in the different types
of tools that attackers use.

531
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,560
And we analyze the landscape,

532
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,210
around credential stuffing breaches,

533
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,900
and what attackers are
doing with the credentials.

534
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,780
One of the most fascinating
things to me was that,

535
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,560
attackers are using
compromised credentials,

536
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,909
to log into web applications.

537
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,960
At the same time the legitimate consumers,

538
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,010
are using those same
compromised credentials.

539
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,080
And so you have this little
bit of good guy, bad guy war,

540
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,360
who can get in first,

541
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,969
who's gonna pass the capture.

542
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,330
And if we think about the
likelihood of the legitimate human

543
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,870
passing that versus the attacker.

544
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,216
It's just another example

545
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:18,122
of where they're a little
bit outpacing the good guys.

546
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,229
- It's terrifying to
think about it, right?

547
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,380
We're playing catch up all the time.

548
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,240
And I know that my own research, right?

549
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,133
At a very high level is that,

550
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:37,133
the fastest growing use of
AI right now is in security,

551
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,980
to protect applications.

552
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,726
And I think some of the
stories you've told,

553
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,990
the failures and the successes,

554
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,710
and how attackers evolve
is one of the reasons why.

555
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,350
Is because the amount of data

556
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,030
that you need to analyze
at any given moment,

557
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,139
in order to say attacker legitimate,

558
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,660
is so significant that really as a human,

559
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,290
it's nearly impossible to do.

560
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,430
So, is that the future?

561
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,550
Is that what enterprises need to do next,

562
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,930
in order to make that
next step of security?

563
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,220
Or are there other solutions,

564
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,900
are there other tools they can use,

565
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,180
that will help them improve
their security right now?

566
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,580
- Well, I'm a bit biased.

567
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,340
I know there are companies that purport

568
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,649
they can protect enterprises

569
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,140
just by looking at the network layer,

570
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,093
looking at the IP address
and the autonomous system.

571
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,160
I've seen too many attackers,

572
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,360
evolve right past those sorts of defenses.

573
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,290
I think the only way
to be truly effective,

574
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,350
against some of the more
sophisticated attackers,

575
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,899
is to collect signals from the device,

576
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,480
from the user, from the
network, from the environment,

577
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,653
and then analyze those
signals in real time.

578
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,420
That's really key.

579
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,540
You gotta look at behavioral
biometrics, whether or not...

580
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,707
I mentioned this earlier
but it's worth repeating.

581
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,560
Looking at how the device
does floating point math.

582
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,610
That is a signal we develop years ago,

583
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,000
that's been extremely
effective and powerful

584
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,340
in identifying attackers.

585
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,280
Many of these attackers,

586
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,310
they have no idea how
to spoof such a signal.

587
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,050
So, we've used that very effectively,

588
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,490
to track many, many attackers.

589
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,670
So yeah, I think
collecting signals is key.

590
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,040
And then I guess the second thing

591
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,350
that's really, really important,

592
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,540
that a lot of enterprises
overlook is attackers retool.

593
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,520
So, you have to have a second stage,

594
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,820
your real-time defense
looking at the signals,

595
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,040
but a second stage that is looking at

596
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,430
the last five minutes of transactions,

597
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,350
or the last 30 minutes, the
last hour, the last day.

598
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,969
Looking at aggregate transactions
using your AI, ML systems,

599
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,070
just to look for any malicious traffic

600
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,928
that stage one missed.

601
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,250
If you don't have stage two,
that retrospective analysis,

602
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,280
looking at those signals,

603
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,190
then you're gonna miss a lot of retools.

604
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,540
And then I guess the final thing is

605
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,340
if you identify something in stage two,

606
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,510
you of course need stage one,

607
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,290
without impacting production or traffic.

608
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,710
So that's really the key.

609
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,570
Collecting rich signals,

610
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,230
taking real-time action
in what we call stage one,

611
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,990
and then having AI and ML systems
running in the background,

612
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,670
on aggregate transactions,

613
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,150
looking for anything
that stage one missed,

614
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,530
then update stage one
with a new countermeasure,

615
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,470
and that continues into perpetuity.

616
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,780
If you really want to be effective,

617
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,393
against the motivated and
sophisticated attackers.

618
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,929
- I totally agree with Dan.

619
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,180
And what I'm hearing you say, Dan,

620
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,570
is knowing your environment, right?

621
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,159
That is supposed to be our advantage.

622
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,640
We are supposed to know our environments

623
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,580
better than attackers,

624
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,110
and be in a more advantageous
position to defend.

625
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,939
And I think that's a big part

626
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,890
of a defender's challenge right now.

627
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,790
Because when you talk about network,

628
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,707
and some of the ways that
other security providers

629
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,300
offer defense, especially
at a network level,

630
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,520
what is your network anymore, right?

631
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,040
You've got systems way
outside of your ASN,

632
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,963
because you're in multi-cloud, right?

633
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,840
That's part of your network,

634
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
it's where your systems
and your data exists,

635
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,700
and it's not gonna be under
the protection of a perimeter,

636
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,050
that you manage anymore, right?

637
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,669
Well, I guess you do manage
the perimeter of systems

638
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,140
in the cloud but that's a huge challenge.

639
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,900
It's actually the primary root cause

640
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,780
of breaches in the cloud,

641
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,780
is a lack of access control
in general to cloud systems.

642
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,972
So exposed ECQ buckets with
no access control at all.

643
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:27,120
No requirement for authorization.

644
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,080
Nothing, right?

645
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,540
So, I think that's a big challenge.

646
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,220
And I think when you look
at the attacker landscape,

647
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,220
they're really good at scale
because they use automation.

648
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,340
And the only way to defend against that,

649
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,740
is to do the same.

650
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,090
Automation and scale
with security control.

651
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,490
I think we do need to...

652
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,820
We have some room for innovation.

653
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,220
I think access control

654
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,460
is probably the biggest
area of opportunity,

655
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,550
in terms of security at scale.

656
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,550
We've got to figure out a way
to make zero trust deployable.

657
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,530
It's been widely
discussed as best practice

658
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,310
since Google championed
it, almost 12 years ago.

659
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,620
And we're still in
relatively immature phases

660
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,580
of deploying access,

661
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,360
or zero trust programs across
enterprises around the world.

662
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,780
And so, I think it's security at scale.

663
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,210
It's leveraging AI and
automation to help with that,

664
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,510
understanding your environment,

665
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,840
tuning custom signatures
to your environment,

666
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,340
if you don't use solutions like

667
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,403
Shaper, SAS solutions, right?

668
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,460
And it's adopting more
cultures of security, right?

669
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,700
There's a lot of things you can do,

670
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,350
from a defensive standpoint
with security controls,

671
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,100
but you can also start from within.

672
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,570
Developing products
securely from the get-go,

673
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,669
training your developers on secure coding,

674
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,310
adopting a culture of security,

675
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,169
talking about the value of security more.

676
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,160
So, we're not still having
these conversations,

677
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,610
about why security is important,

678
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,090
because when you talk to a
security person, you're like,

679
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,260
"What do you mean there's
breaches everywhere,

680
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,980
and you shouldn't trust
your own identity anymore."

681
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,880
And you're still fighting that fight,

682
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,800
of trying to articulate the
value of security to a business.

683
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,440
And so I know I threw out a lot of things,

684
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,730
but if I could sum up my recommendations,

685
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,963
it's go for zero trust, go
for automation and scale.

686
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,510
Go for vendors that
have AI and automation,

687
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,830
that you trust that have
very intelligent teams

688
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,350
like yourself, Dan.

689
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,409
Better powering those controls,

690
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,903
and train your developers
on secure coding.

691
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,469
- A couple of things you said, Sara,

692
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,790
reminds me of a couple of things,

693
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,290
that are probably be
important to the audience.

694
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,110
Look, AI and ML is important,

695
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,169
but it's almost become a buzz phrase.

696
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,540
Frankly, I hear vendors
use and overuse it.

697
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,280
If they could just throw in blockchain

698
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,530
it would be the trifecta.

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,810
In reality, Shape is actually
quite good at AI and ML,

700
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,100
we're in the top 100 the
world according to Fortune.

701
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,860
We continue to invest tens of
millions of dollars into it.

702
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,780
And we recognize that it isn't
ready to be blindly trusted

703
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,240
in making real time decisions
about whether or not

704
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,920
to take a mitigating
action on a transaction.

705
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,010
It just isn't ready to be blindly trusted.

706
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,850
You need humans, lots of humans

707
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,709
pouring over all those alerts,

708
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,540
looking for false positives,
looking for false negatives,

709
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,300
making sure those systems
are learning appropriately.

710
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,680
So that's one thing I
wanted the audience to hear.

711
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,460
When you hear vendors
throw around AI and ML,

712
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,170
just roll your eyes unless
they have dozens of humans,

713
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,700
to support that AI and ML.

714
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,720
So that's really key.

715
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,330
And then the other thing is

716
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,590
Sara, you mentioned know your environment.

717
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,639
Something that is very important is that,

718
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,730
attacks are not just against login today.

719
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,520
Yes, that's the kind of the
big daddy of them all, right?

720
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,440
Credential stuffing and login,

721
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,080
but we are seeing unwanted automation,

722
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,800
against virtually every
public facing application,

723
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,770
against forgot password,
against create account.

724
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,730
We see fair scraping.

725
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,100
We see attacks against the

726
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,572
check gift card balance application.

727
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,773
Every single public facing application,

728
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:10,673
is under some sort of an
attack or unwanted automation.

729
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,750
And when it comes to login it

730
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,160
isn't just the consumer logins,

731
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,720
it's the employee logins,
it's the partner logins,

732
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,244
the vendor logins.

733
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:22,310
So, knowing your environment,

734
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,570
knowing which applications
are vulnerable to attack,

735
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,450
is the first step in
deploying countermeasures.

736
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,770
You have to know where to look

737
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,040
to see the unwanted automation.

738
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,080
And by the way,

739
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,610
this automation, it's coming not from

740
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,750
a dozen or a hundred IP addresses.

741
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,350
These attacks are coming
from millions of IP addresses

742
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,870
from all over the world.

743
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,060
It's really easy to come from

744
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,750
a very, very distributed
attack infrastructure.

745
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,900
And I've noticed security
operation centers

746
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,010
are quite good at identifying...

747
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,730
I don't know, the top few
thousand noisiest IPS,

748
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,080
but they miss the long tail of
hundreds of thousands of IPS,

749
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,149
even millions of IPS

750
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,510
from which there are only
10 or 15 transactions.

751
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,740
And typically, the majority of the attack,

752
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,330
is coming from that long tail.

753
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,720
So just a couple of things

754
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,583
I wanted to mention that Sara reminded me.

755
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,260
- Awesome. Awesome.

756
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,670
What I hear is something that
I've said for a long time,

757
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,670
which is you can't stop an attack,

758
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,250
because you don't control the person

759
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,530
that's launching the attack.

760
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,320
The only thing you can
do is identify it, right?

761
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,710
Stop it from doing any harm,

762
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,040
but it's still gonna come.

763
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,090
And I think that's become
even more true over the years.

764
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,300
Assume you are going to be attacked,

765
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
and then really zero in,

766
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,760
in order to focus your
security efforts, right?

767
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,970
To maximize what you can do,

768
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,510
to stop those attacks
from being successful.

769
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,343
- Yeah.

770
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,730
And how you mitigate attacks is important.

771
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,580
You don't want to
mitigate attacks in a way,

772
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,830
that the attacker immediately recognized

773
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,350
that he's being mitigated.

774
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,419
All that does is incentivized retools.

775
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,750
You wanna take a mitigating action,

776
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,260
where the attacker doesn't
immediately recognize

777
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,440
that his attack has been
detected and being mitigated.

778
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,210
So, for example if it's on login,

779
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,700
you just want to give the
attacker a failed login page,

780
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,270
because then it looks natural.

781
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,889
He doesn't know that he's being mitigated,

782
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,280
until of course he starts
using Canary accounts,

783
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,889
to know whether or not
he's being mitigated,

784
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,930
but that's typically reserved

785
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,060
for the more sophisticated attackers.

786
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,000
But the key is to mitigate in a way

787
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,110
that they don't immediately recognize,

788
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,889
otherwise they'll just immediately retool.

789
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,919
- I love deception defense,
but that could get us

790
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,691
into a whole another like
20 minutes of conversation.

791
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:39,361
Mess with them if you can.

792
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:42,902
- Exactly. We only have about two minutes.

793
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,900
So maybe another time we'll
have to dive into that,

794
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,570
because this has been a
fascinating conversation.

795
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,490
I've really enjoyed it.

796
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,100
If you just want to take a minute,

797
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,280
and give a last word or
two to everyone listening.

798
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,473
That'd be great. Dan.

799
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,270
- I guess I just tell everybody,

800
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,330
not just the enterprises
that are listening,

801
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,270
but the individuals
and the family members,

802
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,970
and the friends and loved ones,

803
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,480
never reuse your passwords ever.

804
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,720
There's just no reason for it,

805
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,090
Always...

806
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,290
Maybe use a password manager,

807
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,440
where you just have to remember

808
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,460
one really, really strong password,

809
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,710
and all the other
passwords are very strong.

810
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,630
You don't have to remember them,

811
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,750
you just copy and paste them
into the password field.

812
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,554
So if I were to give
any advice to anybody,

813
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:29,050
tell you, your friends, your
family use a password manager,

814
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,800
'cause it's gonna save you
a lot of pain in the future.

815
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,370
- Awesome, Dan.
- Yes, please.

816
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,860
It'll go a long way in improving

817
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,780
the overall health of the internet.

818
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,260
It is an ecosystem that
we all depend upon.

819
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,200
And again, in my conversation
about how breaches occur.

820
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,670
The majority of breaches are now occurring

821
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,330
through access related attacks,

822
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,540
because it's your
internet neighbors breach,

823
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,379
where credentials were collected,

824
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,660
those credentials were shared

825
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,750
against applications that you own.

826
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,840
And that's how you got breached

827
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,020
from your internet neighbors breach.

828
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,583
This is really an ecosystem.

829
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,460
And it matters to business,

830
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,000
and it matters to your personal
privacy and your identity.

831
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,740
And it doesn't matter
if you're a US person,

832
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,423
with a social security
number or somebody in Europe.

833
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,409
This is impacting everybody's
personal identity,

834
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,540
as much as it's driving
up the cost of products,

835
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,880
because businesses are
eating the cost of breaches.

836
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,659
So this is super, super, super important.

837
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,739
I love talking to the consumer space too.

838
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,819
And I think we all as security
professionals have a role,

839
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,070
to talk about the value of security,

840
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,210
and share that information
with our friends and family,

841
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,020
and try to get consumers to
have better internet hygiene,

842
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,210
especially with password saves.

843
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,270
And I think that'll go a long way,

844
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,889
and selling security internally too,

845
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,815
because businesses will
see it as more valuable.

846
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:43,648
- Absolutely.

847
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,300
That's always a good point, right?

848
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,010
One of the best reasons
to educate consumers,

849
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,929
is because consumers are
also employees, right?

850
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,270
So really there's no difference.

851
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,150
We all need to go out right now,

852
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,860
and just change our passwords,

853
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,340
make sure they're all correct.

854
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,280
Do a little audit and get that going.

855
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,670
And so I wanna thank
you for that reminder.

856
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,780
I also wanna thank you both,

857
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,220
for being on this panel,

858
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,720
and giving us such
interesting perspectives,

859
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,899
and stories and information and advice.

860
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
It's been really valuable.

861
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,050
I've enjoyed it.

862
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,450
I hope everybody watching has enjoyed it,

863
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,299
and learned something,

864
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,120
and taken something away from it

865
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,319
that you can use right tomorrow,

866
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,830
or right now to start better security.

867
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,049
I guess you do better security, right?

868
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,040
It's something you do.

869
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,710
It's not something we just talk about.

870
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,954
So, thank you everyone.

871
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,142
- Thank you everyone.

872
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:35,975
- Yeah. Thank you.

873
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:38,058
Thank you for joining us.
