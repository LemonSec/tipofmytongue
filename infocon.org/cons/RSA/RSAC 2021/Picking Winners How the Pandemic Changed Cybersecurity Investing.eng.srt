1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,480
- Good afternoon, good evening everyone.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,400
From Princeton, New Jersey, I'm Rob Sloan.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,498
I'm research director at
WSJ Pro the professional arm

4
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:10,479
of The Wall Street Journal.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
Hope you're all enjoying this
year's virtual RSA event.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,110
And while it's a shame

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,950
we don't all get to meet
together in San Francisco,

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,570
it does mean that we get to enjoy all

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,450
of the fantastic content from
the comfort of our homes.

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,250
This session is, "Picking Winners:

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,900
How the Pandemic Changed
Cybersecurity Investing."

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,880
And for the next 30 minutes or so,

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,939
we're going to be analyzing

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,700
how cybersecurity investors
responded to the pandemic,

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,440
what has changed in the
investment landscape since

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,027
and what's top of mind for investors

17
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:41,890
and entrepreneurs in
the Bay Area and beyond.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,160
We'll be guided through
the topic by three experts.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,830
So please join me in welcoming,

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,640
Dino Boukouris, managing
director of Momentum Cyber,

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,080
Dr. Chenxi Wang, founder and
general partner at Rain Capital

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,980
and Saam Motamedi, general
partner at Greylock Partners.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,535
Please remember if you have any questions,

24
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:02,960
you can ask them via the chat function

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,880
and the panelists will
respond in real time.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,898
Please do try and keep
questions short and to the point

27
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,261
so we can get through as
many of those as possible.

28
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,729
We have got a lot to get through,

29
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,510
so I'm going to put my first question

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,085
to Saam to get us started.

31
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:20,039
Saam, take us back to early
2020, just over a year ago.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,950
Were investors better
prepared for the pandemic

33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,960
than other industries and
had individual firms thought

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
about how a pandemic
might affect business?

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,060
- Thanks Rob, and it's a pleasure

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,680
to be here on this panel today.

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,052
So for context at Greylock,

38
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:38,510
we're a small Silicon Valley
based venture capital firm.

39
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,210
We invest primarily in consumer
and enterprise software.

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,482
And so if you think about the companies

41
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:43,770
that we get involved with,

42
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,670
they range from one person and an idea

43
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,270
to a pre IPO stage company with
a couple thousand employees.

44
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,509
And so if you rewind the clock back

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,710
to February, March, 2020,

46
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,193
I think the short answer
to your question, Rob,

47
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:57,764
is we weren't specifically

48
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,672
like sitting inside Greylock thinking

49
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:02,910
about a global pandemic and preparing

50
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,149
for how that would impact
the way we would work

51
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,210
at Greylock or how our
companies would operate

52
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,889
in scale their businesses.

53
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,640
That said, like when we
invest in these companies,

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,070
these journeys are inherently volatile

55
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,200
and part of it is how
do you build robustness

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,030
and antifragility into the company

57
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,724
so that you can react to an uncertain

58
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,850
and unpredictable future?

59
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,390
And so as part of that, like, you know

60
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,119
one thing we do when
we invest in a company

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,860
is we make sure to capitalize the company

62
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,591
not just to the next set of milestones,

63
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,720
but so that it has a period of buffer

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,590
in case anything was to happen.

65
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,560
Another thing that I
think we're thankful a lot

66
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,810
of our companies have
been doing pre pandemic,

67
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,960
is experimenting with
different modalities of work.

68
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,490
Whether that was, you know,
one or two days a week,

69
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,260
you know, engineers could work from home

70
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,340
or some companies that had
fully distributed teams

71
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,370
or some companies in the
middle that had an HQ

72
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,925
and satellite offices.

73
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,910
So some of the paradigms that went

74
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,260
from optional to necessity post pandemic,

75
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,040
our companies were already used to, right?

76
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,459
And so, if I think like the
transition post pandemic

77
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,550
that our companies went through,

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,100
I think of it on three dimensions.

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,390
The first dimension is health
and safety of the workforce.

80
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,119
And so, you know, what
we saw happen right away

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,783
and a lot of the companies
I'm personally involved with

82
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:13,839
and we're involved with at
Greylock are Bay Area based,

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,930
and the Bay Area was one
of, was on the early side

84
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,430
of locking down relative
to other major US cities.

85
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,560
We saw, you know, a lot
of offices shut down

86
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,042
and people pretty seamlessly transitioned

87
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,560
to working from home,

88
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,730
especially in our software
oriented companies.

89
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,970
Then the second piece is, okay,
how do you have continuity

90
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,080
of business service and
products for your end customers?

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,790
And again, there, you know,

92
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,109
particularly for a more modern
cloud-based SAS companies,

93
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,430
the transition was pretty seamless.

94
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,640
And then I think the last piece

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,679
and where we spend a lot of time

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
and I'm sure we're going to
talk about it as a group is,

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,100
once you have the defensive
place, how do you play offense?

98
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,350
And so a number of our
companies began to think

99
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,079
through how does the product

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,260
and value proposition stay relevant,

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,310
become more relevant in
a post pandemic world,

102
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,200
and how do you adjust to building

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,727
and scaling and selling
software kind of post pandemic?

104
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:01,360
And that's where we spend
a lot of our energy on,

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,193
but we adopted quickly.

106
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:03,730
It wasn't something we had come

107
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,303
into 2020 thinking about or planning for.

108
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,119
- So fortunately some of those,

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,498
those strengths that you
look for in businesses,

110
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:15,899
just play it out very, very
nicely in this scenario.

111
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,779
And Chenxi, you were saying
just before we started recording

112
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,979
about how sort of carelessly
we all were at RSA last year,

113
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,520
we weren't thinking about lockdowns

114
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,880
or how this pandemic
was going to affect us,

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,777
then a few weeks later
the lockdowns are there.

116
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,810
I imagine it was quite stressful

117
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,170
for you with all of the unknowns.

118
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,610
You know, what were you thinking

119
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,553
about how you and your firm would respond?

120
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,622
- Yes, thank you for that and
pleasure to be here as well.

121
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:48,150
I think it was similar for our firm

122
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,710
as what Saam said, right?

123
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,739
So we weren't necessarily
preparing for a global pandemic

124
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,380
but just the fact that we
are in software industry,

125
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,380
my firms, my companies mostly
are SAS based offerings

126
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,420
and the switching to work
from home wasn't a big deal,

127
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,280
wasn't a big switch for these companies.

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,739
And their business model was,

129
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,250
many of the business models
were inherently resilient

130
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,600
against a pandemic sort of world, right?

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,810
So I would say overall, we
weren't impacted that much.

132
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,200
But we did in the
beginning of the pandemic,

133
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,420
like March, April, I think
everybody saw a slow down

134
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,490
in business, right?

135
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,230
And because customers
are suddenly switching

136
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,500
to work from home and some
of the strategic projects

137
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,230
are being postponed.

138
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,900
All the IT and security teams
have to now pay attention

139
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,030
to how to secure work from home.

140
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,515
So there are, I would say places

141
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:55,620
where you have to quickly
switch your strategy

142
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,430
how to accommodate what customers want.

143
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,070
But beyond that, I think we actually,

144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,290
I saw a very resilient set

145
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,710
of companies that came out of pandemic.

146
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,568
Well, I guess we're not
completely out yet, right?

147
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,780
But 2020 actually, I was super impressed

148
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,037
at how resilient everybody was.

149
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,560
The companies that we invested in,

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,070
came out to 2020 very strong,

151
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,140
and in fact, five of my
companies raised to Series B

152
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,460
in Q1 this year based on
strong performance of 2020.

153
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,460
So I for one, was pleasantly surprised.

154
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,793
- That's great.

155
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,610
So I actually, I'm going
to come to you Dino now

156
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,520
to talk about some of those numbers

157
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,320
and how the industry performed in general.

158
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,050
And I'm assuming a lot of the
audience might be familiar

159
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,923
with Momentum Cyber from the data

160
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,650
that they put out regularly
and the cyber scape

161
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,409
which I've loved following
for years as those logos

162
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,993
have got smaller and smaller on the slide.

163
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,550
Tell us a little bit about
what it looked like in 2020.

164
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,240
I mean, I know quarter
one was really good,

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,303
quarter two, there's all these unknowns,

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,590
funding dries up and then what happens?

167
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,530
Tell us what do we need to know

168
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,109
as the year went on and as
this year has progressed.

169
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,943
- Yeah, sure.

170
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,873
And likewise, great, great to be here

171
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,130
with an excellent panel.

172
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,930
And then I think a lot of the comments

173
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,487
are in line with what Saam
and Chenxi were saying.

174
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:36,990
And what we saw really was,
yes, Q1 was a strong quarter.

175
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,970
I would say in March, of
course, is when things,

176
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,750
you know, just came to a screeching halt.

177
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,870
At least from our perspective, it was more

178
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,690
of like a period of pause and uncertainty.

179
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,060
So there was that, there
was that defensive mindset

180
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,817
almost like a survival
mindset that a lot of,

181
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,242
you know, a lot of investors
and companies went into.

182
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,550
And, you know, yes, there were

183
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,180
I'd say a handful of deals that, you know,

184
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,610
at least we were aware of that were,

185
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,850
you know, right at the point
where they wanted to close.

186
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,860
So maybe like the 20, 10 yard line

187
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,953
to use a football analogy here.

188
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,929
Those deals for the most part

189
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,633
either got across the goal line as papered

190
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,500
or there were some
retrades that just happened

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,610
to be in my opinion,

192
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,192
just really unluckily timed at that point.

193
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,970
But right after April, I'd say that,

194
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,380
that uncertainty started to dissipate,

195
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,580
people went into more, okay,
the shock has worn off,

196
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,740
lets go into action mode.

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,190
Let's get our companies working from home,

198
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,870
let's get our business
processes up and running,

199
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,660
business continuity was back.

200
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,524
You know, Q2 was a bit slower
I think across the board.

201
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:36,360
There just wasn't, because the deals

202
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,039
that obviously would be announced in Q2,

203
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,349
they would have to be in full swing

204
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,890
in March and April timeframe,
that wasn't really the case.

205
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,870
You know, deals that we were
involved in for example,

206
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,190
none of them actually went away.

207
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,910
They ended up just kind
of getting stretched

208
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,390
and getting a little bit slow rolled.

209
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,212
So meetings were happening,
I'd say maybe more meetings

210
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:55,020
than we would've expected were happening.

211
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,310
So lots of activity,

212
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,852
even though it didn't
necessarily translate

213
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,949
into accomplishment in
that second quarter.

214
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,800
Q3, we actually saw,
you know, a resurgence.

215
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,128
The tides really felt
like they were shifting,

216
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,350
I mean, our own business, we
started seeing more companies

217
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,560
that were thinking about going out

218
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,710
and raising the next round of capital,

219
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:14,130
thinking about potential
M&A opportunities.

220
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,830
So, you know, Q3, things started

221
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,880
to feel like we were
already seeing the light

222
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,700
at the end of the tunnel,
even though, you know,

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,340
we're still just in 90 days,
120 days into the pandemic.

224
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,997
Q4, you know, at least
for us we were seeing

225
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:30,810
the market and activity in full swing.

226
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,439
I mean, there's record numbers
that ended up getting posted.

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,810
From a financing perspective, you know,

228
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,939
we made more investments
in cyber security in 2020

229
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,960
than we did in 2019.

230
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,150
There's actually about a 28% increase.

231
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,093
We have about 540
investments that we tracked

232
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:50,650
in the cybersecurity market
versus 420 the year before.

233
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,829
And then if you look at the
money that went into the space

234
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,830
it was almost $11 billion
that went into the market,

235
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,360
and I think the year
before we did about nine.

236
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,810
So from a kind of cash and deal velocity

237
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,099
in cybersecurity in particular,

238
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,653
we were actually quite
pleasantly surprised.

239
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,413
- I think I'm right in saying

240
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:11,936
it wasn't just cybersecurity, right?

241
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:15,920
The whole VC funding
across most industries,

242
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,413
bounced right back and
had had fantastic years.

243
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,689
- Yeah, I think overall you're right.

244
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,870
Q4 was probably that determining factor.

245
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,890
For the industries that
had a really strong Q4,

246
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,390
it was able to kind of
push them across that line.

247
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,310
Otherwise maybe, you know, if
they weren't better than 2019,

248
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,520
they were just, you know,
approaching that line.

249
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,270
So I think, you know, we saw
that recovery just like we did

250
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,199
in the public markets.

251
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,590
I mean, I think the private
markets really did follow

252
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,150
the public markets quite
closely as, you know,

253
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,780
the markets were red hot kind of going

254
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,000
into the end of last year,

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,453
I mean, we saw VC funding flowing too.

256
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:53,500
- Saam, Chenxi, you know,
you're seeing the data

257
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,660
of a strong recovery in Q3,

258
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,092
is that giving you confidence to go out

259
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,771
and do more deals yourself

260
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:04,070
or is every investor sort
of approaching this on

261
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,570
a personal risk tolerance level?

262
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,330
I don't feel, I don't think

263
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,150
we're through the worst of this yet,

264
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,084
how are you approaching this?

265
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,022
Chenxi, maybe I could put that to you.

266
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,630
- I don't think I'm necessarily
approaching it differently

267
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,420
because there was a pandemic
or was a strong year.

268
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,937
I'm approaching it just
the same I was before,

269
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:30,463
you know, rigorous,
looking at good companies,

270
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,922
solving compelling
problems with good teams

271
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:36,690
and things that I could help with, right?

272
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,750
So those are the summary,

273
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,169
the criteria that I use
to evaluate companies

274
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,310
and I do the same today.

275
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,739
And I would say that one
thing has changed is,

276
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,470
I'm much more likely to fund a company

277
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,527
without meeting the founders in person now

278
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,910
and that has been a change.

279
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,850
- And that's something I
do want to get to later.

280
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,160
Just a reminder to
everyone in the audience,

281
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,409
don't forget panelist will
be answering your questions

282
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:06,089
in real time, so if you have
anything you want to ask them,

283
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,000
write it right there in the chat box,

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,803
hit, Submit, and we'll get to it.

285
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:16,300
Saam, what challenges does working

286
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,319
from home and family bring for you?

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,370
So for me personally it means,

288
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,760
I have three kids running around

289
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,003
and I'm trying to do
homeschooling at the same time

290
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,015
as work for the journal.

291
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:28,363
It's just distracting.

292
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:32,460
I don't know if you have family
there or other distractions,

293
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,570
but just the process
of investing from home

294
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,200
without your workmates, teammates

295
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,250
and data around you on
tap, is it more difficult?

296
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,217
- Yeah, it's a great question.

297
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,630
And I kind of want to
second something Chenxi

298
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,760
just said which is, on the venture side

299
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,301
at some level the job is unchanged, right?

300
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,230
We're, looking for like the intersection

301
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,451
of exceptional people with
exceptional market opportunities.

302
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:56,530
And you know, now we're in
the virtual office on Zoom,

303
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,060
we're not sitting in our in person office,

304
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,359
but like the fundamental mechanic
is actually very similar.

305
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,050
And then I think, you know, Rob,

306
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,770
to your question on what's difficult,

307
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,260
I'll start with, what's not difficult.

308
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,500
So one of the nice things
about the venture business is,

309
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,150
and especially the way
we work at Greylock,

310
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,770
we've always worked in a
somewhat distributed way

311
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,100
which is to say that, you know,
there's eight or nine of us,

312
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,690
we get together on Mondays,

313
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,170
you know, we talk about opportunities

314
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,160
both at a concrete company
level and at a market level.

315
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,520
We make investment decisions

316
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,030
and we spend time together in person.

317
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,959
But then, you know, Tuesday
through Friday, you know,

318
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,090
we're split across multiple offices.

319
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,849
You know, every partner
has a different portfolio,

320
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,700
they're in board meetings and so,

321
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,230
it was not uncommon at all
for me to go an entire week,

322
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,069
you know, module Monday
and not see my partners.

323
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,969
And so to that degree, you know,

324
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,730
minus the fact that now
Mondays are, you know,

325
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,760
an eight hour Zoom
meeting, a lot is unchanged

326
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,980
in the way that we work both
internally and with companies.

327
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,020
I think to Chenxi's point,

328
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,521
there are some nice
positive kind of things

329
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:54,360
that have happened, right?

330
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,490
One is at some level, the
complexity of investing

331
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,630
in an entrepreneur sitting
in New York city, in Chicago,

332
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,007
in Tel Aviv is no harder

333
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,500
than investing in
someone in San Francisco.

334
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,660
And so it's leveled the playing field

335
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,637
from a geographic perspective.

336
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,219
It allows us to see a
new set of opportunities

337
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,720
and a more diverse set of opportunities.

338
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,180
So I'd say that's quite exciting.

339
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,130
You know, the other thing I'd add is,

340
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,176
like the pandemic just
created a lot of opportunity,

341
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,740
it created a lot of pain for companies

342
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,260
in the way they worked, and that also led

343
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,900
to a lot of opportunities
for new companies.

344
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,610
So I think at Greylock, like we would say

345
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,108
we haven't seen the rate of innovation

346
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,040
and the rate of new company creation

347
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,860
that we've seen over the last
nine to 12 months, right?

348
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,270
And I think Satya Nadella
had this famous quote

349
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,020
like early on in the
pandemic when he said,

350
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,850
several years of digital transformation

351
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,000
has gotten compressed into several months.

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
We absolutely saw that play out.

353
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,849
And I think you have all these enterprises

354
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,220
that had these projects
on the security side but,

355
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,620
but on the transformation kind of,

356
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,620
in terms of transformation more generally,

357
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,700
that they were thinking of
as like multi-year projects,

358
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,710
multi quarter projects and
now it's X essential, right?

359
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,550
Like if you want it to
transform the way you interact

360
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,709
with your own customers and
go from a retail presence

361
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,150
to a digital presence, you've
got to do it right away.

362
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,260
And you look to new vendors
and innovative technologies.

363
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,298
So that's kind of one thing
pulling on the demand side.

364
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,460
And then on the supply side, look,

365
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,070
you had a cohort of
companies go public last year

366
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,610
in the technology space.

367
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,520
All the employees at those companies felt

368
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,610
like it was the right
time to transition out.

369
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,810
Those early employees
often become the founders

370
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,410
of the next set of companies,

371
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,430
and so you have like a lot of supply

372
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,356
of new entrepreneurs and
then those things intersect

373
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,920
and create opportunities for us.

374
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,790
And so, while we've like
shifted to working from home,

375
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,065
and Rob, similar to you, like
it's complex with families

376
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,161
and managing kind of work at home,

377
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,439
it's actually been a really exciting time.

378
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,010
In our, for example our, I think
we have never paced as fast

379
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,970
on new investments as we
have over the last 12 months

380
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,680
because of how attractive
the opportunity set is.

381
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,339
- I totally agree.

382
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,386
I would say that other than, you know,

383
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:54,280
the beginning of Q2 slow down,

384
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,793
I saw the number of meetings

385
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:59,740
that I took as pitch
meetings actually increased

386
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,170
the later part of 2020 versus 2019.

387
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,313
And that was a surprise to me,

388
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,261
you know, sitting in March thinking

389
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,100
what's going to happen
the rest of the year,

390
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,965
but it was completely a different story.

391
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:17,421
And the rate of innovation is unheard of

392
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,370
or unseen in previous years.

393
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,348
And I also sit on the
board of a public company

394
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:27,180
where the rate of transformation

395
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,380
the public company is looking
at also has accelerated

396
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,185
because the requirement of having to adopt

397
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:36,069
a different operating model.

398
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,590
And that really changed the way we look

399
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,660
at entrepreneurship and also investment.

400
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,660
So I'm very, actually, I'm
happy with the outcome,

401
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,670
not happy about the pandemic obviously,

402
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,185
but happy with what,

403
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,189
how resilient the industry is,

404
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,530
how resilient the community is.

405
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,086
So that's been a great experience.

406
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,670
- And does that extend beyond the US,

407
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,105
is that the same in Israel and the UK?

408
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:09,310
Are you seeing that innovation everywhere?

409
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,889
- Israel is going crazy. (laughs)

410
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,530
I mean, they just had about,

411
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,530
today a $26 million seed
round of a new company

412
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,240
which has probably the largest
in cyber security, right?

413
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,597
And we, you know, we picked
up a company in India,

414
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:29,940
you know, I've never met
the founders in person

415
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,940
and this is enabled or
accelerated by the need

416
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,523
to do business remotely.

417
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,373
- Well, let's come back

418
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:42,230
to your point then about
meeting founders remotely.

419
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,480
Not being able to press the flesh,

420
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,112
not being able to sit
and look someone in eye

421
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:52,480
over an office desk or a lunch table.

422
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,370
How challenging is that?

423
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,300
You're about to invest money

424
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,060
with someone that you haven't met.

425
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,980
Is that scary the first time you do it?

426
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,990
Chenxi, maybe I can ask you that first.

427
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,275
- So I actually already
did it before, (laughs)

428
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,938
before the pandemic, you know?

429
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,540
It's funny because Saam said,

430
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,360
Oh, Greylock, we're a small fund.

431
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,219
If you're a small, I'm tiny.

432
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,090
And so from where I sit,

433
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,649
I don't have the necessary budget

434
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,190
to travel around the
world to meet everyone.

435
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,590
So, you know, we meet whenever we can.

436
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,929
We meet a lot of folks during RSA,

437
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,030
for instance, during Black Hat.

438
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,270
But on a normal basis, I take
meetings here in the Bay Area

439
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,650
and I also do a lot of Zoom
meetings to begin with.

440
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,480
And I think what happened
during the pandemic

441
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,461
is that we would do a
lot more than meetings.

442
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:48,389
The scale of founders
that I was able to meet

443
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,860
around the world has really
increased and that's the change.

444
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,620
And, and I don't see it
changing going forward.

445
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,958
And I will continue to meet
folks online in addition

446
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,450
to in-person and whenever it's possible

447
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,600
but online will become my primary method

448
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,919
I think of talking to entrepreneurs.

449
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,420
- Dino, similar story for you?

450
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,280
- Yeah. I would say similar.

451
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,810
I mean, from our perspective

452
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,970
I would say when the pandemic kind

453
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,879
of first was really making waves,

454
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:21,438
it was a bit nerve wracking

455
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,710
mainly because we just weren't sure.

456
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,157
I mean, you're looking
at the infection curves

457
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,490
in the various countries,

458
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,000
countries, you know, we're
starting to go into lockdown.

459
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,990
It wasn't really clear
to us kind of how long

460
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,820
would this last and how
would this change things,

461
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
but I would say within a couple of weeks,

462
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,338
we actually, we put out a special report

463
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:40,899
by the end of March, that
really our prediction was,

464
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,870
you know, no pun intended
that cybersecurity

465
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,157
was going to be virus resistant.

466
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,139
You know, we're looking at the trends

467
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,610
of people embracing working from home.

468
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,899
We saw the trends of increased end points

469
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,360
that were being deployed
that needed to be protected.

470
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,840
People that needed to
have secure connectivity

471
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,699
which, yes, there wasn't a, you know,

472
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,377
probably an initial
reaction like an influx

473
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:03,320
of let's say, VPN technologies

474
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,189
and some of these legacy solutions

475
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,000
just to get people connected.

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,650
But we saw the writing on
the wall that, you know,

477
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,770
digital transformation
was going to be forced

478
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,900
to accelerate instead of VPNs.

479
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,290
People are going to
move towards, you know,

480
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,649
some kind of secure connectivity,

481
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,760
sassy type solution like the ZScalers

482
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,918
and iBosses and Catos of the world.

483
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,320
So we kind of saw some of these trends

484
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,246
that we thought were
just going to accelerate

485
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,350
and fortunately they did.

486
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,580
And I would say fortunately most

487
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,520
of the cybersecurity
companies that we spoke with,

488
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,660
they saw tailwinds after, again after,

489
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,270
Q2 was unpredictable of course,

490
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,050
if you had a lot of customers
in the travel industry

491
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,240
or, you know, casino industry, you know,

492
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,880
you might've seen a
higher than expected turn,

493
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,380
but for the most part the companies

494
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,255
that we were working with,

495
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:49,340
they saw a nice boost, you know,

496
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,637
even of of their projections.

497
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,540
After about halfway through the year,

498
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,510
they started upward
revising their numbers,

499
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,908
which was, you know, a pleasant surprise.

500
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:58,800
You know, from our perspective as a firm,

501
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,840
I mean, we made the decision
even before California made

502
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,879
the official lockdown
that we gave everyone

503
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,100
the option to basically work remotely,

504
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,080
basically protect yourselves, your health

505
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,780
and from our perspective, you know,

506
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,570
we really didn't skip a beat.

507
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,817
We had one of the best years,

508
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,410
the last 12 months was a
record 12 months for us.

509
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,210
We had record, you know, revenue growth.

510
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,150
I think I was chatting
with you Rob the other day,

511
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,130
I mean, we saw between
December and January,

512
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,410
you know, and for our team

513
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,200
of our size of about 12, 13 people,

514
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,870
we closed six transactions
in a period of 60 days.

515
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,679
So that was the highest
velocity we have seen

516
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,010
since we've launched the firm.

517
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,160
So very similar to the stories

518
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,200
that Saam and Chenxi
were saying, you know,

519
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,990
uncertainty followed by
just a boom in activity.

520
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,740
- So let's sort of
optimistically say that,

521
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,740
in three months, the entirety
of the globe is vaccinated,

522
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,760
the virus is gone, can
you see yourself changing

523
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,010
the way you work now?

524
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,379
Will you all go back to offices,

525
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,790
will you continue meeting remotely

526
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,860
or will you go back to some

527
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,071
of your old habits of
flying around the world

528
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:07,830
and meeting people and getting
to know people in person?

529
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,611
What's going to stick, and
what's going to change?

530
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,800
Dino, I'll start with
you for that if I may.

531
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,639
- Sure. I think the honest
answer is to be determined.

532
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,412
I personally believe that we'll be living

533
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:23,750
in a hybrid environment
where the learnings

534
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,890
and in my opinion, the productivity

535
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,760
and efficiency gains that you can garner

536
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,920
from adopting a mentality of, you know,

537
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,660
some kind of a hybrid model
while working from home.

538
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,300
I'd say my meetings
increased probably two X

539
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,129
what I was doing in 2019,

540
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,100
mainly because there wasn't too much

541
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,500
of that in between time,
the water cooler talk

542
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,820
which I believe there's
value from that perspective

543
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,800
building rapport, teamwork, culture,

544
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,132
there's certain elements
that you just can't get

545
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,870
over a Zoom meeting,

546
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,479
but from the productivity
side of the house,

547
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,720
I think we've never been
more productive as a firm.

548
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,510
I think if properly balanced,

549
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,540
you can improve people's work life balance

550
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,320
which I know surprising
for an investment advisor,

551
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,860
investment banking firm to say that.

552
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,693
I mean, I truly believe

553
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,210
that this has been a blessing in disguise.

554
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,690
I think in-person meetings

555
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,270
are gonna still be critically important.

556
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,460
And I think the, I
don't know the right way

557
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,730
of phrasing this but the impact of saying,

558
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,530
you know what, I'm going to hop on a plane

559
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,730
and I'm going to fly there
to meet you in person,

560
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,650
to me it has more meaning nowadays.

561
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,280
And even 12 months from
now, I believe people

562
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,920
will naturally feel more
comfortable doing Zoom sessions,

563
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,900
but absolutely, when it comes to,

564
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,870
you know, a big client, a big meeting

565
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,879
or something that's, you
know, super critical,

566
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,240
I'll absolutely be the
first one to get on a plane.

567
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,630
But do I think the days
of flying somewhere

568
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,970
for a one hour board meeting
or a two hour board meeting

569
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,200
and then fly across the
country to come back home,

570
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,530
I'd like to believe some of that

571
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,940
which I'm gonna call inefficiency,

572
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,670
you can probably tell
them which way I'm biased

573
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,800
but I'd like to believe
some of that may be kind of,

574
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,354
you know, dispensed with, so...

575
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:57,270
- Saam, for you?

576
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,190
- Yeah. I'd second, a
lot of what Dino said.

577
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,710
I mean, I think I'd start
with what he started with

578
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,440
which is it is TBD and we'll
see exactly kind of how

579
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,390
the world plays out over
the next few months.

580
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,590
I think some things will snap back, right?

581
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,297
I think the value of
spending time in person,

582
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,430
particularly around really high value,

583
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,760
high importance interactions,

584
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,180
it's very hard to replicate
that over Zoom, right?

585
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,160
And so I think that is gonna snap back.

586
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,459
I also think in dimensions

587
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:26,410
where showing investment is
a form of differentiation,

588
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,410
for example, sales would
be a great example.

589
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,520
Like if I fly to your
office and the other,

590
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,610
you know, vendor or the other partner

591
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,120
or whoever is just
communicating over video,

592
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,209
it could become a relative advantage.

593
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,220
So I think some of those
dynamics are going to play in.

594
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,970
But that said, I think, you know,

595
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,110
I do think a lot of things
are going to stay digital.

596
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,060
So I think of it as like
for the way we do our work,

597
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,370
I think if we're just meeting, you know,

598
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,203
you're an entrepreneur,

599
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:51,036
we're meeting you for the first time,

600
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,200
it's probably more
convenient for you and for us

601
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,684
if we meet over Zoom,

602
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,490
and so I think that's
definitely going to stay.

603
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,400
I think if we're
considering working together

604
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,720
and we're going to invest in your company

605
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,330
and you're going to invite us as partners

606
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,699
and we're going to sign
up for a ten year journey,

607
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,170
I'm highly confident we're
going to end up spending time

608
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,760
in person when possible, right?

609
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,100
And so I think that's
one way to look at it.

610
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,310
The other way to look at it is,

611
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,940
where are relationships where you already

612
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,860
have existing high trust,

613
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,280
and then where do you
need to build high trust?

614
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,410
I think Dino's point around
like water cooler talk,

615
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,730
those things are very
useful for building trust.

616
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,930
And so I look at it like
there's companies I've been

617
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,780
on the board on for many years
now and to be honest like,

618
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,910
we haven't, the CEO and I, we
haven't lost a step digitally

619
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,820
'cause we're such an existing body

620
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,679
of relationship and trust,

621
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,070
that we can have super
direct conversations on Zoom,

622
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,251
and it's no problem, it's no different

623
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:41,210
than if we were in the
same conference room.

624
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,260
I think on the other hand, like, you know,

625
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,500
if I was to invest in
a new company tomorrow,

626
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,740
first time working with the CEO,

627
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,902
it's very likely that I'll want

628
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,980
to spend some meaningful time in person

629
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,300
at least in the beginning,

630
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,980
so we can build that foundation of trust,

631
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,710
shared vulnerability that expands

632
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,130
beyond just work to also personal.

633
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,700
And then I think once that is in place,

634
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,210
again, it's going to
be much more efficient

635
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,210
for a bunch of stuff to default to Zoom.

636
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,070
But I do think in person will play a role

637
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,720
for trust building in particular.

638
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,240
- And beyond Zoom and Slack,

639
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,742
have you seen other applications

640
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:14,430
that have been useful in
maintaining relationships

641
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,492
either in your firm or with an investor,

642
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:20,943
with the firms that you you invest in?

643
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,830
- I'm happy to start.

644
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,899
We use a tool at Greylock called Remotion,

645
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,467
which, you know, Caveat
we're also investors in but,

646
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,030
you know, you could think of it

647
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,710
as a much lighter weight approach

648
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,420
to interact with folks over video.

649
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,270
So instead of like, you know,

650
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,950
Rob needing to send you a Zoom link

651
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,790
and scheduling a time to catch up,

652
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,820
it has a notion of presence and status

653
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,060
so I can see, Hey, you're online.

654
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,139
I can tap on face, you get a quick ping,

655
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,587
Hey, if you're around, do
you want to chat with Saam?

656
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:48,280
It's a great way to
catch up for two minutes,

657
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,292
and like replicate some

658
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,669
of that more serendipitous interactions

659
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,290
so that's one thing we use.

660
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,670
Some of the companies
that we're investors in,

661
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,850
use different tools around
like digital workspaces,

662
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,790
virtual white boarding applications.

663
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,840
Like I have seen a lot
of anecdotal use of that

664
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,459
but we use less of that at Greylock.

665
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,640
- Dino, anything you've
seen that's been useful?

666
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,375
- Yeah, I would say
similar answer to Saam.

667
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,850
I mean, I've certainly come
across some tools when,

668
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,540
on one-off meetings with entrepreneurs,

669
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,553
but as far as what we
use internally as a firm,

670
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,394
I would say we've kind
of stuck to the basics

671
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:25,492
obviously more use of
things like Zoom and Teams

672
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:27,480
and in those types of video chatting.

673
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,834
But we haven't really
found a need to innovate

674
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:34,500
from a, you know, a true kind of tool.

675
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,470
I mean, we're already
very much cloud centric,

676
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,930
cloud first, I mean, you know,

677
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,430
we don't have any local
servers at Momentum.

678
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,390
I mean, it's all strictly a
kind of a cloud first culture,

679
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,130
all of our, you know, endpoints, you know,

680
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,090
our security tools, all have, you know

681
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,280
a cloud management console.

682
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,340
So for us, I mean, it was
really pretty seamless

683
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,243
for us to make the move here.

684
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,043
- So I use a tool called
Two Cam, which is a,

685
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,730
a social video platform,

686
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,029
probably the most accurate description is.

687
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,320
So it facilitates social
interaction amongst folks

688
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,389
that are within that platform.

689
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,197
And it does it in a way very organic,

690
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:16,592
you know, you don't have to like pre say,

691
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,546
put folks in tables or breakout rooms.

692
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:24,060
and you can just go from
one group to another

693
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,669
very much like you're at a cocktail party.

694
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,430
And I use this for my,

695
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,980
I have a social networking group

696
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,140
that I manage and I use this

697
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,960
for my meetups and it's
working out really well.

698
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,350
I think people are just more comfortable

699
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,349
with discussing issues and having

700
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:45,933
these conversations online
and that will continue.

701
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,840
- I'll stick with you if I may, Chenxi.

702
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,770
Have you seen entrepreneurs
respond to this new normal?

703
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,430
Are there cybersecurity startups emerging

704
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,890
who are focused on solving issues

705
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,600
that we didn't have 18 months ago,

706
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,090
that are more focused on
remote working solutions?

707
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,054
Hasn't that started coming out out yet?

708
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:09,650
- I wouldn't say any that
is specifically focused

709
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,380
on remote working because I think

710
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,010
that's a shallow kind of initiative.

711
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,818
What I have seen is it's motivated

712
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:21,990
by the fundamental need
for digital transformation

713
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,750
and fundamental need
to really transitioning

714
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,270
from an archaic infrastructure
to modern infrastructure

715
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,139
and security solutions that cater to that.

716
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,920
Things like, you know,
dynamic network infrastructure

717
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,440
or edge computing,
securing edge computing.

718
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Those are initiatives that I really like,

719
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,750
but it's not necessarily
for remote working per say,

720
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,280
but it is accelerated by remote working.

721
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,713
That I would say is what security
companies are doing today.

722
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,740
- We have about seven, eight minutes left

723
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,347
and still a few questions to get through.

724
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:04,709
I just want to remind the
audience if you have questions,

725
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:07,900
now's the time pop them in
the chat box, hit Submit,

726
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,130
and we'll get to them.

727
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,530
Dino, you mentioned earlier

728
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,023
you completed six deals
in 60 days, is that right?

729
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,903
What were the complications,

730
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:20,600
would you have been able
to do that a year earlier?

731
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,300
Was it actually speeded up by the fact

732
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,557
that you couldn't get
in-person to these companies?

733
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,593
What were the complications?

734
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,050
- Yeah. You know, it's a great question.

735
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,840
So I do believe that the ability

736
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,879
to have kind of back to
back, you know, Zoom sessions

737
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,290
and to frankly, squeeze in more meetings

738
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,370
and just create more time was helpful.

739
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,699
I mean, typically, you know, we would,

740
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,498
you know, if I had to fly
out across the country

741
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:49,980
in order to have a two
day diligence session

742
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,450
and then fly back, that
usually takes me offline

743
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,540
for probably a solid four days, right?

744
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,180
Whereas now, you know, we had, you know,

745
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,090
five-hour diligence
sessions in the morning

746
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,749
and then a three-hour diligence session

747
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:04,010
in that same afternoon.

748
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,800
So I do believe, you know,

749
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,379
had we been in a typical kind of work

750
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,750
from office environment and
a face to face environment,

751
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,060
well, I think two things
would have happened.

752
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,010
One, probably wouldn't have
had six deals compressed

753
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,200
to that short of a timeframe.

754
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,210
'Cause really the reason that happened is,

755
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,170
everyone kind of went to sleep in Q2,

756
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,970
Q3, they came back and said,

757
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,240
we really, you know,
the markets are great,

758
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,450
let's get deals done.

759
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,110
You know, Q4, Q1 of this year is when all

760
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,250
of that activity
culminated in transaction.

761
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,890
So, you know, the time was compressed

762
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,180
but fortunately because
we're working from home,

763
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,480
I think it was a bit
easier to pull that off

764
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,263
than it normally would have been.

765
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,814
- And Saam, I know you closed

766
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:45,669
an investment in a Tel Aviv based company

767
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,223
I think back last October.

768
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,090
Was that sort of business as usual

769
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,980
or very different from
usual, how did that work out?

770
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,320
- Yeah. It's an interesting,
it's an interesting one.

771
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,915
So we led the Series A,
we called in a series

772
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:03,570
in a company called Apeiro
which is based in Tel Aviv.

773
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,669
They're building a code risk
platform to bring context

774
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,350
to developer security and
application security teams.

775
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,320
It's, you know, Chenxi, I
think earlier mentioned,

776
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,789
before the pandemic, you had,

777
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:16,050
you know, closed investments over video

778
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,879
and to actually Apeiro was
a story like that for us

779
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,120
where we actually led the
seed round in the company

780
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,300
in 2019 and the
entrepreneurs have previously

781
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,530
built a business called Erato,

782
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,003
that was an early UEBA
player, Microsoft acquired.

783
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:28,206
So they were well known to us

784
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,120
and well known to people in our network.

785
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,939
We actually closed the
investment entirely over Zoom.

786
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,990
This was summer 2019.

787
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,010
And so in that case we had the benefit

788
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,500
of getting to work with them for a year

789
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,950
and just see the rate of which
they were building product

790
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,310
and customers were adopting.

791
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,560
And so we kind of doubled down

792
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,511
and led a very large Series A
kind of during the pandemic,

793
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:49,180
but it wasn't made more
complex by the pandemic.

794
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,520
- So we've got about five minutes left

795
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,650
and I want to ask each
of you the same question.

796
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,500
So looking forward, I
want to get your say,

797
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,630
your final thoughts on what
you're going to be looking

798
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,693
forth the rest of 2021?

799
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,189
Where are the next cyber
unicorns going to be focused?

800
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,521
What's hot for the next few months?

801
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,379
Chenxi, maybe I can come to you first.

802
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,950
- Sure. So we continue
to see a great momentum

803
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,040
in cloud security.

804
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,690
We have a few investments

805
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,300
in different aspects of cloud security

806
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,427
but I think where the culmination of,

807
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:28,782
you know, modern infrastructure
and policy as code

808
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:32,451
is a trend that I'm watching very closely

809
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:36,360
and looking at how to build
really security pipeline

810
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,990
not just security products,

811
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,090
but security pipeline from design

812
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,090
to remediation and back in
completely automated fashion.

813
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:48,100
I'm looking for companies that will plug

814
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,452
into the pipeline stage

815
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:53,790
and really transform the
business of security.

816
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,822
- And is that all across the
world, anywhere in particular,

817
00:33:56,822 --> 00:34:00,289
any markets that you think
are about to explode?

818
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,480
- US is definitely the, in terms
of adoption, is the market.

819
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,214
And if you're looking at
innovation, it's Israel and US.

820
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,380
And one thing that this
year has taught us,

821
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,659
is we can do business
unincumbered by physical facility.

822
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,509
So I'm looking forward to continuing

823
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,133
this motto going forward.

824
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,331
- Dino, what about you?

825
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,859
What are you getting excited
about for the rest of the year?

826
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,469
Where are you looking for new investments?

827
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,929
- Yeah, I mean, I would say full,

828
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,580
fully agree with Chenxi
and the area she mentioned.

829
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,440
I would say an extension kind of cloud.

830
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,038
I would say the cloud kind of activities,

831
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:39,467
zero trust network access.

832
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:42,149
I think there's room for talking

833
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,060
about more unicorns in that space.

834
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,389
So we expect to see
more and more companies

835
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,409
that continue to pile on the market.

836
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,339
Right now, it's kind of a Z-scaler

837
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,300
from a public company perspective

838
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,329
that's really winning that market.

839
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,248
I know Palo Alto has a solution just based

840
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:58,140
on a couple of acquisitions they made

841
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,129
but we expect to see more activity.

842
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,880
The iBosses, Perimeter 81s
and others of the world.

843
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,050
So, you know, from a unicorn watch

844
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,910
I would say that's one area
we're keeping our eyes on.

845
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,980
You know, another one
which is not kind of the,

846
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,360
the most glamorous I would say,

847
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,740
when you think about cyber security

848
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,100
from a technical perspective,

849
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,025
but security services still
the top area of investment,

850
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:23,740
maybe not so much for the
earlier stage investors

851
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,339
that are looking for the
most innovative capabilities

852
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,500
and technologies but it's an area where,

853
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,380
you know, security tools and
in kind of consolidated on

854
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,410
your security architectures
and your security stock

855
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,600
of the organization is
increasing and is in importance.

856
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,819
Shortage of security talent
is not getting any better.

857
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,410
You know, there's the data exhaust problem

858
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,569
that we're trying to make
more sense out of more data

859
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,260
so a lot of people are turning more

860
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,490
and more to professional services firm,

861
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,299
managed services firms,
you know, red teaming,

862
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,500
blue teaming, purple
teaming, pen testing firms.

863
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,580
So we actually expect to see funding

864
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,460
to continue to flow into
the security services space

865
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,020
especially on the private equity front.

866
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,097
I'd say it's one of the top areas

867
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:06,071
that we're always pinged on is,

868
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:07,799
the private equity folks seem to love

869
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,689
the security services market

870
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:13,089
and we think it's a huge
opportunity there as well.

871
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,610
- And Saam, last word to you, what's your,

872
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,330
what's your hot tips?

873
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,210
- I mean, those were a
lot of good areas covered

874
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,440
by both Dino and Chenxi.

875
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,000
And I'd second what Chenxi said,

876
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
just run like the opportunity said.

877
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,060
It's interesting Jerome Powell,

878
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,406
like the chair of the Fed was
on "60 Minutes" yesterday,

879
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,450
and he called out cybersecurity risk

880
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,980
as the biggest risk to
the economy going forward.

881
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,580
And that's the opportunity

882
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,110
for kind of the newest
generation of entrepreneurs.

883
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,810
I'd call out a couple
areas that we're excited

884
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,890
about at Greylock.

885
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,480
One is, you know, to Chenxi's point,

886
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,995
just cloud security and thinking

887
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:44,750
about kind of hybrid multi-cloud security

888
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,740
and what that means.

889
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,500
And I like, I really like what she said

890
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,130
around the entire pipeline.

891
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,080
So from design to, you know, applications,

892
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,980
infrastructure, running and production.

893
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,400
So I think that's one area.

894
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,200
The second area is around data security.

895
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,399
And I again break that both
into kind of identification

896
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,440
and classification of sensitive data

897
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,000
in the kind of heterogeneous
IT environments,

898
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,360
and also the access
governance piece, right?

899
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,860
And monitoring access,
so that's the second.

900
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,660
The third is around shift left.

901
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,560
So as companies all
become software companies

902
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,120
and developer productivity
becomes more boring,

903
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,392
security responsibilities is shift earlier

904
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,569
and more towards the design phase.

905
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,970
And so there's opportunity in tooling

906
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,589
that's going to support that.

907
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,390
And then the last piece
is around identity.

908
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,690
And when I say identity,

909
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,580
I mean that both in
terms of like, you know,

910
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,319
core authentication
authorization on SAS, IAS pass,

911
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,211
but also around monitoring
and anomaly identification

912
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,120
around different identity patterns.

913
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,240
I think that's gonna be
really important as well.

914
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,290
- Fantastic. Well, I'm
afraid all too quickly

915
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,890
the time has flown by and
we've reached the end.

916
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,379
So I said, we're going to stay

917
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,000
for a few minutes longer
to answer questions.

918
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,225
The screen showing should have each

919
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,920
of our email addresses as well

920
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,170
if you want to get in touch directly.

921
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,850
And my thanks to the
panelists, Dr. Chenxi Wang,

922
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,680
Saam Motamedi and Dino Boukouris

923
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,210
for the time and for
sharing their perspectives.

924
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,310
Thanks to you in the audience
for listening, participating

925
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,270
and a huge thanks to
everyone behind the scenes

926
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,060
including our producer,
Jenna and her team,

927
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,220
Amy Jordan and her colleagues
for wrangling all the speakers

928
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,209
and everyone at RSA for
putting this fantastic event

929
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,220
and many others each year together.

930
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,870
Enjoy the rest of your day.

931
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,029
Thanks for tuning in.

932
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,982
All the best. Goodbye.

933
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

934
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,217
- Thanks.
- Good bye.
