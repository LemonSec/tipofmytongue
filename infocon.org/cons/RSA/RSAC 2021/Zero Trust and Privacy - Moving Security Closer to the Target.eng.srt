00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,697
- Hi, I'm Wes Gyure.

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:04,730
I'm the director of offering management

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,690
and strategy in the
security division of IBM.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,840
Thanks for joining me today.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,841
I'm gonna walk you through
zero trust and privacy,

6
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:13,280
moving security closer to your target.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,840
We all know that delivering a
trusted and secure experience

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,387
is now a customer expectation.

9
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,804
Clients doing business with us digitally

10
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:24,973
expect that we're going to be securing

11
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:27,241
and keeping their data private.

12
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,980
In a recent study, one in
five consumers avoided buying

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,370
a brand over its data practices
in the past 12 months.

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,943
I know for myself, this has happened.

15
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:40,094
There has been big box hardware stores

16
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,940
that have had data breaches

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,275
at their point of sales machines.

18
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:46,910
And I've chosen not to shop there anymore

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,809
because in the back of my mind,

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,060
every time I go into that store,

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,750
every time I put my card into that machine

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,780
I think about is my data
gonna be compromised?

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,530
If somebody's gonna take that data?

24
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,220
Will I have to close that credit card

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,300
and reopen a new one and
go through all the hassle

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,949
of calling my bank?

27
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,049
That goes through my mind.

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,010
It probably does in your mind as well.

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,529
I know lots of people who go through

30
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:10,440
and they choose to get
off of digital media

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,429
or social media because
they have in it, you know

32
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,720
this expectation of what may be happening

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
to their personal data behind the scenes.

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,940
So we know this happens
and we know it's important

35
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,080
but it's really important
for us as we think

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,870
about changing the way we
do business with our clients

37
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,150
because if they can't trust our service,

38
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,490
if we can't differentiate
ourselves on privacy

39
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,056
and the way that we treat
their personal data,

40
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,101
they'll choose to shop elsewhere.

41
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,686
19% of consumers have chosen

42
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:40,086
or switched to select to a competitor

43
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,760
that they feel have better
data security policies

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,350
that have better data privacy policies.

45
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,183
And that's important

46
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:48,369
because it gives us that chance
to differentiate ourselves

47
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:53,094
with security and with a
model that makes and insure us

48
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:55,994
that we're doing the right
thing with our customer's data.

49
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,020
But this is juxtaposed

50
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,410
with what's happening in
our environment right now.

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,750
We know, in light of the pandemic,

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,196
in light of other
circumstances, just in general,

53
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,668
we are on this rapid transformation.

54
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:12,240
We are looking at
digitalizing our businesses.

55
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,350
We are doing things completely different

56
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,010
than we have ever done in the past.

57
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,970
No longer do you walk into
a store and buy insurance,

58
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,420
or sit down with an
agent to buy insurance,

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,369
no longer do you even need to go

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,010
into a grocery store
to get your groceries.

61
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,859
You can do all of that
online through Apple apps

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,836
and then you can do curbside pickup.

63
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,210
There's no need to interact
with humans anymore.

64
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,890
It's all about interacting seamlessly

65
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,477
through an application
experience, a cloud experience.

66
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:41,100
And that changes the way we need to think

67
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,980
about how we interact with our customers.

68
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,760
It changes the expectations
that our customers have

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,790
but it also means

70
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,204
that expectations are rapidly
changing for our consumers.

71
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,480
And that means for our
companies that we have

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
to give autonomy to our
application development,

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,799
to our line of business.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,680
So they can go out

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,970
and quickly spin up these new applications

76
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,100
in these hybrid multi-cloud
environments to reach customers

77
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,239
in a new way or to reach
employees in a new way,

78
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,830
remote workforce or
business partners who want

79
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,210
to interact digitally as well.

80
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,500
This means new applications,
data shifting off

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,235
of your premises into cloud repositories.

82
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:21,330
And it brings with it a lot of complexity

83
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,600
and security challenges that we all know

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,200
and frankly worry us at night.

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,459
Is my data safe?

86
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,500
Am I securing that data?

87
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Am I ensuring that that data
privacy for my end clients?

88
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:39,210
These are things that are
just making our lives harder.

89
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,890
They're making us degrade that security

90
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,010
and trust that we just talked about.

91
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,500
That's so paramount to
the customer experience

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,838
that our clients are now expecting.

93
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,190
And so we're looking

94
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,190
to new security frameworks to
help us manage this problem.

95
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,170
How do we start to bring
together all of these tools

96
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,149
that we have, both third party, you know

97
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,600
all these third-party tools.

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,010
We might have niche tools that are doing

99
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,609
very specific things and
here at RSA this week

100
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,870
I'm sure you're gonna learn about lots

101
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,190
of cool new tools that you wanna deploy

102
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,992
but if they don't work together,

103
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:16,339
if they're not sharing
context with one another,

104
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,130
then they're just yet
more complexity that you

105
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,019
have to manage in this Cloud environment.

106
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,289
So zero trust gives us this framework.

107
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,587
It's a perfect framework
because what it does is it says

108
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:29,680
that these security siloed
tools need to work together.

109
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,670
They need to share context so

110
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,370
that you can create
better application rules

111
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,750
or better security and privacy rules,

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,730
to create better actions
to find and hunt for risk

113
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,680
and threats in your environment.

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,443
And then remediate those problems.

115
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,850
Zero trust is about protecting your data

116
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,990
and the identities and the access patterns

117
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,410
that they have around that data

118
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,310
and using all of these tools in concert.

119
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,330
So let's dig into that,
that concept of context

120
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,710
and shared context across
security silo tools.

121
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,590
What do I mean by that?

122
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,423
Let me break it down

123
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:05,500
and give you a couple
of different use cases

124
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,740
'cause I think this will help
sort of show you what I mean

125
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,490
by creating better security policy.

126
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,000
So if we take maybe the
notion of insider threat,

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,793
it's an easy one for us to think about,

128
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,130
almost every tool that
we have has some sort

129
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,650
of element of insider threat,
whether that's an identity

130
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,120
and access management
tool or data security tool

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,699
or an endpoint management tool,

132
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,940
each and every one of
those things is looking

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,610
at user behavior.

134
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,200
It's looking at different
elements of user behavior,

135
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,599
but it's getting a glimpse
into are their potential risks

136
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,323
with this particular user.

137
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,750
Individually, each of those pieces

138
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,700
of telemetry are important.

139
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,214
But when you start to combine
that story, when you see that

140
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,150
(throat clearing) somebody
that a user is accessing

141
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,590
your network from a new endpoint

142
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,869
that you've never seen before

143
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,220
and recently they've had a
bunch of failed login attempts

144
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,580
from their identity and access
management system, or you see

145
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,539
from your governance, you're
getting a governance system

146
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,760
that they've recently
changed their privileges

147
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,400
or given themselves more privileges.

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,429
You combine that together
with anomalous data usage

149
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,550
or data activity that you're
seeing with data security.

150
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,360
When you put those pieces
of the puzzle together,

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,420
then it's very clear that you
have an insider threat problem

152
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,720
that maybe it's an nefarious user

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,460
or maybe it's compromised credentials

154
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,310
or maybe it's, you know, somebody
doing something different

155
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,920
or something they shouldn't be doing.

156
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,690
Bringing those pieces together, allow you

157
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,910
to really proactively hunt
risks within your environment.

158
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,427
This is about sharing context
across security siloed tools.

159
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,640
(throat clearing)

160
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,110
Let me give you another one.

161
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,770
This one's more about how do
you optimize certain patterns?

162
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,603
We're spending a lot

163
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,890
of time talking about consumer experience.

164
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,360
We're spending time
talking about data privacy,

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,940
security trust, and
transparency that your consumers

166
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,183
are expecting when they do
business with you as a business.

167
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,590
And in that, they want a
frictionless experience.

168
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,049
They wanna be secure

169
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,330
but they want a frictionless experience.

170
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,159
They don't wanna have to
jump through hoops every time

171
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,460
they navigate to a new
piece of your application

172
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,090
or a new page in your application,

173
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,018
they don't wanna have to put
in new credentials every time

174
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,630
that they log into a different page.

175
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,603
They want it to be seamless,
frictionless, but secure.

176
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,280
So if you wanted to make
your rules for data security

177
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,109
more efficient, if you
want to make your identity

178
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,470
and access patterns and access
management more efficient,

179
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,750
you need to share data across those tools.

180
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,230
So in this use case,
what I'd like to think

181
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,730
about is based on the repository
of where you have data,

182
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,280
if that data is sensitive information

183
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,969
or personal information,

184
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:55,969
and then you see an access
pattern of somebody coming

185
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:01,265
into use that information,
you can now start to say, okay

186
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:04,410
this is a repository with
sensitive information.

187
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,030
I'm gonna look at my
access governance rules.

188
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm gonna validate that
the person has access to

189
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,280
that repository, especially in the light

190
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,059
of it being sensitive
of personal information.

191
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm going to validate that
what they're doing is normal

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,040
that this is an access pattern
that I would typically see.

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,060
It's 8:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday,

194
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,220
whatever the time may be,
or if it's out of bounds.

195
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,750
Is this the first time
that they've ever logged

196
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,330
into this repository?

197
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,630
Is this the first time

198
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,101
or the only time they've
ever logged in after hours?

199
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:38,460
If it is, and it's a sensitive
repository maybe then I need

200
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,559
to force a multi-factor authentication.

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,869
I need to put, you know, send
a text alert to their phone.

202
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,470
I need to have them scan a QR code.

203
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,890
I need to validate that it's really them.

204
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the notion of zero trust.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,670
This is the notion of sharing context

206
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,449
to make better informed decisions

207
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,800
and make more efficient decisions.

208
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,877
If it's not a sensitive repository.

209
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,530
And it's just a data repository

210
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,670
or a piece of your application

211
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,885
that has no sensitive information in it.

212
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,400
Why go through the friction

213
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,040
of forcing a multifactor authentication?

214
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,740
So you get both sides of the world.

215
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,900
You get the both sides of this coin right?

216
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,890
The ability to enforce security

217
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,580
at the same time that you get the ability

218
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,160
to provide a frictionless experience.

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,760
And you can't do that unless
you're sharing context.

220
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,260
Context also means that
you need a platform

221
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,110
to share context.

222
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,780
You need some way to share context

223
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,670
and data across these siloed
tools in an efficient way

224
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,760
but isn't a point to
point product integration

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,939
because we all know that
while we have great ecosystems

226
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,560
of products, they don't
all work with each other.

227
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,774
And you may have chosen a tool
different from somebody else

228
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,780
and you want those tools to work together.

229
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,649
So you need a platform to share that data.

230
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,990
One that is open, an open
ecosystem that gives you

231
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,670
the ability to share data
across any niche tools,

232
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,500
any third-party tools, bring it together

233
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,050
and to draw these insights
and then to take action.

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,833
But it's not just about security.

235
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,310
And many of our clients who
are looking at this know that,

236
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,359
they know that to do
zero trust really well,

237
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,130
you have to take a
business first approach.

238
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,900
You have to think about the goals

239
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,250
that you're trying to achieve.

240
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,170
You have to think about, am
I helping my end clients?

241
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,790
Am I achieving the digital transformation

242
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,370
that my company needs to go through?

243
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,840
Am I providing that experience

244
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,667
that my customers are expecting?

245
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:35,449
A business first approach is
about those specific things.

246
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,750
It's about accomplishing your goals,

247
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,846
making sure that the assets
that you want to give access to

248
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,680
whether those are
applications or resources

249
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,040
or data or APIs, even right,

250
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,510
that they're available,
that they're reliable,

251
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,530
that they're secure, that
they're giving that experience

252
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,760
that customers tend to expect,

253
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
they have and give trust and transparency,

254
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,730
that encourage us to go shop
or to use that application

255
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,000
as opposed to looking at that
box store that I looked at

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,900
and saying, Hey maybe this
isn't the place for me to shop.

257
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:13,780
We all know that business first

258
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,250
and a lot of what you're
going through right now

259
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,380
is shifting to hybrid multi-cloud.

260
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,330
And that is both important
from the way that you interact

261
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,270
with your consumers and your customers.

262
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,110
It's also important

263
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,340
about how you interact
with your own employees.

264
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,550
We know people are everywhere today.

265
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,219
They're signing in from new devices,

266
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,074
they're signing in from
new locations and networks.

267
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,613
They're doing businesses in places that

268
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:38,930
they've never done business before

269
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,239
and we have to enable them

270
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
and we have to provide
that experience for them.

271
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,620
These are the things that accompanies

272
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,360
that we're working with, with
zero trust, with making sure

273
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,410
that they have the next
gen security framework.

274
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,199
These are the challenges
that they're experiencing

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
and that we're helping them.

276
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,930
So a little bit more about sort

277
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,329
of a framework for how you define context

278
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,980
and what does it mean and
what do you do with it?

279
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,880
Obviously, the first step is
about the finding context,

280
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,770
just understanding your users,
your data, your applications,

281
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,254
the resources they wanna connect to.

282
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,220
What sorts of data do you
have in those repositories?

283
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,053
Is it sensitive?

284
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,299
Is it personal information?

285
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:17,310
Is it data that, you
know you need to protect

286
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,969
and add extra security controls around?

287
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,578
Defining that context basically
gives you a boundaries

288
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:26,026
for where and how to prioritize
the risks and the threats

289
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,020
and the proactive analytics
that you wanna put

290
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,262
into your environment
so that you can ensure

291
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:32,790
that you are providing
a secure, transparent

292
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,913
and safe experience.

293
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,247
The next step is around
verifying and enforcing.

294
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,880
Verifying enforce.

295
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,140
So that's really the step where you start

296
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,660
to put those security controls in place.

297
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,270
Now that you've understand your resources

298
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,970
and your applications and
the data that you have

299
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,020
in your hybrid multi-cloud environment,

300
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,960
you wanna put the right
controls around them.

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,170
You wanna start collecting
the right telemetry.

302
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,329
You wanna look at things
like activity monitoring,

303
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,780
how that data is being accessed.

304
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,770
You wanna make sure that you have

305
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,252
the right identity access
governance rules in place.

306
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,930
How do I define that the right
user has the right access

307
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,026
to the right data at the right times.

308
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,470
You wanna look at your network controls.

309
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,490
You wanna look at your segmentation.

310
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,070
All of these pieces of verifying force,

311
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,720
fall into verify and enforce

312
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,223
so that you can put those
security controls in place.

313
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,699
And then we move on to
resolving incidents.

314
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,450
And inevitably we're going to
have incidents that we have

315
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,000
to resolve whether they're
misconfigurations, accidents,

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,587
nefarious users, whatever it may be.

317
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,950
We've got lots of different tools

318
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,070
that are connected sharing context.

319
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,830
We have security policies that
are optimized and efficient.

320
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,850
We have to layer in analytics

321
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,040
because there's a lot of telemetry there.

322
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,439
There's a lot of different
tools that we're using

323
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,910
in this hybrid multi-cloud environment.

324
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,100
And we have to think about

325
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
how do we find that
needle in the haystack?

326
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,350
How do we go find those risks
and those threats proactively?

327
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,000
How are we using machine learning

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,370
and analytics to go hunt those threats?

329
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,520
And then when we do to resolve them.

330
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,845
Do we have orchestrated
and automated playbooks

331
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,750
that are behind those incident detection?

332
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,680
Or if you have a SOC
analyst who determines

333
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,189
that there's a potential problem?

334
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,380
Do they have a way to
quickly resolve those issues

335
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,980
with the click of a button?

336
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,721
To kick off playbooks, to open tickets,

337
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:21,260
to make configuration changes,
to enforce policy changes,

338
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,427
whatever it may be.

339
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:25,600
You need a way to resolve those incidents.

340
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
And then as part of your
closed loop feedback process,

341
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,770
you need to analyze and
improve your process.

342
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,480
Where can I make a better security rule?

343
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,790
Where can I contain or combine context

344
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,846
from one of my other security tools

345
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:42,719
and make my security posture
and my risk posture better.

346
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,950
Zero trust is a framework.

347
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,570
Zero trust is a journey.

348
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,020
It's not a product that you implement.

349
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,131
It's not a product that
you turn on overnight.

350
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,750
It's about continuous improvement.

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,370
It's about making sure

352
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,980
that you're building
the best security rule.

353
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,810
Start simple, start small,
look at data and access,

354
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,380
data is at the core of
a zero trust strategy.

355
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,960
Start to build from there,
your identity, your network,

356
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,610
your end point, your user perspectives.

357
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,507
Bring that context together,

358
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,079
wrapper that with your
analytics and machine learning

359
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,467
and your ability to then
drive orchestrated response

360
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,480
and iterate on that as
a part of this process

361
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,853
for how do you build a
successful zero trust model?

362
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:28,270
Once you've done that, once you
have a model for zero trust,

363
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,667
that's when you're able to
actually show your end customers

364
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,130
that you are enforcing privacy.

365
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,360
We know all privacy is exp.

366
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,190
We know privacy is important to all of us.

367
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,750
Regulations are changing every day.

368
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,470
They're enforcing more privacy
rules and controls on us.

369
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,210
We have to be ready for audits.

370
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,580
We have to know if data gets breached

371
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,103
what do we do on the outset
of those data breaches.

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,280
And as we put these controls in place,

373
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,890
as we lower our risk posture,

374
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,650
as we build a successful
zero trust policy,

375
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,030
you're going to be building
a data privacy solution

376
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,650
that you can ensure your customers

377
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,939
that you have trust and transparency.

378
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,000
You can ensure your users
that you're the client

379
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,743
or the sorry, you're the business
that clients should trust.

380
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,950
It's gonna let you differentiate.

381
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,470
It's gonna let you grow your business.

382
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,930
That's why these things
are so intrinsically linked

383
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,245
to privacy and security

384
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,160
in this hybrid multi-cloud environment

385
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
and how zero trust really starts
to help us deliver on that.

386
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,895
So I'm gonna leave you with
sort of a customer example

387
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:35,120
and this is a great one
because you're gonna see them

388
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,650
at the IBM keynote this
week at the RSA conference.

389
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,680
So Mary O'Brien, the General
Manager of IBM Security will be

390
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,450
on stage with the CISO of Dow chemical.

391
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,690
And they're gonna be talking

392
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,400
about their journey through zero trust.

393
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
And it's an important journey.

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,060
And I think it's one that sort

395
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,359
of espouses what I've
just been talking about.

396
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,550
This CISO is responsible

397
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,290
for three majors things at his company.

398
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,369
He's responsible for security.

399
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,454
He's responsible for
compliance data privacy

400
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,319
but most importantly, he's responsible

401
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
for the rapid digital transformation

402
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,233
and achieving business goals.

403
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,230
So what he does from his
security and compliance role,

404
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,540
the policies he puts in place all have

405
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,190
to support that ability
to transform his business,

406
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,670
to help achieve those business goals,

407
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,540
to reach their business
partners and their customers

408
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,683
in a different and a new and engaging way.

409
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,780
One of the things that
they're working through

410
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,057
and you'll hear about this in the keynote

411
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,030
and I encourage you to go listen to that,

412
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,528
is is that what they really
wanted to do was provide

413
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:48,380
their customers, provide
the business partners,

414
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,700
provide their employees a
new way to secure the access

415
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,430
to data and resources that matter

416
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,010
that we're able to give them the ability

417
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,063
to do their business, to do their job.

418
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,790
And so they changed the way

419
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,810
that they looked at their networks.

420
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,990
They started to look at their
networks as the internet.

421
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,750
The internet is their network.

422
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,765
People can come from any direction.

423
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,258
People can come from any location,

424
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,810
in or out of their networks,
into their SAS applications.

425
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,190
How do they start to build
the right security controls

426
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,190
and postures around that notion
of transforming perimeter

427
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,459
of one that no longer exists just

428
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,080
within their networks themselves.

429
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,949
And so these are the challenges
that they'll talk about,

430
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,970
but this is how they took
this contextual based model.

431
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,960
They applied a set of networking tools.

432
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,960
They surprised if they used a
framework from IBM zero trust,

433
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,290
and they built on that
platform of shared context,

434
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,810
better security rules and
better security policies

435
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,234
to lower their risk posture,

436
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:53,810
to improve and deliver
on those businesses.

437
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,370
And more importantly to provide
that frictionless experience

438
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,760
that their end customers,
clients and employees

439
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,320
and business partners
all expected to have.

440
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,840
So it's a great story.

441
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,370
You'll learn more about it at the keynote.

442
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,379
I encourage you to listen to it.

443
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,300
And with that, I'll take any questions.

444
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,113
If you had questions
along through the process,

445
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,010
I'll be happy to answer those
right in the chat window.

446
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,500
Please take your time.

447
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,090
And with that, thank you for your time.

448
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,970
Thank you for your attention.

449
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,403
And I hope you enjoy the
rest of the conference.
