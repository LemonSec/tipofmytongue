1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,893
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,893 --> 00:00:03,653
And welcome to a little adventure.

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:08,320
I'd like to introduce Erin
Englund from BioCatch,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,288
she's gonna be our Dr. Watson for today.

5
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:13,970
- And I'd like to introduce
Uri Rivner, also from BioCatch,

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,149
who will be Sherlock Holmes today.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,113
And we will be fighting
Deep Social Engineering,

8
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:22,930
a very mysterious new crime happening

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,660
in the streets of London,
and elsewhere these days

10
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,210
- [Narrator] "I had
called up on my friend,

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,314
Mr. Sherlock Holmes one day
in the autumn of last year

12
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,205
and found him in deep conversation

13
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,760
with a very stout,
florid-faced elderly gentleman

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,571
with fiery red hair.

15
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,470
With an apology for my intrusion,
I was about to withdraw

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,540
when Holmes pulled me
abruptly into the room

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,990
and close the door behind me.

18
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,060
'You could not possibly
have come at a better time,

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,120
my dear Watson,' he said cordially."

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,227
- So let's meet the characters
of this story called,

21
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:57,000
"The Red-Headed League."

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,030
We start with Jabez Wilson.

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,400
He owns a pawnbroker shop.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,510
It's essentially an establishment

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,090
in London for secured loans.

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,310
It's a physical shop located
in the financial district,

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,200
and now let's meet the
assistant, Mr. Vincent Spaulding.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,928
He actually got the shop assistant
position a few months ago

29
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:22,419
and urged Jabez to apply for the job

30
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:24,820
at the Red-Headed League.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,880
Let's focus on that specific piece.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,880
So Jabez, he's a London
gentlemen with fiery red hair,

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,866
like very, very red hair.

34
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:37,610
He applies for an ad in the newspaper,

35
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,645
offering highly paid work

36
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:44,645
that only red-headed
gentlemen can apply for.

37
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:48,788
- [Narrator] "To the Red-Headed League,

38
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:51,960
on account of the bequest
of the late Ezekiah Hopkins

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,640
of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, USA,

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,460
there is now another vacancy
open, which entitles a member

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,100
of the league to a salary
of four pounds a week

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,390
for purely nominal services.

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,187
All red-headed men who
are sound in body and mind

44
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:08,449
and above the age of
21 years are eligible.

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,049
Apply in person on Monday
at 11 o'clock to Duncan Ross

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,680
at the offices of The League,
7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,990
- That was the actual ad on
the newspaper and Duncan Ross,

48
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,500
he's the person that
accepted Jabez to The League,

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,389
to the Red-Headed League.

50
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:29,281
He's the manager of the Red-Headed
League office in London.

51
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,912
He offers Jabez this dream job.

52
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:35,550
There are two minor conditions,

53
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,270
copying the Encyclopedia Britannica

54
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,970
as Jabez is in their office all day long.

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,444
And then Jabez must not leave the office

56
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:50,350
for any reason whenever he's at that post.

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,112
So essentially Jabez in order to apply

58
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,720
and meet the requirements

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,250
for that job is gonna
be away from his shop.

60
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,840
Then at some point, a few weeks later,

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,961
Duncan Ross mysteriously disappears.

62
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,810
And this is when Jabez contacted us.

63
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,430
How do we actually crack this case?

64
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,920
Let's actually talk about the real crime.

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,130
Spaulding was none other than
the mastermind, John Clay,

66
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,840
one of the smartest people in London.

67
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,360
Selected the shop as
ideally located to tunnel

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,380
into a certain bank, a physical tunnel,

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,299
and established long-term
credibility with Wilson.

70
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,850
Then published the ad in the newspaper

71
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,549
and pushed Wilson to accept the job.

72
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,590
In fact, hundreds of
people went to that street

73
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,076
and the address to be interviewed.

74
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:46,076
But of course his assistant
or accomplish, his sidekick,

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,951
his name is Archie,
not really Duncan Ross.

76
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,650
He basically set up the whole thing.

77
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,900
The red-headed lead job was to keep Wilson

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,577
out of his shop while they dig.

79
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:03,840
And the plan was foiled by us.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
We figured it all out.

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,666
We set a trap at the vault
using the Scotland Yard too

82
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:12,666
and actually apprehend the two criminals.

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,421
So, the crime was foiled, but
how do we actually understand

84
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:19,320
that it is a crime?

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,638
Because all of these were
very mysterious circumstances.

86
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,760
The job itself, it was
too good to be true,

87
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:29,710
creating this sense of
urgency, unique opportunity,

88
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,190
telling the lucky winner he's
the best of class, right?

89
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,219
So you have hundreds of people
with red head, red hair,

90
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,120
and only Jabez is the one
that is gonna be selected.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,453
He's like best out of everyone.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,339
The job makes no sense at all, right?

93
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:49,750
And then suspicious
behavior around the shop.

94
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,170
So if we look at the shop itself,

95
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,120
the assistant is willing to get half wages

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
just to learn the business.

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,490
Frequents the shop's cellar
so he can develop photos.

98
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,390
The last thing is some high-risk
events in the vicinity.

99
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,010
There was a specific bank
in the financial district

100
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,550
not too far from the shop

101
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,991
that was expecting a huge
shipment of French gold.

102
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:16,991
Take all of these features,
put it into the brilliant mind

103
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,740
of the best detective in London,
and there you have it, so.

104
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:29,040
- [Narrator] "Well, I thought
over the mater all day,

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,313
and by evening I was in low spirits again,

106
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:35,640
but I had quite persuaded myself

107
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,282
that the whole affair must
be some great hoax or fraud,

108
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,440
though what is object might be

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,490
I could not imagine.

110
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,920
It seemed altogether past belief

111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,626
that anyone could make such a will,

112
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:48,320
or that they would pay such
a sum for doing anything

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,540
so simple as copying out the
Encyclopedia Britannica."

114
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,877
- That was actually
Jabez thinking it over,

115
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,440
"Is it too good to be true?"

116
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
And in many cases the victims
of social engineering,

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,469
sometimes they do sense
that something is off,

118
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,810
but they still go with it
because the whole story is

119
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,295
so convincing and so much
is invested in that story

120
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:09,270
that they basically at some point

121
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,733
just believe in it and go with it.

122
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:15,620
So, Dr. Watson, maybe this
is a good time for you

123
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,430
to tell us a little bit
about social engineering?

124
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,779
- Yes, first let's define
social engineering.

125
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,610
It's a psychological manipulation

126
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,241
of people into performing actions

127
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:28,280
or divulging confidential information.

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,280
The con is the purpose
of information gathering,

129
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,561
fraud, or system access.

130
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:36,790
It differs from a traditional
con as it's one of many steps

131
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,453
in a more complex scheme.

132
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,180
A broader definition is, "Any
act that influences a person

133
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,277
to take an action that is
not in their best interest."

134
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,530
Online social engineering
comes in many different forms.

135
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,299
First we have credentials harvesting.

136
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,870
So this comes in the form
of phishing, vishing,

137
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,830
or smishing, tricking victims

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,500
into willingly giving up credentials

139
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,390
or sensitive information.

140
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,570
Remote access tool traps, which
is a near-real-time drama.

141
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,960
So this comes in the
form of helpdesk scams

142
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,820
where the victim is coerced to
install a remote access tool

143
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,070
and hands over access

144
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,728
to their online banking session
directly to the fraudster.

145
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,728
OTP or a one-time use passcode
collection, user distraction.

146
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,650
This is a real-time drama.

147
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,479
So this comes in the form of phone scams

148
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,159
where the OTP is collected
for immediate use,

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,890
for example enrolling and paying

150
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,739
in a real-time payment
method such as Zelle.

151
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,421
Or we see malware, like Trojan manning

152
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,870
the browser functionality designed

153
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,570
to distract the user and collect the OTPs.

154
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,290
Finally, we have our most
nefarious social engineering yet,

155
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,540
which is deep social engineering.

156
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,310
We see voice scams where
the genuine user is tricked

157
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,283
into transferring money
directly to the fraudster.

158
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,310
- So let's actually start with
this story of the helpdesk.

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,308
Someone actually got a
phone call from the bank

160
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:13,308
after the bank's fraud team
saw something suspicious

161
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:16,160
in real time and called the user.

162
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,970
That was actually the session flow.

163
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,340
You see the user logging in

164
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,469
and you see all of these
payment activities.

165
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,410
What I can tell you
about this specific case,

166
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,400
we talk about online banking here.

167
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,229
The user passed the two-factor
authentication code.

168
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,738
This is in the UK and in wealth management

169
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,164
that's the norm when you log in.

170
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:37,630
It's coming from the
user's trusted device,

171
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,679
regular location, normal activity time.

172
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,789
Transaction amount is pretty typical

173
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,890
for this specific person.

174
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,574
The session is a little
bit longer than usual

175
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:50,430
and there were six payments
made to a new beneficiary.

176
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,418
So there are some more
suspicious facts here

177
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:57,450
but of course in itself it's not enough

178
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,500
to basically say something is off here.

179
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,291
Now the actual story is that the user,

180
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,277
when the fraud team
called that person said,

181
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,550
"Hey, you know, I know I have a problem

182
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,670
in my online banking and
you called me an hour ago

183
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,670
and you said that there is this problem,

184
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,689
you're the helpdesk and
you can help me fix it

185
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,010
if I only give you some
remote support functionality

186
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,319
and I said, 'Hey, I'm 80 years old.

187
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,340
I don't understand much about computers.'

188
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,164
You said, 'It's gonna be fine, sir.

189
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,722
Do you know Google?'

190
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,540
And I said, "Yeah, sure, I know Google."

191
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,540
And you asked me to go to
Google and search for TeamViewer

192
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,540
which is the software that
gives remote assistance.

193
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,360
And I found it and I installed
it and I couldn't figure it.

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,100
And I gave you guys remote
support or whatever.

195
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,840
It was very difficult for me.

196
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,740
And then you asked me
to log into my accounts

197
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,440
so you can run some tests,

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,900
and you said that you're gonna call back,

199
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,150
but now you guys are
calling, you do not know

200
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,530
about the first people that called me.

201
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,430
So I'm very, very confused,

202
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,162
I don't really know what's going on?"

203
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,340
Now, as you understand,

204
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,010
obviously that was social engineering,

205
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,410
tricking the user to install TeamViewer,

206
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,837
which is just a commercially
available remote access tool.

207
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,580
This is the user logging in.

208
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,500
So at the login itself,
everything looks fine.

209
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,983
You see the user are moving the mouse.

210
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,988
It's gonna be a smooth
hand eye coordination

211
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,453
to regular behavior for this person.

212
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,670
The keypad was used to entering OTP.

213
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,969
That's what the bank
always sees for this user.

214
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,140
The behavior basically
matches the baseline

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,380
for this account.

216
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,070
But two minutes later, now
everything is different.

217
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,850
You see this mouse motion,
this is the fraudster

218
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,704
actually using remote access.

219
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,790
When you use remote access,
there are some delays

220
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,959
in the hand eye coordination,

221
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,540
the mouse is very jumpy and disrupted.

222
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,020
That's because of the remote access.

223
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,890
The user can be in the UK but the attacker

224
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,956
could be anywhere around the world.

225
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:56,410
The numpad was used all of the sudden

226
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,819
instead of the keypad for
entering amount information.

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,860
So the bottom line is,
many, many differences

228
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,580
in the behavior post log-in.

229
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,770
The session was essentially hijacked

230
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,949
and this is a very typical
case of social engineering.

231
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,800
Tricking the user to install
something on their device,

232
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,683
allowing the fraudster
to use remote access.

233
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,556
Something else that we see
mainly in the U.S. these days,

234
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,160
it's a call coming from the fraud team.

235
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,232
Essentially it's part of
a longer cycle of fraud.

236
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:32,020
The fraudsters basically obtains
a lot of PII information.

237
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,812
Phone, phone number names,

238
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:37,530
social security numbers, et cetera

239
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,209
for the account holders
of a specific bank.

240
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,957
Then using some robot texts
sending a lot of text messages,

241
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:45,470
"Hey, we see some suspicious transaction."

242
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,327
User replies, "Yeah, I
didn't do this transaction."

243
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:51,804
And now the fraud team
is calling the user.

244
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:55,240
"There was also not just
these suspicious transactions,

245
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,600
but also a suspicious login
done from the same area.

246
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,433
Was it you?"

247
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,367
And the user says, "No, it wasn't me."

248
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:05,300
"Oh, so we have to reset
your account right now.

249
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,250
We're gonna send you a one-time code,

250
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,900
just read the code to us, and
then we can reset your account

251
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,230
and everything will be fine."

252
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,140
By that time user is very, very convinced

253
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,680
that it is the real fraud team

254
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,872
of the bank providing the OTP.

255
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,800
What the fraudster is doing obviously

256
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
is resetting the password.

257
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,060
User is locked out and
it's basically game over

258
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,439
at this point because
fraudster is now fully

259
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,732
in control over that
online banking account.

260
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:34,550
They can enroll the user to Zelle.

261
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,359
They can make payments,
Zelle is this P2P scheme

262
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,568
that is very popular
these days in the U.S.,

263
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:46,568
so essentially that's the
way the fraud is being done.

264
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,379
Now, we actually got our
hands on an actual recording

265
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:56,351
that was done by one
of the gangs attacking

266
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,400
a credit union in the U.S.

267
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,293
So I'm gonna play that recording to you.

268
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,150
The source is a US-based credit union.

269
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,340
You're gonna see a Zelle fraudster talking

270
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,870
to a potential victim

271
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,170
and explaining them exactly what to do.

272
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,949
It was start by telling them

273
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,540
what their social security number is,

274
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,209
just to establish that
it's indeed the bank having

275
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,610
that conversation with them.

276
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:22,314
- [Client] But I just don't know you,

277
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't give you my
social security number.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,130
- [Fraudster] No, no,
no, mister Listenburgh

279
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,900
We're not asking for your
social security number.

280
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,490
I can tell you your social
security number, sir.

281
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,670
I can verify with you.

282
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,641
- [Client] Okay, what is my number?

283
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,350
- [Fraudster] Okay, I do have
your social security in here,

284
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,550
Mr. Listenburgh, it's
five, two, four, four.

285
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:41,672
- [Client] Yeah.

286
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:43,570
- [Fraudster] Want to go
ahead and secure your account?

287
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,065
Your account was used in Pennsylvania

288
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:51,065
at a Target for the amount of $1,645.95.

289
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,860
- [Client] Yeah, I really
appreciate your time.

290
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,027
Can I call you back?

291
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:57,427
Do you have a call number
so I can (indistinct)?

292
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,650
- [Fraudster] Not to cut you off,

293
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,110
I do wanna go ahead and inform you

294
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,790
that I do have a
representative on the phone

295
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,560
with another client claiming
to be you, Mr. Listenburgh.

296
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,270
So we do have to make an outbound call

297
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,579
to speak the cardholder.

298
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,860
Just in case somebody get called in

299
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,160
and try to compose as you, sir and try

300
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,819
to push through those transactions.

301
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,240
That's the reason for that
outbound call today, okay?

302
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,400
- [Client] Sounds great,
so let me call you back.

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,810
So I take my debit card
on the back side of that

304
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,928
I find the phone number
and then I call you back.

305
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:24,910
- [Fraudster] You're not listening,

306
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,610
you're not listening, Mr. Listenburgh,

307
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,060
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

308
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,670
I just told you, we have
to make an outbound call

309
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,339
due to the fact somebody
called in and posed as you,

310
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,330
trying to pursue those transactions.

311
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,180
I did verify here your
social security number

312
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,859
and I did verify your birth year.

313
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,640
Are you aware of any of these transaction

314
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,427
that took place today in
Pennsylvania, Mr. Listenburgh?

315
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,690
- [Client] No, I'm not, I don't
authorize the (indistinct).

316
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,190
- [Fraudster] Now, Mr. Listenburgh,

317
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,870
have you authorized anybody
in the State of Pennsylvania

318
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,680
to access your online banking account

319
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
in the last 24 to 48 hours, sir?

320
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,079
- [Client] No.

321
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,340
- [Fraudster] Okay, so for
your protection I'm actually

322
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,350
going to go ahead and put a temporary hold

323
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,850
on that online banking,
due to the fact somebody

324
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,970
did access your online banking account

325
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,597
from a Pennsylvania location.

326
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,530
- [Client] Okay.

327
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,500
- [Fraudster] So I'm
actually gonna go ahead

328
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,730
and begin on their hard reset

329
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,210
for that online banking account,

330
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,580
so once you do log back in

331
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,767
you'll be able to create a new password

332
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,616
so we can make sure that
your account is secure, okay?

333
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:20,640
- [Client] Okay.

334
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,473
- [Fraudster] I'm actually gonna go ahead

335
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:23,420
and send you a mobile verification code

336
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,073
to the number ending in 8101.

337
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,787
You can go ahead and repeat
it once you do receive it.

338
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,390
- So as you have heard,

339
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,077
this is very, very clever
social engineering well done.

340
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:38,720
And essentially I would
say quite convincing.

341
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,010
- So here we have an example

342
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,090
of what we would see on the online side

343
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,060
of the phone call that
we just listened to.

344
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,608
So this is, the screenshot
we're looking at

345
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:49,729
is the user session journeying.

346
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,120
So they log into the banking session.

347
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,530
They access their dashboard,
which is the second step.

348
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,699
And then this particular user goes

349
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,240
through the Zelle enrollment process.

350
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,272
The bank requires the
user to enter an OTP code,

351
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:05,540
which you could hear the
fraudster was asking the victim

352
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,750
for over the phone.

353
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,760
So the purpose is to enter that OTP code

354
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,120
and complete Zelle enrollment.

355
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,590
They're not actually helping the victim.

356
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,730
In this case we also see a
contact information change.

357
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,020
There's some time spent on that page

358
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,030
immediately after Zelle enrollment.

359
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,350
So even if I'm looking at
these pieces of information,

360
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,950
we see a Zelle enrollment,
the user enters OTP

361
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,080
with no issue whatsoever,
and then immediately changes

362
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,880
their contact information
after enrolling to Zelle.

363
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,513
That on its own is not much to go on.

364
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,257
So let's take a deeper
look at the behaviors.

365
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,729
Within this particular
session we're seeing

366
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,460
some key behaviors that stand out

367
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,420
that don't look like the behaviors

368
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,949
of the genuine user based
on their past sessions.

369
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,590
So the user starts using the arrow keys.

370
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,260
Historically this
particular user is always

371
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,551
using the mouse scroll wheel

372
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,810
to navigate to scroll up and down.

373
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,405
But in this case we see the arrow keys

374
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,540
being used quite a bit

375
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,790
where the user has almost
never used arrow keys.

376
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,770
Additionally, we see high rate of deleting

377
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,430
which this user doesn't typically do.

378
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,930
So we're seeing a lot of
corrections being made.

379
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,210
So these are both anomalous
for this particular user

380
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,040
based on their past history.

381
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,629
We see a change in how
the user is scrolling

382
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,890
from mouse wheel now to arrows.

383
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,839
There's excessive deleting.

384
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,220
So there's a lot of
corrections being made.

385
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,770
They've made a contact information change.

386
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,680
They've enrolled in a new
P2P real-time payment method,

387
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,910
which we know is a high target for fraud.

388
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,010
So this is a recipe for,
we wanna take a second look

389
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,003
and perhaps validate this user
outside of just the OTP code.

390
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:49,631
- Yeah, the closest real
fraud case that I came across

391
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,250
when thinking about the
same sort of first story

392
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,130
of the Red-Headed League is this one.

393
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,366
This is from the UK,
it's corporate banking.

394
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:04,366
One of the customers of online
banking, a major online bank

395
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:09,330
in the UK is normally coming
from the same location,

396
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,449
the same device, they're doing high amount

397
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,210
international transfers
because it's a business.

398
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,837
There's a specific transaction,

399
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:18,420
$2 million going to a new beneficiary.

400
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,021
But again, this is normal
for this specific business.

401
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:26,139
Now, what we can see is
that it's the typical

402
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,563
sort of user behavior.

403
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,380
We can see that the way they
normally operate is normal.

404
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,853
We see smooth hand eye coordination here.

405
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,322
We see that when they type
information it's normal.

406
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,400
And whenever they're selecting
let's say the country

407
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,060
for international destinations,
they use the mouse for that.

408
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,760
This is the regular user
doing the transaction.

409
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,846
But now when we look at
this specific transaction,

410
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:59,330
the $2 million transfer,
everything is off.

411
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,106
Let's first look at the mouse motion here.

412
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:04,640
You can see it's very strange.

413
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,070
Almost like the data is distorted somehow.

414
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,970
This is because it's
done using remote access.

415
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,010
The other thing is the
behavior itself is different.

416
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,800
For example, selecting
the country is now done

417
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,700
using the keyboard rather
than using the mouse.

418
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,980
So as you can see this is quite different

419
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,860
in terms of the behavior.

420
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,919
Now behind the scenes what's going on is

421
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,880
there is some malware,
specifically that was Dridex.

422
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,670
As the user was going to the bank

423
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,165
they were automatically
directed to a fake website.

424
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:32,315
At that fake website,

425
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,661
which is a little bit like
the Red-Headed League,

426
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,950
they were given some sort of task,

427
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,590
almost like copying the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

428
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,743
So now they're spending
time in that fake website.

429
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
The fraudster now has
their login credentials.

430
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,949
They're logging in using remote access

431
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,361
from their computer onto the bank.

432
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,420
When they actually do
the transaction they need

433
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,580
to do like a challenge response.

434
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,530
No problem, they go to that fake website

435
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,580
and present that challenge in real time,

436
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,929
user solve the challenge
for them and continues.

437
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,760
So essentially here social
engineering is being used

438
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,850
to distract the user and
give the user something to do

439
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,176
as the fraudster is actually
doing the transaction

440
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,533
from their computer.

441
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,320
So this is essentially what we see here.

442
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,939
And the last piece before we move on

443
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,050
to the more nefarious
types of social engineering

444
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,159
is this one, I call it the curious case

445
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,540
of the Straw company.

446
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,600
This is an e-commerce
company, pretty innocent.

447
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,620
They sell premium quality paper straws.

448
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,379
You can buy a crate if
you're like a big restaurant

449
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,679
but this is a very, very big order.

450
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,420
62 crates, many, many straws,

451
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,420
costing $15,000 plus $10,000
for urgent shipping to Tuvalu.

452
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,670
What is Tuvalu?

453
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,030
Welcome to Tuvalu.

454
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,020
It's an Island in the
Pacific ocean, 11,000 people.

455
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,550
They actually don't need that many straws.

456
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,930
From the data itself
it's quite suspicious,

457
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,150
but I can tell you that even

458
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,220
without knowing any of that data,

459
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,933
you could look at some of the behavior

460
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,264
that the user is demonstrating

461
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:09,159
and see something is off.

462
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,920
So essentially, if I kind
of run the session for you,

463
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,130
you're gonna see the user
pasting some of the information.

464
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,010
Credit cards some people paste,

465
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,860
but the incriminating piece
here is pasting the zip code.

466
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,693
And I can tell you, it actually shows

467
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:26,420
very low familiarity with the data.

468
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,440
In the U.S. people just know
the five digit zip code.

469
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,680
You don't paste it, you just
type it, it's far easier.

470
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,220
So as you can see,
combination of what we know

471
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,540
about the transaction

472
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,170
but also what we know about the behavior.

473
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,350
And that was a part of an attack.

474
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,169
Why was it social engineering?

475
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,260
The actual attack was very interesting.

476
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,323
So let's actually understand that point.

477
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:49,470
After the transaction went through,

478
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,380
it was $25,000 altogether.

479
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,760
It was authorized by
the credit card company.

480
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,577
At that point, the criminal
called the merchant and said,

481
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,290
"Hey, I made a terrible mistake.

482
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,970
I didn't realize it's so expensive

483
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,700
to ship to Tuvalu, $10,000, this is crazy.

484
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,070
I found another company.

485
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,040
They can do it for $2,000.

486
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,899
Can you do me a favor?

487
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,507
Because I already paid
you all of that money,

488
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,290
$10,000 for the shipping.

489
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,790
Can you pass the $10,000 to their account

490
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,360
and they'll handle this transaction

491
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,929
and then they'll handle any other shipping

492
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,880
that we'll be using with you guys."

493
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,713
And the merchant said,

494
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:27,310
"Yeah, already got the money, so okay,

495
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm gonna send $10,000 to
that shipping company."

496
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,340
Of course, non-existent shipping company.

497
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,080
It was just an account
that the criminal opened up

498
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,310
in the U.S., so that was a very clever

499
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,580
social engineering story.

500
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,250
At the end of the day the
fraudster had a credit card

501
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,400
and they got $10,000 using

502
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,270
this clever social engineering story.

503
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,230
But now we're gonna talk
about deep social engineering.

504
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,990
So, let's actually talk
about a very specific call

505
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,960
that happened a few years ago in the UK.

506
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,965
Someone got a phone call
from their mobile provider.

507
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,409
"Hey, you're late on your fees.

508
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,560
Can you please pay?"

509
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,089
And she makes payments
with her debit card.

510
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:09,582
Then five minutes later
the bank is calling,

511
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,530
"We see a suspicious transaction.

512
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,363
Can you explain?"

513
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:13,897
And she says, "Yeah,
it's my mobile carrier."

514
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:15,610
"No, it's not, you paid someone,

515
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,285
but it's certainly not
your mobile provider.

516
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:23,150
Unfortunately, that was
fraud, but don't worry.

517
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,020
We'll have to switch you
to a new bank account

518
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,220
because you use your debit card,

519
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,330
it's connected bank account.

520
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,720
To be on the safe side, please log in.

521
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,590
We'll give you a new bank account number

522
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,689
and move all of your money to
this new bank account number."

523
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,927
People that are listening
probably grin and say,

524
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,679
"Hey, obviously she
did not fall for that."

525
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,174
But she did.

526
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,930
So you can see the login, and
then you can see everything

527
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,030
that happened after that.

528
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,030
This is the real person doing
this, it's not someone else.

529
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:59,493
So that's a very, very
interesting sort of question.

530
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,410
This sort of problem, is it that big?

531
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,000
Is it that problematic let's say?

532
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,090
If we follow the online
banking fraud losses

533
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,149
in the UK, it started in 2004, 2006.

534
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,210
You see this surging
fraud, that was phishing,

535
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,780
back in the Phishing days.

536
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,550
But then in 2017 the entire
industry cracked the case

537
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,490
by using strongest indication.

538
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,890
Now every transaction,

539
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,340
every login is now
strongly authenticating,

540
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,233
using OTPs, using smart
cards and stuff like that.

541
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:39,349
The entire UK market is
now strongly authenticated.

542
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,360
And then 2008 something happened.

543
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,639
The UK market moved to faster payments.

544
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,490
Now money moves instantly
to the other bank.

545
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,830
You can see the impact on fraud.

546
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,510
It basically tripled, despite the fact

547
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,340
that all of these transactions
were strongly authenticated.

548
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Now 2011, 2013, there is
this anti-malware capability

549
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,980
that the banks deployed, that
kind of helped the situation.

550
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,820
But you can see that after a few years

551
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,619
the fraudsters have new toolkits,

552
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,050
essentially remote access attacks

553
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,879
and some deep social, sorry
rail social engineering

554
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,510
that are mixed with that.

555
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,390
And you can see that fraud
is beginning to surge again.

556
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,540
2016 the bank started to
deploy behavioral biometrics,

557
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,520
mainly basically all of the large banks

558
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,560
in the UK are using this these days

559
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,444
to look at the way the user is behaving

560
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,149
in the transaction itself.

561
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,070
And you can see the impact
on overall fraud losses.

562
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,700
But I'm cheating a little
bit because I'm not counting

563
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,062
one thing that started to
happen a few years ago.

564
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:46,629
Authorized push payments.

565
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,610
If actually count that as well you can see

566
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,800
that for all still on the increase.

567
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,490
Authorized push payments
is this exact story

568
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,930
where the victim itself is being tricked

569
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,020
to move money from their account,

570
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,520
using a very, very clever story.

571
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,290
Is this even fraud?

572
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,250
No, it's a scam.

573
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,860
You know, it's almost
like walking in the street

574
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,090
and someone will convince
you to hand off some money.

575
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,990
Should banks refund the users?

576
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,270
Actually, the banks
got a lot of complaints

577
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,177
from consumer groups and the
regulars at some point said,

578
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,770
"You have to make the user whole,

579
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,626
you actually have to find
this specific problem."

580
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:26,379
It became a social issue,
preying on the elderly,

581
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,630
the vulnerable, and the
banks are now expected

582
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,090
to handle the situation.

583
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,250
And if there is any kind of
a fraud loss for the user,

584
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,010
even if it's a fully
authorized transaction,

585
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,013
now the user has to do that.

586
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,720
Now the bank has to make the user whole

587
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,640
and refund those lost transactions.

588
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,690
Now it started in the UK, then
spread into the Netherlands.

589
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,150
And in 2020 it was seen in
many other parts of the world,

590
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,786
some of the early signs
in North America as well.

591
00:26:57,786 --> 00:27:01,563
- So, how do we detect this type of fraud?

592
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,990
I mean, we're seeing strong
authentication coming

593
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,310
from a trusted device, no use of malware,

594
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,840
no nefarious use or remote
access tool, no bots.

595
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,360
We're looking at the
genuine user interacting

596
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
in the online session.

597
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,852
There's no criminal in sight.

598
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,053
So, maybe we see a longer
than normal session.

599
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,400
Maybe we see payments to new beneficiaries

600
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,050
but that's not a whole lot to go on.

601
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,580
So how, the false positive rate

602
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,733
must be disastrous based on this data.

603
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,290
- So you need to look for
the subtle marks, Watson,

604
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,800
Consider this.

605
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,750
If you actually deeply
look at those sessions,

606
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,290
here's what you see.

607
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,247
Remember that the person was told,

608
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:49,760
"Hey, we need to give you
a new bank account number."

609
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,930
What happens is that she
was actually told to wait

610
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,710
until the money is in
that new bank account.

611
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,020
Like wait for confirmation.

612
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,110
These are typically very long calls.

613
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,070
During that time this
is what she was doing.

614
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,960
If you actually look at the
mouse motion on the screen

615
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,350
she was doodling on the screen randomly,

616
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,129
aimlessly wandering on the
screen for five minutes.

617
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,630
I can literally show it for five minutes.

618
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,240
Why is she doing that?

619
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,410
She was told to wait.

620
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,180
She has nothing else to do.

621
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,880
She doesn't wanna go out of the computer

622
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,410
because it's a very stressful situation.

623
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,140
Maybe the session will close or something.

624
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,440
So essentially she keeps herself busy

625
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,870
by doing these random
motions of the mouse.

626
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,820
But hey, this is online banking, right?

627
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,200
It's not an entertainment system.

628
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,050
Why is the user doing this?

629
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,073
This is because the user
is heavily distracted.

630
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:41,600
They're not actually focused
on online banking anymore.

631
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,439
They're focused on the story
around the whole scene.

632
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,818
So a much higher percentage
of the session is spent

633
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:52,070
just wandering aimlessly,
showing lack of focus.

634
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,570
The other small subtle sign is hesitation.

635
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,990
So when you actually click to submit,

636
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,050
your finger goes to the submit button,

637
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,310
using the left click of the mouse,

638
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,080
and then you release the finger.

639
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,689
It typically takes you around
120 milliseconds to do that.

640
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,580
But if you are under duress,
if something is telling you

641
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,280
what to do, or you're under duress,

642
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,290
typically you'll be much more hesitant.

643
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,780
Sometimes, like Jabez in
the red-headed league story

644
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,152
you might even suspect
that something is off.

645
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:26,140
Am I really releasing this big payment?

646
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,620
Am I pretty sure that it's okay?

647
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,879
So there is a greater degree
of subconscious hesitation

648
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,820
and this is what the banks see

649
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,883
when they look at those transactions.

650
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,983
So cognitive actions
take longer to complete.

651
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,790
The other thing is being guided.

652
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,858
This is a regular mobile device

653
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:47,679
during mobile banking session.

654
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,850
So people typically hold
the device pretty steadily.

655
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,699
As they tap on the device the
device shifts a little bit.

656
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,030
This is the accelerometer data.

657
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,280
You can see small shifts
as the destination accounts

658
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,889
for example is being typed.

659
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,940
But now let's imagine a deep
social engineering scenario.

660
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,440
Someone is on the phone
telling you what to do,

661
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,050
telling you what the new
bank account is, for example.

662
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,030
So you're basically listening
to instructions, right?

663
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,350
So the device will be close to your ear

664
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,679
and then you move the device
like this so you can type.

665
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,830
You listen, you then move
the device, you type.

666
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,060
The device moves all the time.

667
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,810
This is very irregular.

668
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,720
It basically shows that
you're being guided.

669
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,880
Someone's telling you
where to send the money to.

670
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,550
The thing is that none of these are

671
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:34,230
on their own very powerful indicators.

672
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,633
So how do we actually go
about solving the crime?

673
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,705
We have to integrate all
of those weak signals

674
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,830
in a way that matters.

675
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,810
- All right, well, let me
take a crack at this one.

676
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,020
So in this case, we're
seeing a session from a user.

677
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,840
We have two different scores.

678
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,530
We have an ATO risk score,
which is 368, considered low,

679
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,440
and a voice scam risk score
940, which is considered high.

680
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,610
Which score should I use?

681
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,443
Well, let's take a look

682
00:31:04,443 --> 00:31:05,900
at what's happening within the session.

683
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,050
So in this case, what we're looking at

684
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,700
in the middle of the screen
is the session activity,

685
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,270
the typing activity.

686
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,600
The user is typing in the sort code

687
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,169
and the account number for payment.

688
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,410
What's interesting are the pauses

689
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,780
between each typing interaction.

690
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,440
So this indicates the user
is waiting for dictation.

691
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,940
So they're only typing a couple of digits,

692
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,210
maybe up to four digits at a time

693
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,470
in the account number, with
long pauses in between.

694
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,000
The long pause at the end
of typing the account number

695
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,830
indicates perhaps the user's
reciting the account number

696
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,473
back to someone else.

697
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,400
This information stands out.

698
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,240
The graph we're looking at on the right,

699
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,400
the red dot represents
this particular session

700
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,870
and the typing speed.

701
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,091
So we see the typing speed
is significantly slower

702
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,889
than the blue shape on the left

703
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,320
which represents the general population.

704
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,429
So the user is actually
typing the sort code

705
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,680
and the account number much slower

706
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,910
than both this user typically would,

707
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,713
and the genuine population.

708
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,600
So the slower than normal typing speed,

709
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
the pauses in between typing
the data within the session.

710
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,990
It's not a lot to go on.

711
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,340
So what do we see next is an
hour later a second session,

712
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,830
this is the same user.

713
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,629
Again, we're seeing
that low ATO risk score

714
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,350
and high voice scam score.

715
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,159
So in this particular session
we can see in this transcript,

716
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,047
the user's scrolling up and
down with the mouse wheel,

717
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:43,050
which is pretty interesting.

718
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,540
So the graphs on the right we're seeing,

719
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,550
the red dot again represents
this specific session

720
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,899
compared to the general population.

721
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,740
There's a much higher rate of backward

722
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,530
and forward scrolling from
this particular session.

723
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,550
So there's not really a need for the user

724
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,389
to scroll at this rate within the session.

725
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,040
So that's pretty far off the norm.

726
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,040
It seems to align with what
Sherlock's talking about

727
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,490
as methods of distraction
that are occurring

728
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,020
within the session, all
at the point of payment.

729
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,830
Again, going back to the mouse click

730
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,460
that Sherlock was talking about,

731
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,470
we're looking at the graphs
below are the mouse clicks

732
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,950
for this user during the payment process.

733
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,270
So the graph on the lower
left is the men key press

734
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,220
compared with the general population.

735
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,270
So they're pressing the
keys much more slowly

736
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,629
than what we typically see from users.

737
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,210
And the one on the right is submitting.

738
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,890
So there is a pause before
they submit this payment.

739
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,680
So that's hesitation.

740
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,180
So if we look at these
particular behaviors

741
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,835
at key points within the payment process

742
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:51,956
where the user is
hesitating and distracting

743
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:54,815
while they're entering
their payment detail,

744
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,693
I think this is bad.

745
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:04,680
- Yeah, so you're absolutely
correct, Dr. Watson.

746
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,600
And these are exactly the
sort of the small clues

747
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,350
that we have to look at.

748
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,350
If I compare our methods with
any other detective teams

749
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,250
out there, many of the
detective teams are looking

750
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,556
for the small thing that doesn't fit.

751
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:28,545
The way we do this, Dr. Watson and myself,

752
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:31,889
we're basically looking
at many, many small facts

753
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,886
and add them together and say,

754
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,674
"The whole thing doesn't make sense."

755
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:39,469
So it's the smallest of things.

756
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,669
Let's call them micro-behaviors.

757
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,880
Very, very interesting micro-behaviors.

758
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,239
You have to collect hundreds
of those micro-behaviors

759
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,464
and risk factors.

760
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:50,900
Each of them will be a weak predictor.

761
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,219
So the fact that you
see, for example guidance

762
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,469
that doesn't mean it's bad.

763
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,439
The fact that you see hesitation
doesn't mean it's bad.

764
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,620
If you combine a lot of these into a model

765
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,960
using machine learning classifiers,
now you have something.

766
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,350
Now you have this powerful predictor,

767
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,410
almost trying to
replicate what's going on,

768
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,413
on Sherlock's head.

769
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,650
And essentially that's the way the banks

770
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,770
in the UK are fighting deep
social engineering these days.

771
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,170
So quite interesting and quite
a journey from the early days

772
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,480
of just using transaction
monitoring or looking at devices,

773
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,755
you actually look at human behavior.

774
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:31,450
And because we talk
about social engineering

775
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,419
and certainly deep social engineering

776
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,554
that's essentially the
thing that would help

777
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:41,283
in those nefarious crimes.

778
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,590
- So in summary, we've discussed two types

779
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,547
of social engineerings, with
the old tried and true method.

780
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:50,480
So the current trends that
we're seeing at a high rate

781
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,440
where users are doing data harvesting,

782
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,441
convincing genuine users to
install remote access tools.

783
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:59,740
Someone calling to pretend to be the bank

784
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,783
to access OTP codes.

785
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:04,779
Use of a Trojan attack or malware

786
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,000
to distract the user, collect OTPs.

787
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,010
And now we have deep social engineering,

788
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,630
a whole new type of crime.

789
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,350
So this is where we're seeing
users being guided into,

790
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,190
the victim themselves are guided

791
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,640
into sending money
directly to the criminal.

792
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,520
We see a trusted device.

793
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,220
We see no malware, no nefarious
use of remote access tool,

794
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,569
no criminal activity.

795
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,290
We're really looking

796
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,650
at the genuine user
interacting the session.

797
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,430
So it's a fully authorized transaction.

798
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,522
It's not really fraud, but
regulators are demanding action.

799
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
So let's apply what we've learned today.

800
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,170
Next week we recommend
identifying the controls you have

801
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,900
versus regular deep social engineering.

802
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,060
Perform a gap analysis and
define the desired end-game.

803
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,490
In the first three months
Following this presentation

804
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,149
we recommend creating an action plan

805
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,510
for addressing those gaps,
talking to your peers

806
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,276
about the best mix of
technology and processes.

807
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:05,919
Educate senior stakeholders
about the reputational risk

808
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,220
of authorized push payment fraud.

809
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,390
And within six months
we recommend securing

810
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,955
a 2022 budget for handling
deep social engineering

811
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:17,380
and launch a program to evaluate
battle-tested technologies

812
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,930
that can help fill the gaps.

813
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,484
- So that's it.

814
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:24,263
We do hope that you
enjoyed our presentation.

815
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,950

And thank you for your time

817
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:37,147
and hope you enjoy the
rest of our RSA Conference.

818
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,397
- Thanks everyone.
- Cheers.
