00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,700
- Hello, I'm James Carder,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,440
Chief Security Officer for logarithm

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,950
and Vice-President of logarithm labs.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,620
Thank you for choosing to
attend our presentation today

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,930
on our zero trust journey,
the successes, the failures,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,710
and hopefully dodge some
pitfalls that we actually made

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,493
on our journey to have you
do it better than we did.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,057
So from an agenda perspective today,

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,189
I'm gonna provide a zero trust refresh.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,600
We'll talk about how we implemented
our reserve trust model.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,259
We'll look back at some of the,

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,349
again, successes and failures

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,060
and then hopefully
leave you some resources

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,640
that way you can start your
own zero trust implementation.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
I will say that we're not gonna go

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,720
into a deep dive about zero trust.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,160
I'm just gonna make an assumption

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,510
that if you are attending
this presentation

19
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:49,821
you understand the concept of zero trust

20
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,960
and really just focus this presentation

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,523
on our journey along the way.

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,760
So, what is Zero Trust?

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,140
Really it takes all the
pieces of your workflow

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,340
from your users, to your systems,

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,250
your applications, to your data,

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,810
your network traffic, system applications,

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,610
the applications and it
breaks them all apart

28
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,970
into separate identity
perimeters or microperimeters.

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,370
I think the key here though

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,110
is that inherently trust is not present

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,840
by just having one of
those microperimeters

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,940
or identity perimeters being trusted.

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,520
So you have to trust all of it

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,336
but there's inherently no trust until

35
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,929
all of the pieces fit in.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,310
Is founded by Forrester

37
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,870
and the most notably implemented by Google

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,670
with their BeyondCorp model.

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,225
I think whenever it was implemented

40
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:46,119
and founded by Forrester,

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,900
really, it was a lot of
concept, strategy, theory

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,570
around how to actually do it.

43
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,690
And it became a reality

44
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,679
when Google actually implemented
their BeyondCorp model.

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,010
And the Google BeyondCorp model

46
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,706
is actually the model that
we followed as well loosely.

47
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:02,840
And it's the most notable
model that a lot of folks

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,250
who are implementing Zero
Trust for the first time

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,780
follow as well.

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,460
It's been around for a decade.

51
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,539
I like to say, it took a pandemic

52
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,109
for it to become more of a reality

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,130
and less of a buzz word or an
aspirational goal for most,

54
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,460
this proof point around force or inquiries

55
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,010
that we confirmed with them

56
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,709
that they've had a 3x
inquiry number for Zero Trust

57
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,380
in the last year than they
have in previous years.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,810
All based on the pandemic remote workforce

59
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,073
and the necessity to be more Zero Trust.

60
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,149
So I like to jokingly call Zero Trust,

61
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,601
the Titanic Principle.

62
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,670
There was a famous Peter Drucker quote

63
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,375
where he says that strategy will eat,

64
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,895
Our culture will eat
strategy for breakfast

65
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,820
and I think that's true

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,290
for most large projects or engagements

67
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,340
but especially true when
you're looking at Zero Trust.

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,780
When I think of the Titanic,

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,240
I think of the, you know, strategy around,

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,735
what they wanted to do in the
architecture and the theory of

71
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,900
being able to compartmentalize
the entire bottom

72
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,843
of a boat, the hole of the boat

73
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,970
in a way to where if a breach

74
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,890
of a one part of it would
just flood a compartment

75
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,679
without actually
compromising the entire boat.

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,360
And as we all know, the Titanic sank.

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,570
So, you know, a lot

78
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,460
of times I look at that as
the strategy being sound

79
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,030
but the execution may have lacked.

80
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,570
And if you think about
Zero Trust, we're really

81
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,109
breaking all these different
things into microperimeters.

82
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,410
And so it's the same concept
where we're looking at

83
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,210
if a attacker can compromise a user

84
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,630
or a system or an application,
they should be contained

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,670
within that and not be able to spread out

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,709
and cause a catastrophic
breach for your business.

87
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,310
So that's how I relate
Zero Trust at the Titanic.

88
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,143
A lot of people laugh

89
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,540
at that just because the Titanic did sink.

90
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,030
And I think the key takeaway here is,

91
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,510
your strategy may be sound

92
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,709
but it's how you execute
that actually matters,

93
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,183
as it relates to Zero Trust.

94
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,829
So our implementation of Zero Trust,

95
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,883
it took us about four years.

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,100
I would like to think

97
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,530
that we could have done it a lot sooner.

98
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,240
I think if all the stars aligned

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,209
it would have happened a lot sooner.

100
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,229
And I think today you
could actually probably go

101
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,950
from nothing to full
Zero Trust implementation

102
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,330
and definitely less than a
year, but it took us four years.

103
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,909
And there's a lot of reasons
why it took us four years.

104
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,390
I think some of the
reasons relate to the fact

105
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,650
that the technology back in 2017

106
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,690
wasn't really a Zero Trust enabled.

107
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,660
It wasn't really built
with Zero Trust in mind.

108
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,930
And so you may have had
these security technologies

109
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,770
that were available at the time, but,

110
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,270
and then, you know, they would latched

111
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,030
onto the Zero Trust buzzword
and try to talk to you

112
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,140
about how their product
is the Zero Trust product.

113
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,479
And that's just not the case.

114
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,690
There was no real all in
one Zero Trust product

115
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,040
out there outside of
what Google implemented

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,390
with BeyondCorp is stuff
that they developed.

117
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,060
So really, you know

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,860
if you're looking at
how do I implement this

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,610
you're having a leverage
commercially available

120
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,960
off the shelf products to
be able to piece together.

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,430
And I kind of joke when I say
Frankenstein them together

122
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,367
because again, if they're
not built for Zero Trust

123
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,930
and we're trying to make
them do Zero Trust things

124
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,030
with other technologies that
weren't built for Zero Trust,

125
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,320
it can be challenging.

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
So when I look at 2017, even 2018,

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,110
really the technology wasn't mature enough

128
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,253
in Zero Trust side to be able
to do this well or easily.

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,920
But you'll see here a four year journey

130
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,020
And you'll also notice in 2019

131
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,500
I call out a re-evaluation assessment year

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,660
primarily that's because,
you know, we had a number

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,110
of changes that occur
within our business in 2019

134
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,830
but also 2019 was a strong year

135
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,085
for technology to
actually be mature enough

136
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,850
to be able to support and
enable companies that want to go

137
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,430
down the Zero Trust path.

138
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,130
And so if I showed you our
architecture from when we started

139
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,130
in 2017 and what we designed
late 2017, early 2018

140
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,349
and what we have implemented
today, it's night and day.

141
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,900
There are very few pieces that actually

142
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,250
stayed the same throughout
that entire journey.

143
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,050
So why don't we go down this path?

144
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,380
Well I think for us,

145
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,670
we're probably the
perfect size organization.

146
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,452
I think size and complexity matters

147
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,519
relates to implementing Zero Trust.

148
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,220
If you're a 50,000, 100,000,
200,000-employee company.

149
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,230
You've been around for a
100 years, you've got lots

150
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,700
of legacy process
intertwined with IT systems

151
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,380
and really having to like
pull all that stuff apart

152
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,110
being able to support both
the legacy, the custom apps

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,560
that your organizations
developed, et cetera

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,220
and all the processes are tied to,

155
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,540
can be daunting and having
to unwind all of that

156
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,470
and then basically
rewind it back together.

157
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,680
So for us, we were a smaller organization.

158
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,340
We were around 600 employees.

159
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,979
We have minimal legacy technology.

160
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,310
So we have, we're about 90%
SAS as a part of our operation.

161
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,910
And we're a security first company,

162
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,850
meaning that the appetite

163
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,623
and acceptance of security friction

164
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,933
in the name of security and reducing

165
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:14,760
of risk corporate risk is acceptable

166
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,770
within our business model

167
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,260
because we want to set the standard

168
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,780
as a security company of
how security should be done.

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,770
And so we all, that's
ingrained in our culture.

170
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,599
And so that's what made it, that serve us

171
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,460
the perfect candidate, right
fit to go down this path

172
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,275
How we got started is interesting,

173
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:35,940
People always sort of like question us,

174
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,160
but GDPR is how we got started.

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,080
And the reason why I say that
is because when GDPR came out

176
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,729
in 2017 enforcement 2018, we had to,

177
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,853
you had to take a number of activities

178
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,640
as a part of your business.

179
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,610
You had to map all your flows to PII data.

180
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,320
You had to understand how
users access PII data.

181
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,560
You had to understand
how systems access to it,

182
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,310
where it was stored, how to get rid of it.

183
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,250
So we figured, hey, if
we're already having to

184
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,760
map this entire sort of
workflow and chain together

185
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,860
for GDPR raise to PII.

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,830
Why wouldn't we do this
for our most critical

187
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,780
business systems or critical
or toxic data that if, you know

188
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,530
we were, you know,
inadvertently disclose or

189
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,000
if we had issues and experience a breach

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,648
and those particular things,
or just had outages in those

191
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:30,010
things that actually
stop revenue generation

192
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,520
or impact the brand or the business.

193
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,140
And so we, you know, combining
GDPR with a traditional sort

194
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,390
of business impact assessment
is really where we got started

195
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,789
with generating our
requirements for Zero Trust.

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,530
So when I look at our architecture
for Zero Trust, you know,

197
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,930
this is very typical of
the Google BeyondCorp model

198
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,180
with a Data Plane and Control Plane.

199
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,189
As you can see in the control plane here,

200
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,780
we've inventories as a part mapping all

201
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,050
of our users and all the
workflows, et cetera.

202
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,170
We have all the devices that are trusted.

203
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,780
We have an inventory of all
those devices and inventory

204
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,439
of the users that are
trusted and other attributes

205
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,810
whether it be on the mobile device

206
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,989
or whatever the case is
that will infer trust.

207
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,350
And really, you know, these
two planes work together

208
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,010
and they're all brokered
through a access proxy

209
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,750
or policy broker before they
get allowed or denied access.

210
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,370
And so as a user, you know

211
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,647
your user has to be trusted
because you have to authenticate

212
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,780
that you are who you say
you are, that authenticates

213
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,260
off of the control plane, the
device has to authenticate

214
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,260
and also carry the attributes
to infer trust for the device.

215
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,239
Then you can actually get all the roles

216
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,600
permissions and everything else
for the device and the user

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,820
and then that brokers your access

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,240
to what you need access to.

219
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,920
So it's a very simple
architecture at the end of the day

220
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,770
that all can be done

221
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,319
with commercially available
off the shelf products.

222
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,586
So I look at our Zero Trust Ecosystem,

223
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,430
it's a number of things.

224
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,109
I think one thing people always think

225
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,440
of when they implement Zero Trust is pay.

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,103
I don't need as much on
the end point anymore.

227
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:14,579
And honestly, that couldn't
be further from the truth.

228
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,370
So you know, we still
have an Endpoint stack

229
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,510
protecting our end point.

230
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,410
We have Carbon Black and Cylance to date.

231
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,410
Talking about potential
leveraging CrowdStrike as well.

232
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,290
We use Microsoft Intune
for the MDM component

233
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,680
for the Windows devices
and a product called Kandji

234
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,359
for the MDM component for our Mac systems.

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,740
We use Centrify for
Privileged Access Management.

236
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,020
You know, we are going down the path

237
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,079
of deciding between Zscaler and Palo Alto

238
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,678
but like we going with Zscaler's

239
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,670
ways to their SaaS product.

240
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,839
Just another example of technology
just now becoming ready.

241
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,220
I think SaaS was a term
coined by Gartner in 2019.

242
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,470
It wasn't around prior
to when we started this.

243
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,733
And so we originally thought
we're gonna have to go

244
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,300
leverage a CASB type product to be able to

245
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,150
do the policy brokering, but
with the sort of discovery

246
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,360
and sort of coining of
SaaS, we were able to

247
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,890
leverage a product in that set
to be able to pull that off.

248
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,900
We use Okta for Identity
Access Management.

249
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,620
And of course we use our LogRhythm SIEM

250
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,800
to do the UEBA components,

251
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,329
to do the threat intel integration,

252
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,277
to orchestration, automation and response.

253
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:26,762
And if you think about it
from a security perspective

254
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:29,439
it's really the glue that
kind of pieces these together

255
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,500
as you interact with each
of these different products

256
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,300
to be able to protect your business.

257
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,300
So Q2 2017, really all
about identifying the data.

258
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,480
We mapped all of our toxic data.

259
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,620
We identified the sources.

260
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,850
It was a part of a
business impact assessment

261
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,370
that we had conducted.

262
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,890
We mapped everything from
the users, to the system,

263
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,800
to application, to the rules.

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,632
We actually took apart,

265
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,030
a lot of people said, Oh, you know

266
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,069
Active Directory already
has a lot of this.

267
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,690
We wanted to go clean
slate and take a look at,

268
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,790
okay what if we didn't
know anything before,

269
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,560
let's follow the users and what they do,

270
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,890
let's follow the applications

271
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,010
and in a sense follow the data.

272
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,140
It's almost like following the money

273
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,580
but you follow the data.

274
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,663
And so with all of that, we
were able to redefine roles

275
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:17,380
within our systems and our company.

276
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,680
And at the same time as a part of this

277
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,479
we did the same thing with PII data,

278
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,590
so we also helped us achieve
some GDPR compliance as well.

279
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,210
But really, if you think
about the fundamental basis

280
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,360
of requirements for zero trust

281
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,930
is really around how
you map these workflows

282
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,333
with your employees, the systems
applications and the data.

283
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,160
So in Q3 2017, as I mentioned
before, we had the mapping.

284
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,800
We define all of the roles

285
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,770
and access rights and
responsibilities for each

286
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,750
of those roles I'll speak to about later.

287
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,870
but actually this was
a fundamental component

288
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,840
of being able to optimize
and create process efficiency

289
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,640
because I was able to actually,

290
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,830
once I knew how roles worked
and what they had access to,

291
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,730
we were able to do things
like automated provisioning

292
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,250
and deprovisioning of users
or move that changes work

293
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,570
and employee change from one
business unit to another.

294
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,070
The role would just shift
and we would automatically

295
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,160
reprovision the right
access and deprovision

296
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,520
everything that they had rights to before.

297
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,810
And so really it gives us very,

298
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,630
a lot of clarity around what, you know

299
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,943
all of the workflow is
within our business.

300
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,110
And combining those two really became

301
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,493
the basis of our model.

302
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,690
So in Q4, you haven't noticed
we're now three quarters in

303
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,062
and we haven't implemented a thing.

304
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:46,270
In Q4 2017, we actually
created a business plan.

305
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,850
We created a project plan.

306
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,290
We created a charter.

307
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,026
We created a budget to
show that not just the cost

308
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:56,089
of Zero Trust, but also the
cost that you can recruit

309
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,490
was the ROI that you're gonna get us

310
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,840
not just about reducing
the current state of risk

311
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,270
but there's process efficiencies

312
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,130
and there's overall cost savings as well

313
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,160
as you remove legacy
technology and the maintenance

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,250
and the licensing that
you're paying for that

315
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,150
and replacing it with technology

316
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,040
that's more Zero Trust focus.

317
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,819
And so when you think about this

318
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
none of this stuff existed in 2017,

319
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,290
so we built it all from scratch.

320
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,680
We built the business plan,
we built a project plans.

321
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,849
I built the board deck.

322
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,407
We built the spreadsheet
of, you know, the ROI

323
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,220
and the calculations,
the budget, et cetera

324
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,760
which by the way, we will
provide that out to you all.

325
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
So you all can leverage

326
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,034
and see what we did as a part of that.

327
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,841
But, we had to build the business

328
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:42,500
the whole business plan from scratch.

329
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,270
And so that took some time.

330
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,410
And then once we built it,

331
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,579
we had to actually go
through meet with our board,

332
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,340
meet with our executive team to really not

333
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,350
sell the business plan,
but really just, you know

334
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,070
present it in a way that made it very easy

335
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,100
and a very easy decision for
us as a security company.

336
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,890
We're gonna mitigate some risk

337
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,000
as relates to our security posture.

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,220
We're gonna save the company money

339
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,310
and we're gonna, our
brand is going to be good

340
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,176
because we're going to talk
about how we did Zero Trust

341
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,160
and be the example for others to follow.

342
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,819
And so, it was a win-win across the board

343
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,453
but we had to develop it all from scratch.

344
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,209
So in Q1 of 2018 is when we
finally did the first piece

345
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,043
of implementation

346
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,827
and we really took all
the users, the roles,

347
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,010
the access rights, et cetera.

348
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,950
And we mapped them into identity

349
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,830
and access management system.

350
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,560
And so obviously I mentioned,
we use Okta for this

351
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,869
but we took all that information,
all those requirements

352
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,760
that we had implemented in Okta.

353
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,790
So that way within Okta, you
know, the users only had access

354
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,689
to the tiles slash applications
that they were supposed to

355
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,470
and nothing more.

356
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,290
And I think that's a
really critical piece to,

357
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,870
it also allowed us to actually
pull away admin rights

358
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,457
on endpoint systems.

359
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,884
That was a sort of a by-product
of the implementation

360
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:04,110
of this as we were, you
know, really had a tight

361
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,810
grip and understanding
of what the roles were,

362
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,479
what the users needed access to,

363
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,980
what rights they needed with the systems

364
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,830
and applications they needed access to

365
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,490
because we had such granular
level insight into that.

366
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,260
We're able to actually remove admin rights

367
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,050
and other things as a part
of this process as well.

368
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,569
We also did something slightly different,

369
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,510
we actually used our HRMS,

370
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,870
our HR Management System as
our single source of truth.

371
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,900
Oftentimes Active Directory
reacts in this regard

372
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,689
if it's up to me, I would
be rid of Active Directory

373
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,270
as fast as humanly possible.

374
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,449
I'm just not a big fan.

375
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,890
I understand the technology

376
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,050
and why it's important, why it's critical

377
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,829
and especially for legacy applications.

378
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,380
But, you know, I think that,
you know, identity stores

379
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,170
in the cloud with I am
providers and things

380
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,880
like that is really the
future and the way to go now.

381
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
And so we built this integration with,

382
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,739
at the time it was ADP, was our HRMS.

383
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,270
And we went with the assumption

384
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,542
that if someone was
collecting a paycheck from us,

385
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,859
they were probably an employee.

386
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,419
If they were collecting a
paycheck and not an employee

387
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,200
then we have a completely
different problem to solve.

388
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,589
But we use that as a way
to, you know, whenever

389
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,730
someone got promoted,
someone's last name changed,

390
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,050
someone moved from business
unit to business unit.

391
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,930
It would all get reflected
in our HR system first

392
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,069
and then we use that as
the trigger mechanism

393
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,980
into the identity management
solution to be able

394
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,610
to actually auto provision.

395
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,649
and deprovision those
based on what was an ADP

396
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,240
and then obviously enable
multifactor authentication

397
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,073
Single sign-on.

398
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,700
We did UEBA Integration
and Trust Inference.

399
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,320
Trust Inference is sort
of a loaded term here

400
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,820
because there is a number

401
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,399
of pieces that can help infer trust.

402
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,310
But we also wanted to create baselines

403
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,100
for our users and want
to look at behaviors.

404
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,933
We want to look at to see

405
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,415
if certain roles we're attempting access

406
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,853
to certain systems that
they weren't before.

407
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,370
Was the device approved or not?

408
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,850
So there's a number of
different sort of baselines

409
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,899
that we wanted to set up.

410
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,520
And so we can start looking
at deviations and shifts.

411
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
And deviations and shifts could mean

412
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,260
that A, could be an
attacker doing something

413
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,790
or B, it could be that the
role is actually evolving

414
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,100
and changing for that group or that unit

415
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,659
or whatever the case is

416
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,550
and that you need the
dynamic to be able to

417
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,820
adjust the policy accordingly,
to give them access rights.

418
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,939
And so there's a whole aspect around here.

419
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,760
And then obviously from
a monitoring detection

420
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,690
and response perspective, you know

421
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,030
if a user is trusted with the devices

422
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,550
and you want to be able to
automate certain actions.

423
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,780
If a device is trusted
user is that you want to

424
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,100
automate some certain actions.

425
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,699
You may force step up authentication.

426
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,200
You may have them answer
security questions or the like

427
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,330
but at the end of the day, you really,

428
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,330
the monitoring detection response
component doesn't go away.

429
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,706
The other part too is Threat
Intel is still a valid source

430
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:59,409
of the information of
indicators of compromise

431
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,700
and you know, you may be looking at, hey,

432
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,070
there's an IP address.

433
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm looking at the network aspects

434
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,800
of things relates to Zero Trust

435
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,820
that IP address shows up on a
number of Threat Intel feeds

436
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,720
isn't it various or associated
with a certain, you know

437
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
nation state threat act

438
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,230
or whatever the case might
be a ransomware variant,

439
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,230
whatever, but really you want
to be able to, you know, force

440
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,649
you know, different actions based on that.

441
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,070
You don't want to, even
if the user's trust

442
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,230
in the device is trusted.

443
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,670
If it comes in from something
that's listed predominantly on

444
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,140
a lot of threat Intel,

445
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,280
you at least want to do some validation

446
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,810
versus just allowing it in.

447
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,310
So, you know, the Threat Intel integration

448
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,800
piece is still important.

449
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,330
And I think from a results perspective,

450
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,439
when we implemented, IAM,
the UEBA, the Trust Inference

451
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,040
and establish a lot of that
obviously reduced security risk.

452
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,820
You confirm user and device behaviors.

453
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,629
So I meant by either they're a bad actor

454
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,560
or a regular employee, or
that their role is changing,

455
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,360
they need different levels of access

456
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,090
and how you can dynamically

457
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,639
actually update policies around that.

458
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,410
So it made it a bit
frictionless for our end user

459
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,850
where we didn't have to stop

460
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,464
and manually go and adjust
policies accordingly.

461
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,730
We're able to do that dynamically
based on the behaviors

462
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,180
that we were able to witness.

463
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,240
Micro-segmentation, again it's
all about giving user systems

464
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,750
and applications and data,
the appropriate access

465
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,300
to the appropriate systems,
applications, and data

466
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,560
and nothing else.

467
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,490
So I like to use the
healthcare example here where

468
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,542
you know, a doctor or a nurse or some type

469
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,060
of healthcare worker may want access

470
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,710
to a PAC system or something
that controls medical devices,

471
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,400
however, someone that works

472
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,760
in healthcare that sits
in finance or accounting

473
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,010
or whatever the case is,
probably doesn't need access

474
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,350
to the medical device systems
and medical device networks.

475
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,149
So you want to make sure that all the,

476
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,170
your network is segmented
enough from that perspective

477
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,360
to be able to say, hey look,

478
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,969
here are the clusters
systems applications of data

479
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,940
and here are the cluster of users

480
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,320
and people that enrolls
that need access to it.

481
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,877
And be able to create
perimeters around that.

482
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:09,300
And so really for us,

483
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,909
it enabled finer grain access controls

484
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,009
and then also the perimeter attributes

485
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,047
as a measure of trust.

486
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,756
And what I mean by that, is if a doctor

487
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:22,266
or a physician was logging
onto a trusted device,

488
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,090
their user was trusted, but
now they're accessing systems

489
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,100
they don't normally access,
or shouldn't be accessing,

490
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,709
which probably shouldn't be accessing

491
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,060
the finance and accounting systems,

492
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
just like the finance and accounting folks

493
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,290
shouldn't be accessing the
medical device network.

494
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,000
So we were able to use that behavior

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,653
as a measure of trust as a part of that.

496
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,940
So 2019 re-evaluation year, as I mentioned

497
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,410
at the beginning of this
talk, a lot of things changed.

498
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,073
So for us, the technology matured.

499
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,520
One thing that we did
not account for as a part

500
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,450
of our work with Zero Trust
prior to 2019 was really

501
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,450
around the custom work that
was going to be required

502
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,580
in order for us to build
the appropriate integrations

503
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,010
and have product, a talk to product B

504
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,560
in a way that we needed
them to talk to each other.

505
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,879
And so it's not something
that I had actually planned.

506
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,100
I would recommend if you're
gonna go down this path

507
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,480
to plan still some more bucket of hours

508
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,770
per time, per dollar associated with

509
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,770
some custom integrations or automations

510
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,639
or things that you may want to build out

511
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,690
that may not be there today

512
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,330
while the technology has
come a long way since 2017

513
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,610
when we started, it's still,
there are still some gaps

514
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,750
here and there as it relates
to some of these products.

515
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,590
And you know, there may still
be a need to do some of this.

516
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,944
Now the great part, is
many of these organizations

517
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,990
that own these products
have gotten together

518
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,910
and they do things with like the identity

519
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,340
to find security alliance

520
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,740
and where they have all the IAM providers

521
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,320
and privilege access management providers

522
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,179
and security companies together.

523
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,400
And they're building integrations

524
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,210
and they're building frameworks for this.

525
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,170
So that way, you know, if
someone else in the frameworks

526
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,550
around ZT, so if someone
else wants to go do this

527
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,240
and they have a multiple,
you know, commercially

528
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,247
off the shelf products
that they're leveraging

529
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:14,170
to make zero trust happen, the
integrations likely exists.

530
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,870
The automations likely exists.

531
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,399
The things that you need will likely exist

532
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,030
but I would still block out some time

533
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,593
for those one-off and unique
cases that may not exist.

534
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,060
We had new owners, we got private,

535
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,620
we got acquired by private equity.

536
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,060
And so, you know, it's
completely different

537
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,720
when you're, you know,
venture capital-backed

538
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,290
versus when you're private equity backed,

539
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,700
you know, private equity EBITDA's king

540
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,520
but I will say our private
equity firm is probably

541
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,690
the best private equity
firm I've ever been around

542
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,633
as it relates to security,
they take security seriously.

543
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,950
If I propose any changes around that

544
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,400
or any need to be able to
advance something in that space

545
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,410
it's a hundred percent
support and every time.

546
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,320
And so, we did get new owners,

547
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,970
we did get new budgets and
how to refactor all of that

548
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,230
but it really 2019 gave us, you know,

549
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,770
in addition to the changes
that were happening

550
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,080
within our business, within our company,

551
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,310
it gave us an opportunity
to reevaluate things.

552
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,919
And I think that was actually a, you know

553
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,470
something is another lessons
learned is take the time

554
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,820
and put in time slots to
reevaluate periodically

555
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,159
because this was when we
made significant changes

556
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,830
to our architecture.

557
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,050
So we implemented IAM, we
implemented a few of these things,

558
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,389
those have maintained themselves

559
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,010
across our zero trust
journey, but there are lots

560
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,990
of technologies that just
weren't capable then unless

561
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,010
you know, force fit or
Frankenstein them together.

562
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,759
But there are a lot of
them now that are actually

563
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,600
really helping you
really enable Zero Trust.

564
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,689
And so in 2019 was a pivotal
year as it relates to that.

565
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,100
And so we looked at that
and most of the technology

566
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,020
that we had thought we
were going to implement

567
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,470
as a part of our Zero Trust
model of change in 2019.

568
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,130
So it was a really good way

569
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,037
for us to reflect back
upon that, making sure that

570
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:57,150
you know, we were using
the right technology,

571
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,620
we were saving the company money

572
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,899
or maximizing that from
that perspective, you know,

573
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,100
being able to remove legacy,
you know, on-prem firewalls

574
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,980
and making sure all these
other pieces that we had baked

575
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,430
into our early plan in 2017,

576
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,380
make sure that those still held true.

577
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,950
And there may be some
consolidation that happens

578
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,090
in the technology side
where you may be able to

579
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,470
have a single platform now
doing what you originally

580
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,840
had planned multiple platforms to do

581
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,399
in order to achieve Zero Trust.

582
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,730
And so I think because of that

583
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,150
it was just a great
opportunity for us to reflect

584
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,223
and reevaluate and rearchitect
our Zero Trust model.

585
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,447
So in 2020, we started
out by implementing MDM.

586
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,310
I mentioned the couple
different products that we use

587
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,659
around that, but really we're
able to lock in on device

588
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,550
trust, being able to apply policies.

589
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,350
We peppered sort of the devices

590
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,500
with certain artifacts
that needed to be present

591
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,770
for them to be considered
one of our devices.

592
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,270
There are certificates that were done.

593
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,700
Their profiles created system stayed.

594
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,900
You know, what applications
were were were sitting on

595
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,008
the end point.

596
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:10,090
So we were able to control that, obviously

597
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,280
in addition to Patch management,

598
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,790
all the other things that we
can do as it relates to that.

599
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,909
But we were able to really
leverage the MDM side

600
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,967
in combination with what
we're implementing next

601
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,492
to be able to establish the bios trust

602
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:26,460
and you know, only allow
access for those devices

603
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,520
the resources that they need.

604
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,670
The by-product of it
also helped us clean up

605
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,030
our BYOD problem where people
were going out to Best Buy

606
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,770
and buying laptops, and
then trying to connect them

607
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,337
into our corporate network
and everything else.

608
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,830
And so, as we put this stuff
in, that got cleaned up

609
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,939
as a part of it, and so we actually,

610
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,280
we're able to solve some of
the BYOD challenges that we had

611
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,513
at our business through
this implementation.

612
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,780
PAM, we looked at that in 2021.

613
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,220
So we implemented Centrify
as a part of that.

614
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,690
They're also within our Thoma
Bravo Portfolio, but really,

615
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,070
you know, once we got all
the other pieces in place

616
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,429
we had a very small subset
of privileged accounts

617
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,790
but I think one of the
thing, and we obviously

618
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,420
wanted to control that and make
sure that those were secure

619
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,150
and only leverage whenever
the time was necessary

620
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,530
or people needed to leverage them

621
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,240
for certain reason to do their job.

622
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,210
But the other thing too

623
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,990
that I think was really
interesting is, you know,

624
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,890
we would have multiple accounts
for people to leverage based

625
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,310
on what roles they
wanted to access prior to

626
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,820
as relates to privileged
accounts or able to

627
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,820
do is to basically implement
something where a user say

628
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,510
they're an HR employee, can log in

629
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,120
as their normal HR person that
they are and do their work.

630
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,580
And when they log into
their HR management system

631
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,330
they will see their data.

632
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,310
they will see their, you know, paychecks,

633
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,270
they will see their benefits package.

634
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,290
But then whenever they need

635
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,060
to actually administer other employees

636
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,820
they can actually get
granted the rights to be able

637
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,320
to sort of step up into
that other employees,

638
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,639
into that other role
required to be able to

639
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,490
administer all the employees.

640
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,797
And so we're able to
even, you know lockdown

641
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:09,810
the sort of use of privileged accounts

642
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,409
to A, small number and B, infrequently

643
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,300
as a part of the usage

644
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,903
and being able to monitor
and track all that as well.

645
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,980
And then, In Q2 of this year,
we're making our decision

646
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,350
on the SaaS product that we'll be using to

647
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,620
do the policy brokering

648
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,989
and Access Control component
of our Zero Trust model.

649
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,470
You know, really, even though
Identity Access Management,

650
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,710
some of these other
components sort of give you

651
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,410
some more granularity

652
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,390
and fine grained controls over the users

653
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,960
and what they can access,
who can access them.

654
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,610
But there's a whole other thing, you know,

655
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,667
what can they do on the internet,

656
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,100
what SaaS systems can they access

657
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,010
et cetera, et cetera.

658
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,700
So it gives you even an additional level

659
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,410
of control as it relates
to users and devices.

660
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,810
And it also, you know

661
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,649
as I mentioned before, in combination MDM,

662
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,530
SaaS helps you actually
establish the bios trust

663
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,590
and ensure that you can
protect your systems

664
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,189
wherever they are

665
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,450
no matter what location or time of day.

666
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,440
And I think when we originally
thought CASB was gonna

667
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,780
be the rock, because
that was the only thing

668
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,570
that could potentially fit
into this role, you know,

669
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,590
the great part is with
the SaaS implementations

670
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,760
you get CASB, you get DLP,
you get additional security

671
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,780
productions and so we removed, you know,

672
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,300
99% of our firewalls.

673
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,730
We ended up having to maintain
one small firewall just

674
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,340
because there were a few
things that we still host

675
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,639
in a Data Center that we had
to protect, but we were able to

676
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,890
get rid of all the rest of our
physical firewall appliances

677
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,325
or VPN all of the maintenance,

678
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:44,120
all the costs associated with them.

679
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,760
We actually leverage that to
actually purchase our SaaS

680
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,410
solution that we decided
to go forward with.

681
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,070
So with that being said,

682
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,899
it's a big thing and will
be done in Q2 of this year.

683
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,830
And once we complete
this aspect of things,

684
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,842
we will be a complete with
our Zero Trust journey.

685
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,362
So looking back,

686
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,300
Lot of slowdowns, as you can
tell, it took us four years.

687
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
You know, it's one thing
to be the perfect sort

688
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,260
of organization that's fit for this.

689
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,870
And other thing to take four years.

690
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,649
So maybe it wasn't as perfect
as we originally thought

691
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,100
but budgetary constraints,
changes in our business,

692
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,179
the maturing of technology,
being able to truly let go

693
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,260
of some legacy technology
is a part of it too.

694
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,990
So that was sort of a
battle with, I wouldn't say

695
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,000
with our IT organization
to they're fantastic

696
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,500
and we're amazing partners
with each other, but you know,

697
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,226
people that were used to
firewalls being firewalls,

698
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:46,550
that you physically have on
your perimeter and doing this

699
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,120
and being able to help
them sort of break away

700
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,739
from that old model of thinking
was also part of it as well.

701
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,060
But the business changes, you know,

702
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,270
we had to develop all the ZT
sort of business components.

703
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,913
There was all this, you
know, you could read the

704
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:02,930
O'Reilly book on Zero Trust.

705
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,190
You can read all the white
papers you've learned

706
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,740
about what it is, but then when it's okay

707
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,980
I understand what it is
now, how do I go do it?

708
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,250
And I think that's the part
that's still even today,

709
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,380
a gap in our environment.

710
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,107
We've given use cases about
how to do certain thing

711
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,060
and you give them certain materials

712
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,220
out that may help facilitate some of that.

713
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,820
But the business models,
the project plans,

714
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,840
the status updates, the board decks,

715
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,659
all the stuff around the business

716
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,810
of ZT had to be developed from scratch.

717
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,720
And that took some time.

718
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,490
And so hopefully we'll
save you time by providing

719
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,640
those materials to you at
the end of this presentation.

720
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,830
And then the indirect costs.

721
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,139
I mentioned the custom
integrations and automations,

722
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,470
the workflow and processes
associated with that.

723
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,550
And so there were some indirect costs

724
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:48,763
that we didn't account for as
a part of our implementation.

725
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,110
But we use 2019 to rearchitect.

726
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,209
We moved off of the legacy technology.

727
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,320
We started realizing
some of the cost savings.

728
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,810
We started realizing some
of the process efficiencies

729
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,510
which I think can't be
understated is process efficiency

730
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,680
is a huge thing in the
private equity world.

731
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,990
They want you to be lean,
mean, and they want you to

732
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,812
have these refined processes
that really maximize your

733
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,149
you know, your ability to be successful.

734
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,629
And, you know, there is a lot

735
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,959
of process optimization that happens

736
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,160
as a part of a ZT implementation.

737
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,280
And you have to factor
that into the budget.

738
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,680
I mean, that is a key component.

739
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,100
If I can reduce IT help desk
take a load by 50% as a part of

740
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,699
my Zero Trust implementation.

741
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,388
Well, maybe that's 50% less
that they need on certain things

742
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:38,159
or they can reallocate
those into other areas

743
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,623
of the business, but that
has to be factored in.

744
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,110
And then obviously we wanted to change

745
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,310
along with our business.

746
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,230
One of the benefits obviously
is, it's not listed on here

747
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,760
but really is the COVID benefit.

748
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,730
Whenever the pandemic had
force our workforce remote,

749
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,710
we really didn't have a hiccup
in our operation whatsoever

750
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,430
because we were already
down this Zero Trust path

751
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,800
when it happened, we were
able to quickly pivot

752
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,610
and really didn't have
any issues associated

753
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,159
with that while other
companies and friends of mine

754
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,420
and other CSOs were
scrambling to be able to pivot

755
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,450
into the new remote workforce.

756
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,340
I mentioned operational efficiency gains,

757
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,629
we actually achieved some of those.

758
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,580
I didn't even think that were, you know,

759
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,629
I didn't anticipate
achieving whenever we first

760
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,430
started the journey.

761
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,950
One of them being the
decrease IT ticket workload

762
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,280
by doing the auto provisioning

763
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,513
and deprovisioning, et
cetera, move at changes.

764
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:39,659
The recoup costs of, you
know, subsidizing basically

765
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,770
your legacy technology
with your ZT technology

766
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,657
whenever all boils down, you know,

767
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:48,510
the firewall components that
great example will end up

768
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,650
being more secure will
end up being when we go

769
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,020
to the SaaS model, we'll end up being

770
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,810
have more visibility, more
access, everything that we need

771
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,220
to be able to implement
Zero Trust effectively.

772
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,750
It'll actually come at a
cost savings in comparison

773
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,350
to the maintenance and operating
expense that we are paying

774
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,840
for our on-prem perimeter firewalls

775
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,679
that we had in our environment.

776
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,770
And so just that alone, you know, for us,

777
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,710
as a 30 to 40% cost savings
that we realized even more

778
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,510
than what we originally anticipated.

779
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,440
So obviously there's security benefits

780
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,100
but I think the main thing
I wanted to really stress

781
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,339
is that, it's more than just security.

782
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,650
There's operational benefits,
there's IT benefits,

783
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,850
there's a number of benefits around it

784
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,639
in addition to just security.

785
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,969
And I think there's lots
of benefits to the business

786
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,429
that us as CSOs onto a
great job of presenting,

787
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,319
but there are more than
just security benefits

788
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,743
as relates to the
implementation of Zero Trust.

789
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,630
So I think some lessons
learned real quick.

790
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,449
You don't have to implement
Zero Trust all at once.

791
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,409
It took us four years,
but we reaped the benefits

792
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,879
along the way as a part of
that implementation journey.

793
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,280
Rearchitecturing is
okay, technology evolves,

794
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
technology matures in these areas

795
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,250
and now everything is aligned

796
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,870
or has alignment to Zero
Trust or enables Zero Trust.

797
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,520
And so, you know, you
will likely rearchitect

798
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,790
as a part of your implementation

799
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,210
and make ZT a business risk
and make it a business problem

800
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,370
and make it a business enabler.

801
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,520
And so being able to show

802
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,040
that you're actually making more money

803
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,120
or reducing risk or minimizing
costs associated with it

804
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,839
is a by-product that is important

805
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,390
for you to stress at the board
level or at the exact level.

806
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,379
It's not just about security,
risk and technology.

807
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,630
And then cultural alignment,
and then budget ahead of time

808
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,600
for unknown costs, which is
something that we should've

809
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,779
dealt a little bit better of as well.

810
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,050
So your action plan within the
next week, like I mentioned

811
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,910
throughout the presentation,
we'll be providing you access

812
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,879
to all of our materials
that we had to leverage

813
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,830
in order to implement our Zero Trust plan,

814
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,509
the board decks, the project plans,

815
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,980
the budgets and the
financial models, et cetera.

816
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,620
Leverage that develop
your roadmap, strategy

817
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,330
and architecture, follow
the same, you know,

818
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,680
conduct your impact assessment,

819
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,359
identify your toxic data sources.

820
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,400
You can follow a lot of
the same paths that we did,

821
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,920
a lot of the same
activities that we went on

822
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,160
to be able to do that.

823
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,850
Develop your business plan, present it,

824
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,819
get approval hopefully
and then you're well

825
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,460
on your way to implementing and executing.

826
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,150
And I think, you know, ideally
if you have a lot of these

827
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,350
components or we can arm
you with the right materials

828
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,400
that you can leverage to
do this stuff quickly.

829
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
You know, you could realize your trust

830
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,640
in six months to a year.

831
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,620
So with that, I want to
say thank you very much

832
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,799
for listening to my presentation
on our Zero Trust journey.

833
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,740
Hopefully you found some value in that.

834
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,879
Feel free to reach out to
me at any point in time.

835
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,300
I happened to share
any of the nitty gritty

836
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,750
relates to the good, bad and the ugly

837
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,250
of our Zero Trust implementation
that wasn't shared today.

838
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,610
But overall, hopefully enjoy
your rest your conference.

839
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,793
And thank you again.
