1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,253
- Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,470
Thank you for joining our session

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,490
in RSA conference Gets
Rich or Get Hunted Trying,

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,950
I'm uncovering Large
Scale Fraud Operations.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,350
My name is Tom Dorsen

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,800
and I managing the
Cybersecurity Research Lab

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,283
group Trusteer Labs, IBM Security.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
Here with me today is Donna Paluch.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,590
She's heading our web research
group in Trusteer Labs.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,700
And today we're gonna
show you a few examples

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,500
of interesting attacks
that our lab covered.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,910
So I'll hand off to Donna to
begin with the conversation

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,599
and I'll meet you guys later during it.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,433
- Thank you dor.

15
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,340
So thank you everyone for joining us.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,510
A short introduction to what
we're going to see today.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,839
So first of all we're going to talk

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,813
about the recent changes
in the digital world

19
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,730
that we're seeing.

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,610
Later on, we're going to
touch the COVID pandemic

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,680
and how it affected the
threat landscape trends.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,190
And then we'll present the tech overviews

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,080
that are very interesting,
that we've analyzed

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,730
and dissected in our research lab

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,970
and of course countermeasures
how to address these threats.

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,210
So I'll start with the
digital transformation.

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,890
This is something that is
going on for a while now

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,860
and it keeps being
enhanced and accelerated.

29
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,750
And of course with the COVID-19 pandemic,

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,270
people are starting working from home

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,600
and this is increasing the amount

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
of users logging in to different platforms

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,390
and organizations as well.

34
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,163
So of course this actually
leads to new targets.

35
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,500
Many new victims, potential
victims are out there

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,130
and they can be targeted

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,933
and lured into a unique attacks

38
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,733
that we're going to share with you.

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,820
The unmanaged corporate
devices being used,

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,860
the bring your own device model

41
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,860
is being used in this
very recent pandemic.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,140
So people are actually
using their private devices

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,130
to logging to organizational
platforms and whatnot.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,240
And this is very dangerous
since they do not have

45
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:19,020
the organization's policy and
the security measures such

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,990
as antiviruses and
firewall and all of that.

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,780
And we're also seeing the
attacks magnitude is on the rise.

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,240
Again, since we have a lot

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,930
of new targets not just the end users

50
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,130
that are logging in, but also a lot

51
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,570
of companies and organizations

52
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,799
that are now having a new online platforms

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,100
to serve their users

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,640
or customers during the quarantine

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,989
and giving them alternative
ways to communicate.

56
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,080
Also, we're seeing some
changes in the attacks tactics,

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,670
techniques, and procedures

58
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,019
and this is something that
we're going to share with you

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,413
and it's very exciting.

60
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,420
So of course we see a
lot of things in our lab.

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,420
We analyze threads from the
web and mobile channels.

62
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,003
Also everything that
is social engineering,

63
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,990
these are things that we are looking into.

64
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,000
And today we're going to focus on main

65
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,410
very large scale attacks
in the phishing field

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,090
and in the immobile emulator fields.

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,410
So I'm going to start

68
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,813
with the phishing field
and it's very interesting.

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,839
So phishing is a very old threat.

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,280
We thought it would go away.

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not going anywhere.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,680
It's constantly, it keeps improving

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,870
and getting more and more sophisticated.

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,023
So we're seeing growth
in top level domains.

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,190
This will, provide the expedite

76
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,710
of new domain registration

77
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,670
and provide a lot of ways to
basically lure more victims

78
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,880
into falling for the attacks.

79
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,180
Another thing that we're seeing
is using SSL certificates.

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,730
So once way back you used
to tell your relatives,

81
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,829
hey, look for the padlock in the certain,

82
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,410
the URL address search bar

83
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,520
and this will indicate that
your connection is secure.

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,060
This is no longer the case.

85
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,700
A lot of phishing attacks are
using SSL certificate as well.

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,039
And another thing that is very,

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,360
we're very familiar with

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
and it keeps rising is using
session randomization folders.

89
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
So in this way, the actors
are creating unique URLs.

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,820
This can go up to thousands

91
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,340
of unique URLs for just one attack.

92
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,880
So for each end user browsing to decide,

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,620
you can see a new folder
that is being generated

94
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,680
and creating a new unique URL.

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,920
And of course, Man-in-the-middle attacks

96
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,500
if we're going to drill down into.

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
So first of all, COVID-19

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,210
we've seen some new delivery
methods in this case

99
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,219
some fishing and malware delivery emails.

100
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,810
So we're seeing some fake white
house instructions are sent

101
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,990
from the presidents.

102
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,580
Of course, this is not the case.

103
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,419
It's completely fake.

104
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,370
They're trying to use scared
people that are very worried

105
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,470
for their financial status
and of course their health.

106
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,330
And they're talking

107
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,380
about groundbreaking steps to
slow the spread of the virus.

108
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,913
Also some IRS tax adjustments, of course

109
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,440
this is completely fake

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,393
and delivers the attacks.

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,530
Moving forward, I'm going to discuss

112
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,700
some really cool anti research technique

113
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,930
we've seen in our lab.

114
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,410
So a lot of actors are trying
to bypass security measures

115
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,580
and vendors.

116
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,030
And so in this case, for example,

117
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,500
the actor is trying to take
a look at the geolocation

118
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,780
of the end user, trying
to browse to the attack.

119
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,940
So for example, these
attack targeted the UK then.

120
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,280
And as you can see below the actor

121
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,570
is trying to see where is
the user browsing from?

122
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,570
And if the IP is located
out of the UK, the victim

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,359
or potential victim will actually reach

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,850
to a 404 not found page,
meaning he will be blocked

125
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,010
and will not be able to
browse to the phishing site.

126
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,240
And this way the actor
is eliminating unrelevant

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,210
or unreal credentials from reaching

128
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,729
to his CNC command line.

129
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,130
And moving forward to additional ways

130
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,730
that the actors are using.

131
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,090
So for example, in the
session protection part,

132
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,960
there is a snippet that
actually is indicating

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,229
where did the end-user
reach to the phishing pages.

134
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,410
So if I'm just a regular victim,

135
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,410
I will go through the
main flow of the attack.

136
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,390
For example, I will start
with the login page,

137
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,750
enter my credentials, be
redirected to, moving forward

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,960
to the second page of
the attack and so on.

139
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,780
So in many times security vendors

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,650
can get the access directly
to different stages

141
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,460
or different pages of the attack.

142
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,130
And this is something that is,

143
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,170
of course not a regular victim will do.

144
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,220
So the actor is blocking them
out of reaching these pages

145
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,670
and just present them the Google page.

146
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,640
So they won't be able to
analyze and take down his site.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,409
And another thing that he
can detect is a proxy usage.

148
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,780
For example, if we talked
about geolocation detection

149
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,210
then in this case, a lot

150
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,219
of security vendors will
hide their IP address

151
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,230
whether it's to protect their own identity

152
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,220
or to bypass the geolocation protection.

153
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,050
So the actor is looking
for, are you using a proxy

154
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,430
related IP address using
a third-party service?

155
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,940
And in case you are,

156
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,030
you will also be blocked from
reaching to the phishing site.

157
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,320
So these are just a few
parts that your seeing.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,865
And of course the actor
has a blocked IP list

159
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:11,510
of ranges list and for
each and every visitor

160
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,510
that he will get to his phishing site,

161
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,010
he will compare the IP address
to his blacklisted IPS.

162
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,010
And in case these are
not in the blacklist,

163
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,030
then these addresses we will log in

164
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,619
to the accepted visitors list.

165
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,820
And he will be able to
tell these are victims

166
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,419
that are relevant to him.

167
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,439
In case these visitors

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,620
are in the block list IP address,

169
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,600
then they will be logged in
to the denied visitor list.

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,410
And of course, will not be able

171
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,300
to access the phishing page.

172
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,699
So they will also be redirected to Google.

173
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,330
And in this way, he is
blocking for example,

174
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,840
the ranges of security
companies and research entities

175
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,960
so he can know that in advance.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,620
So these are just a few of
the methods that we've seen.

177
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,590
And what I'm going to show you now

178
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,080
is a very very cool
Man-in-the-Middle reverse proxy

179
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,310
phishing attack.

180
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,099
So if you are familiar

181
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,650
with regular phishing
attacks, you probably know

182
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,622
and if you don't, I'm going
to share that with you

183
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,630
that once the user enters his credentials

184
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,150
to a phishing site, he's
actually being redirected,

185
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,800
once the attack is over,
he's been redirected

186
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,459
to the legitimate site
of the targeted brand.

187
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,220
So because he is not
entering his credentials

188
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,190
to a real site, he will not
be able to reach his account,

189
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,023
of course.

190
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:44,190
So the credentials will
be forwarded to the actor

191
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,530
and that will be all.

192
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,839
But in this really cool
technique, this is not the case.

193
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,960
What actually happens
is the actor is using a

194
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,990
reverse proxy server.

195
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,130
And in this way, he can
reflect to the end user,

196
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,700
to the victim, the legitimate site

197
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,180
and doing that and showing the end user

198
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,890
that he's on the fish, I'm sorry,

199
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,569
on his legitimate account

200
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,720
while actually being on a phishing site.

201
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,140
So he'll will not be able to see that.

202
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,350
And this is being done

203
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,980
for hijacking the entire
session of the victim.

204
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,120
So I'm going to show you

205
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,690
what we were able to
reconstruct in our lab.

206
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,590
A really cool to using Evilginx server

207
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,260
but Evilginx is just one way to do it.

208
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,460
There are a lot of other
projects out there.

209
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,340
So in this case, we're
actually in the role

210
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,970
of the actor where actually
loading our project,

211
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,230
which is the Evilginx

212
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,540
And we have purchased cloud service server

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,400
and domain that will host this attack.

214
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,400
So in this case, we're enabling
the the phishing attack

215
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,640
that will target in this case,

216
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
the very unfamiliar
platform named Instagram.

217
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,040
So what you can see here
is how we get the full URL

218
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,360
of the attack using the
domain that we've purchased.

219
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,620
This is the full URL.

220
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,470
And now let's take a look on the end user

221
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,480
on the victims end.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,420
So he's browsing to the phishing site,

223
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,069
what he sees is the legitimate, I'm sorry,

224
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,980
the fake sites, the login page,
you can see his credentials.

225
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,910
And what I wanted to show you here is keep

226
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,160
in mind this password,

227
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,839
the legitimate one starts
with the digit one.

228
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,330
This is important for what I'm
going to show you later on.

229
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,330
So the end user just logged
in and he's in his account.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,589
You can see the feed,

231
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,090
you can see the profile of the victim.

232
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,870
So this is very unique
because as you can see

233
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,200
in the address bar,

234
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,900
this victim is actually on phishing site

235
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,150
but he can see his legitimate account.

236
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,150
So this is how the server
reflects the legitimate account.

237
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,100
And in green here below
you can see the credentials

238
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,940
that the server has captured.

239
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,270
So you can see an email address

240
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,340
and you can see the password.

241
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,610
Again, it starts with the digit one.

242
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,070
And now with using the session command

243
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,070
we can see some more information

244
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,270
and the remote IP that is being used.

245
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,860
And by choosing the exact idea

246
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,310
of the session, we can see
some real down information

247
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,270
and session tokens

248
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,810
that will actually allow the actor

249
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,594
to conduct a full session hijacking.

250
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:41,595
So in this case, the session
ID token is being used

251
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,720
you can see that you're using some kind

252
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,890
of a cookie editor to conduct that.

253
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,006
So we're actually trying to connect

254
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:53,920
to the legitimate end user

255
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:57,963
or the victims session
that is currently live.

256
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,730
But what you can see on the address bar is

257
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,360
that we're on the Instagram site, okay?

258
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,000
So we are now on the
legitimate site trying

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to use the stolen credentials
and stolen cookies

260
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,660
and actually hijack the
end users entire session.

261
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,280
So refreshing the legitimate site using

262
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,439
these stolen tokens

263
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:32,607
and we're going to be directly
in the user's account.

264
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,320
You can see this is the victim's account.

265
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,870
You can see his feed

266
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,132
and you can see that we're
on the legitimate site.

267
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,392
So we are now in the online session

268
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,050
that is happening, but we've entered

269
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,699
that without the stolen credentials
or user password, right?

270
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,600
So I'm going to show you what we,

271
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,380
why we need them for.

272
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,850
So in this case,

273
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,140
what we're able to do is
actually change the password

274
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,110
to complete the full ATO of our attack.

275
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,003
So we will use the all password

276
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:08,790
that we just captured and
we'll create a new one.

277
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,481
So this will allow us to be able to log in

278
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:16,320
to this account on the legitimate site

279
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,230
and we'll actually block
this user from doing

280
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,060
that on his end.

281
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,969
So as you can see, the
password is changed.

282
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,890
You can see below the alert

283
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,819
and logging on from
these legitimate account.

284
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,100
And in this case, we are the actor.

285
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,100
So we logged on after
changing the password.

286
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,793
Now we're going to use our password

287
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,612
that we've created and
the victim is not aware of

288
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:45,180
and you can see it starts
with the digit two, right?

289
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,010
The first one started with the digit one.

290
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,689
And there you have it.

291
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,800
We changed the password,

292
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,640
we're to log in and the
user is actually locked out

293
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,473
of his account.

294
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,240
And this is just a personal user.

295
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,030
Imagine what can be done
to business accounts.

296
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,230
How can this be monetized?

297
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,400
And so this is something

298
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,560
that is very very interesting and unique

299
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,560
and we were very happy to
analyze and investigate here.

300
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,577
So what we see also is different types

301
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:23,140
of kits that are using this method.

302
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,460
So in another case, we've seen,

303
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,050
for example, a global financial Institute

304
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,510
that was being targeted
all around the world.

305
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,780
So in this case, even the
delivery method was unique

306
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,260
because the actor used
a unique token for each

307
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,150
and every email that he sent,
of course automatically.

308
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,050
And if you were not using that URL,

309
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,630
the unique URL or you were not able

310
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,850
to browse to the phishing site.

311
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,650
So it's not only that it's
also the legitimate, I'm sorry,

312
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,410
the phishing attack, the
phishing URL is also using

313
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,650
know characters to resemble
as much as possible

314
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,860
to the legitimate site,
with special characters.

315
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,390
And once the user was
on the phishing site,

316
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,287
he was actually trying to
change his OTP settings.

317
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,510
So in the email that the fraudster sent,

318
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,480
he was asking victims to change or update

319
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,070
or make sure their
mobile number is updated

320
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,030
in the account for two FA purposes.

321
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,670
So in this case, what the
victim was doing is trying

322
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,010
to update his number.

323
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,530
But since the actor was
hijacking his session,

324
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,949
he was able to enter
his own device number,

325
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,340
his own mobile number

326
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,220
and this way bypassing to FA methods

327
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,900
and now he has both his
credentials, user password

328
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,630
and the mobile device is his own.

329
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,670
So he can log into that
account, get the OTP password

330
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,949
to his device and complete the full ATO.

331
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,350
So this is just one way to do it.

332
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,430
It's very interesting.

333
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,479
There are a lot of methods

334
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,910
and I'm going to hand off to Dor to talk

335
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,703
about the large scale
mobile emulator frauds.

336
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,060
- Thank you, Donna, for
the phishing session.

337
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,490
And now we're gonna
discuss another interesting

338
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,950
massive account takeover

339
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,040
that we have discovered recent here,

340
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,970
which was the wrong mobile emulators form.

341
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,800
So what is mobile emulator?

342
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Mobile emulator is basically a software

343
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,210
that's installed in desktop devices

344
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,780
in order to mimic a mobile devices.

345
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,870
Or you can pick different devices

346
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,310
with different features

347
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,080
and how you want them to be act like.

348
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,439
And what fraudsters did is

349
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,020
they actually took you,

350
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,650
they utilize this into a massive
form of account takeovers.

351
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,790
So think of these attacks
like Donna explained

352
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,970
or phishing attack for example.

353
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,340
So due to COVID situation,

354
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,310
there were massive attacks
of phishing that we've seen.

355
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,330
And the fact that there are a lot

356
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,110
of credentials being stole,

357
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,830
how did the fraudsters to be act smartly

358
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,860
and do a mass operation

359
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,219
and where they're using a method

360
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,750
of account takeover to
do this verification

361
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,860
and then on transactions, of course,

362
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,120
from the accounts they took over from of.

363
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,149
So think of just an example
of phishing attacks.

364
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,560
As you can see in that slide there,

365
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,740
plenty other opportunities

366
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,820
for threat actors to put
their hands on credential,

367
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,870
whether it's from malware attacks,

368
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,189
that's also grew in the recent year due

369
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,490
to the COVID pandemic and
whether it's from a lot

370
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,030
of data leaks that people

371
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,220
that lost their credentials
in different leaks

372
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,220
and they will end up on the Darknet.

373
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,960
So what the fraudsters a group did

374
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,830
as they took all these stolen credentials,

375
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,800
alongside with other indicators

376
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,950
from these compromised sessions

377
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,650
so they can be able to spoof

378
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,810
and they look like they're logging

379
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,020
from their own device.

380
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,490
From the original victim's device.

381
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,730
They actually store them
on a command control server

382
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,990
and then they started a mass operation

383
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,230
when they do several actions.

384
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,520
So what I'm gonna do in
the following slides,

385
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,062
I'm gonna walk you through,

386
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,389
of one these forms that
we have actually detected

387
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,100
and how they operated it.

388
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,100
So in the first stage, what
we have discovered is like

389
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,310
from two different actors, actually how

390
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,040
they do device fingerprints spoofing.

391
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,620
So as I said, it's not enough today,

392
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,429
just to steal your password and username.

393
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,913
Of course, a lot of other
mechanisms, such as,

394
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,610
a multifactor authentication
that prevent you

395
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,840
from logging in once they detecting

396
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,389
you're not coming from your own device.

397
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,720
So actors of course started
it and they know that.

398
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
And therefore in one of the operations

399
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,840
that we have uncovered,

400
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,320
they used this following
software you see in the slide

401
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,980
in order to conduct the actual change

402
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,920
of features in the device

403
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,040
and it will look like it's
from the victim's device.

404
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,180
Such as the device model,
device country, operator, etc.

405
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,620
In another case we uncovered, the actors

406
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,199
were actually were
developing their own code,

407
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,490
their own software within the emulator

408
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,100
to conduct this perfect spoofing.

409
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,980
So there were a lot of features here

410
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,150
that you can see in this code snippet

411
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,810
that we have taken from one

412
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,429
of the applications that we have gathered

413
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,930
which is of cause also

414
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,120
CPU, ID, manufacturer model, etcetera.

415
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,219
So in order to conduct
this perfect spoofing,

416
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,820
you must be able to change
the device attributes

417
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,939
and features.

418
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,550
So this is just one example

419
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,530
from our internal case that

420
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,379
when one emulator created about 8,000,

421
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,510
more than 8,000 cases
of compromised sessions.

422
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,410
So you can see the different model

423
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,610
of Android actually devices

424
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,270
that's where uncovered in this case.

425
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,103
And he's just not done.

426
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,650
Here you can see a lot
of other aspects here

427
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,180
from device build fingerprinting,

428
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,100
to device build board product,
builds model, et cetera.

429
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,219
So it just to give you the sense of idea

430
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,710
of how from just one
emulator attack, the amount

431
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,743
of sessions that were actually
compromised in this attack.

432
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,400
The other thing that these
actors were doing is they,

433
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
of course want to change
the network connection

434
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,150
of the sessions the original
victims are coming from.

435
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,330
So there were a lot of
options of how they did this.

436
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,550
So from actually implementing
a Socks proxy application

437
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,550
that's terminate the
regional victims network

438
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,959
into the actual fraudsters server.

439
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,340
So it could be seen like the Proctor

440
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,250
has the IP address of the original user.

441
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,810
And this is like

442
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,750
for the advanced cases, of course.

443
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,730
In other cases, the fraudsters
could just implement

444
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,990
their own VPN connection from the device,

445
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,040
whether if it's from open
source VPN applications

446
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,060
to just known accounts
like the ones you see

447
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,230
and the fraudsters can just pick one

448
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,720
from the play store, from
the Android play store

449
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,010
and just install them on their server.

450
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,280
So, so far the fraudsters are making all

451
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,290
these automation in doing
this device spoofing,

452
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,600
fingerprinting spoofing and Geolocation.

453
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,100
What we have see more is
in that same application

454
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,939
that we have uncovered, the
actors also created hooping

455
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,170
on the targeted applications
that they were targeting.

456
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,530
And of course in order to conduct

457
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,160
their account takeover phase

458
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,960
and they're actually listening

459
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,070
to the entire network screen

460
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,580
that get out of these sessions.

461
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,300
So they can understand and be able

462
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,159
to debug some of these sessions

463
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,180
and also to understand
if something happened

464
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,200
in the sessions that need to be modified

465
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,690
in order to conduct a successful IPO.

466
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,380
So they also have this phase

467
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,380
when they're just looking at
the network traffic coming

468
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,090
and getting out from their server?

469
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,070
So now you're asking yourself, okay,

470
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,950
how all of these orchestration is working.

471
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,800
So all of these things
are all tied in scripts

472
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,810
that were crafted for the mission

473
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,600
of conducting these
perfect account takeover

474
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,740
in a mass scale.

475
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,137
So just think of all the
credentials that were taken,

476
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:47,015
whether it's from phishing
attacks, malware attacks,

477
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:50,870
Darknet, compromised
credentials over the Darknet.

478
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,909
And they were all got into this automation

479
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,550
where scripts are just going

480
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,610
into the original application
of the original provider

481
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,409
of the victims and just
typing the credentials,

482
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,220
log-in credentials,
password, the username.

483
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,730
But now you're asking yourself, okay,

484
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,170
so what about the second
factor authentication

485
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,407
or any other source of one time password

486
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:19,112
that these original
providers are actually using?

487
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,649
So there are a lot of ways
that the actors can do.

488
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,060
So one of the ways is
just sending an automated

489
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,070
smishing attack to the
victim once they have their

490
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,970
of course, compromised credential.

491
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,460
With these credentials, sometimes they

492
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,330
have other data such as
the victim's phone number,

493
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,210
of course.

494
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,930
So they can send him an SMS with some kind

495
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,310
of a social engineering asking
him to type the password

496
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,143
or the one time password

497
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,090
that he just got on his device

498
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,120
for some kind of a good reason.

499
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,090
And guess what, a lot of
people are falling into

500
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,139
that then just giving their number,

501
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,510
giving the OTP number into

502
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,270
that smishing attack.

503
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,300
By that the OTB number is being set

504
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,210
to their remote server

505
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,210
and from that part, the
account take over completed

506
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,330
at this point.

507
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,629
There are other ways actors
can install a malware

508
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,350
that knows how do I check
the one-time password.

509
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,000
This is of course the classic case,

510
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,313
which is like, you know,

511
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,950
fraudsters have been
doing for a long time.

512
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,940
But in this part of automation,

513
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,050
this could also being automated as part

514
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,659
of the victims were infected by malware.

515
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,430
And last one are also could be

516
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,880
with robotic vishing call

517
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,729
where the actual victim getting a call

518
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,580
from some kind of a call center

519
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,530
that they identified to
be the original provider

520
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,379
and some kind of a robotic call asking

521
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,750
from the user to type
the one-time password

522
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,563
he just got to his device, in order to,

523
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:56,090
for some good reason.

524
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,715
To unlock his account, to
continue some operations

525
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:03,070
and some social engineering scam.

526
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,810
So a lot of people are falling into that

527
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,440
by that they're ensuring

528
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,510
that the second factor authentication

529
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,440
will be bypassed later on

530
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,523
which brings to transfer of funds.

531
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,793
But not everything is bad as it may seem.

532
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:23,090
So far we showed you these,

533
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,689
let's put it this way, dangerous attacks,

534
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,480
both on automation of account takeover

535
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,690
and both on the phishing work

536
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,690
that sort of became
sophisticated in 2020 and 2021.

537
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,370
And we believe they're gonna
get more within the years.

538
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,806
So in order to do tackle the mass attacks

539
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,870
that we're seeing these days,

540
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,100
we need to use AI.

541
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,939
So what's an AI, okay?

542
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,090
Of course Artificial Intelligence,
but how it works like?

543
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,740
So in order to briefly
explain the methods.

544
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,140
So think of that you want
to learn your machine

545
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,830
to recognize something, for
example, in this case apples.

546
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,840
So yeah, Apple, you know,
they're in this example,

547
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,810
they're red, they're kind of rounded.

548
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,363
They have a green leaf.

549
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:16,500
And we learned the model, the machine.

550
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,040
Okay. So look, these are apples.

551
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,020
These don't look like apples, okay?

552
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,820
These are their features
and these are their color.

553
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,240
And then we provided the
machine with an Apple

554
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,440
and we ask the machine, what's that?

555
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,020
And then the machine responding with,

556
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,060
yeah, that's an Apple

557
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,310
because now I studied it features,

558
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,290
I know how it's being constructed

559
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,320
and now I know how to detect it.

560
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,929
So the same we do for cybersecurity.

561
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,320
So for example, what we did in what group,

562
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,812
what organizations are doing these days,

563
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:50,310
are actually using AI to combat threats.

564
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,399
So for phishing, for
example, so you can see

565
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,950
in the upper images, you
can see on the left side

566
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,050
this is a compromised website

567
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,120
that was uploaded a phishing site into it

568
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,730
of a massive retail provider.

569
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,280
On the right side, you can see just

570
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,220
the original compromise domain.

571
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,900
So you can understand that the look

572
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,540
and feel of these two websites
are completely different

573
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,060
although they're hosted
on the same landing page.

574
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,320
So what does it mean?

575
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,320
It means that they have many
features in their internals

576
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,429
of HTML source code, JavaScript code

577
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,430
and a lot of other CSS
code, the style and whatnot.

578
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,080
A couple of these two both
websites on the same domain

579
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,669
that they are being constructed from.

580
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,690
So think of that.

581
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,050
I mean, that's one idea of
how machine can differentiate

582
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,250
between the two.

583
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,950
And on the bottom line,
you can see, for example,

584
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,380
the organization representing

585
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,920
which is gonna wanna give you an example

586
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,580
of the logo detection.

587
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,110
So how logo detection helping
with commenting phishing?

588
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,340
So there are a lot of websites

589
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,319
which, let's put it this way,

590
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,120
many scanner won't help you these days.

591
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,000
They're doing the maximum effort,

592
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
Product was doing the maximum effort

593
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,969
to make sure their code
is pretty much minimized

594
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,360
without any sense of
understanding in relations

595
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,479
to the targeted organization.

596
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,690
So what you've left is the best phishing

597
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,330
which it must be constructed

598
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,280
from the original
targeted logo, of course,

599
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,940
and look and feel of the targeted brand.

600
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,080
So one of the things

601
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,280
that Artificial Intelligence
could be used to

602
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,800
as one of the features

603
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,550
of the entire machine learning process

604
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,530
is using a logo based image detection.

605
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,189
So these are just a quick example

606
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:57,189
of how you can leverage
AI to combat phishing.

607
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,543
So with that said,

608
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,410
what you need to do, okay?

609
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,230
What you need to do in the upcoming weeks.

610
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,130
So, first of all you must look,

611
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,990
for your organization,
for blind spots, okay?

612
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,930
You must understand,

613
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,120
whether you have the best
security processes in place.

614
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,919
You must understand,

615
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,353
do you have derived security processes

616
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,870
and tools in place in order
to combat attacks like

617
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,090
we've seen today and more?

618
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,050
What else do you need to
do in the upcoming weeks

619
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,879
after, is you need to find and think

620
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,510
of the best strategy after
you've detected these gaps,

621
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,010
these blind spots

622
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,520
and whether do you have
the right tools in place?

623
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,190
And you need to think of
how and what tools do I use

624
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,470
that gives me the best and less friction,

625
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,980
of course, by the lowest cost.

626
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,900
And this is the things that
are pretty much obvious

627
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,280
to every organization these days.

628
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,010
And later on, what you have to do is

629
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,650
of course, is if you understand

630
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,580
that what you need to
do in if organization

631
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,800
is facing tremendous
effects from versatile...

632
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,139
Let's put it this way, versatile attacks,

633
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,140
whether it's from, web,
malware, phishing and whatnot.

634
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,360
You must understand if you're
experiencing a mass scale

635
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,260
of attacks and therefore you need to think

636
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,543
of an AI based solution.

637
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,440
But I must add

638
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,410
that AI solutions are
not enough by their own.

639
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,110
Of course, the AI will
always be accommodate

640
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,879
with some lower percentage, of course,

641
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
in the best tools of false-positive.

642
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,649
So in order to make sure you have

643
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,400
the best security measures
in place, you also must know

644
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,030
that you must choose the
right tool to be integrated

645
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,420
with heuristic and rules rules in place

646
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,110
that will come in conjunction
with an AI solution.

647
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,659
And of course you must continue

648
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,170
to assess the threat landscape

649
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,400
that your organization is facing.

650
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,400
So I hope you have learned
a lot of new stuff today

651
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,580
and you'll make use of the advice

652
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,810
that we gave you.

653
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,807
And take care, Thank you.
