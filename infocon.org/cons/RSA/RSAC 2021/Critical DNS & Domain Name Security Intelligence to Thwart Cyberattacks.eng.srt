1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,620
- Hello everyone, I'm David Conrad

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,980
here with Ihab Shraim.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,550
We're here to talk about Critical DNS

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,260
and Domain Names Security Intelligence

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,483
to Thwart Cyber Attacks.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,250
You're hopefully pleased to have two CTOs.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,250
Ihab is CTO of CSC and
I am the CTO of ICANN.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,700
The agenda for this talk,

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,019
I will be presenting quickly a overview

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,020
of the domain name system
ecosystem and its vulnerabilities.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,989
And then Ihab will talk about
when threats become real

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,393
and what can be done about those threats.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,220
As a reminder, if you have any questions,

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,390
please feel free to
submit them at any time

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,450
you don't have to wait
for the end of the session

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,043
to pose questions.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,321
So talking a bit about
the domain name system,

18
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:01,040
the ecosystem around
the domain name system

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,373
and its vulnerabilities,

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,570
I am the CTO of ICANN as
I previously mentioned.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,880
I've been doing this internet stuff

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,679
for a quite a long time and
have been involved with the DNS

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
for much of the 30 plus years

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,232
that I've been involved with
the internet technologies.

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,670
The DNS ecosystem is all of the systems

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
that in one way or another
impact or associate with the DNS

27
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,949
either through the
development of protocols

28
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,950
at places like the IETF or
the development of policies

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,012
at places like ICANN or
inter-governmental organizations.

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,920
It also involves folks outside

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,100
of the DNS folks like the
regional internet registries

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,820
who hand out IP addresses,

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,820
the W3C consortium who
specify the protocols

34
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,990
for the worldwide web and
involves organizations

35
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,539
like the internet governance forum

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,810
and the various participants directly

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,670
in domain name activities,

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,980
such as the registries,
registrar and some registrars,

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,950
internet service providers,
and software developers.

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,769
Those sorts of folks.

41
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,290
All of these individual
organizations and entities

42
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,290
in one way or another are
involved in the ecosystem

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,160
and are subject to the threats

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,880
that can impact the DNS ecosystem

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,930
So with this talk,

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm planning on talking about
some of the vulnerabilities

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,660
and the mitigations for
those vulnerabilities

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,390
within the DNS.

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,070
And when I say the DNS, it's actually

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,861
all the facets of the
DNS from the protocol

51
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,799
to the namespace DNS services,

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,090
the provisioning of domain
names and the software

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,113
that makes the domain
name system available.

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,040
Talking a bit about DNS
protocol vulnerabilities

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,750
and their mitigations,

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,750
as you're probably aware,
the DNS is at least in theory

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,570
simple query response protocol,

58
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,120
a person interested in
in looking up a name

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,140
sends out a query to first resolver

60
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,322
then from the resolver,

61
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,058
issues a series of queries
to authoritative servers.

62
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,600
These authoritative or
servers respond back

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,807
either with a referral or some answer.

64
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,910
And that answer is then
eventually returned

65
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,403
to the originating application
on behalf of the user.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,340
So the DNS, as it was original specified

67
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,340
had no mechanism to protect
against data corruption.

68
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,840
This meant that the bad guys
could insert information

69
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,380
into the DNS stream,

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,790
could corrupt the data and the DNS stream

71
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,179
or corruption could happen accidentally

72
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,313
through bit flips or
garbled communication.

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,649
This provided a way for attackers

74
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,707
to insert bogus information
to redirect clients

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,590
who are attempting to do a
lookup for a particular website

76
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,590
or other service to go to
attacker controlled system.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,140
The mitigation for this
particular vulnerability

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,550
as defined within the DNS protocol

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,320
something called DNS
security enhancements.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,706
The DNS protocol was
specified originally in 1983,

81
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:53,706
DNSSEC as it's known, was
originally specified in 1996

82
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,793
didn't really start seeing
deployment into 2004.

83
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,620
The pros of DNSSEC is that it
does allow trust in the data

84
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,500
regardless of the source.

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,890
DNSSEC works by providing a signature

86
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,923
cryptographic signature over the data.

87
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,690
And the trust anchor that's
configured in resolvers

88
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,453
is then used to validate
that data on reception.

89
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,730
Without DNSSEC, there's
no way for the resolver

90
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,320
to determine whether data is valid or not.

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,180
With DNSSEC, if the data has been modified

92
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,050
in any way from when it was signed,

93
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,823
it gets dropped on the
floor as a corrupt packet.

94
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,130
This allows this capability of DNSSEC

95
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,090
allows for the data to be
trusted regardless of the source.

96
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,130
It could be brought in
through the DNS protocol

97
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,500
or it could be copied from
one machine to another.

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,930
As long as the signature validates

99
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,450
the user of the data can have some faith

100
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,900
that the data was the same

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,193
as it was originally put
in when it was signed.

102
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,100
This also creates an alternative
public key infrastructure

103
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,280
with a single trust anchor.

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,119
This can be seen as addressing
some of the problems

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,120
that are existence
within the current X.509

106
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,870
based public key infrastructure

107
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,140
that of the community of trust

108
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,212
among different top level CASs

109
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:37,820
certificate authorities for X.509.

110
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,370
With the DNSSEC there is
a single trust anchor.

111
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,500
It is operated by ICANN.

112
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,550
When we make use of that trust anchor,

113
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,610
it's done in a very public fashion.

114
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,960
We record the key ceremony
as they're called.

115
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,900
We have what are known as

116
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,830
trusted community
representatives participate.

117
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,659
And it's a very secure mechanism

118
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,230
by which the trust anchor is updated.

119
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:10,010
And DNSSEC does have downsides.

120
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,188
It increases brittleness,
can enhance denial of service

121
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,700
and it does have a single trust anchor.

122
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,400
If that single trust anchor is violated,

123
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,203
the entire PKI is at risk.

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,400
The DNS protocol also did not have

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,710
any concept of confidentiality.

126
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,830
All data center in clear text.

127
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,590
The mitigation for this
is a new enhancement

128
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,900
to the protocol.

129
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,500
There are actually a couple DNS
over HTTPS and DNS over TLS.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,773
Basically that they simply encrypt

131
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,753
the channel of communication.

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,700
There's another one
coming out relatively soon

133
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,033
called DNS-over quick.

134
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,469
This is a bit controversial
because the deployment model,

135
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,580
particularly for DoH, DNS over HTTPS

136
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,000
can bypass network operators
controls on their networks.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,530
So for example, if you're
using Firefox browser,

138
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,530
the DNS queries bypass the
network operators selection

139
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,419
of the resolver, if it's configured.

140
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,420
So, and that way can
bypass some of the controls

141
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
that the network operator
would have placed.

142
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,933
The DoH and DoT only protect
the client to the resolver.

143
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,070
There are some discussions

144
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,630
about protecting resolver
to authoritative,

145
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,650
but there's some challenges with that

146
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,880
including the potential increased load

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,230
on the very busy named
servers, like the root servers

148
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,230
or the Com top level domain
ComNet org name servers.

149
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,089
Looking the protocol

150
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,380
the namespace is the universe
of all possible names

151
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,000
that are implemented within the DNS.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,510
Traditionally, they
consisted of A through Z

153
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,890
zero through nine and a hyphen.

154
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,870
And within the actual DNS queries

155
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,900
it continues to be the case

156
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,840
that the character set is limited.

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
However, recent enhancements

158
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,850
known as internationalized domain names

159
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,614
allows for additional
character sets to be used

160
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:28,950
in the presentation layer of the DNS.

161
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,097
And this results in some
risks related to the namespace

162
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:36,090
and the examples that I've provided here.

163
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,070
The first amazon.com it looks

164
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,870
unless you look carefully the
same as the second amazon.com.

165
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,660
However, the second amazon.com,

166
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,270
if you look at the second A

167
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,880
sorry, yeah, the second A of Amazon

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,510
you will see that it looks
different from the first A

169
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,600
that's because it's actually

170
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
a Cyrillic A which in the font

171
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,510
that has been used here shows up

172
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,687
slightly differently than the Latin A

173
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,980
which was the first A.

174
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,173
Unless you're paying
particularly close attention,

175
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,180
this can result in vulnerabilities

176
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,069
to phishing, spear phishing,
and those sorts of things

177
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,300
where people assume
they're going to a name

178
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,469
which isn't actually a case.

179
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,810
This was particularly challenging

180
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,280
given that it's now straightforward

181
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,069
to obtain needle cost certificates

182
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,480
that will give the browser user

183
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
a padlock that says the
connection is secure.

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,230
It is of course secure,

185
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,473
but to a potentially
bad guy owned website.

186
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,330
Second example similarly the A
in gmail.com is a Cyrillic A.

187
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:52,990
The mitigations for these
particular vulnerabilities

188
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,180
are UIs that make the IDN use apparent.

189
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,109
A number of browsers now exist that do not

190
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,609
show the Unicode version of the strings

191
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,080
but instead show what
are called the Punycode

192
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,993
the xn-- strings.

193
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,689
Registries and registrars can
limit what can be registered

194
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,189
although there have been a
number of allocations already

195
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,630
and for historical reasons,
they remain active.

196
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,420
In the end end, users
must remain vigilant.

197
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,680
I'll point out that this
isn't particularly new

198
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,000
because you know, historically
there have always been

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,530
Typosquatting type
attacks where things are

200
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,300
characters or are transposed or characters

201
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
you know, the number one is
used for the little letter L

202
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,579
whether these are vulnerabilities

203
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,040
is obviously dependent
on usage in context.

204
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,980
I believe Ihab will be talking a bit

205
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,260
about some of these
types of namespace risks

206
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,423
in his portion of the presentation.

207
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,410
Looking at the DNS service

208
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,240
there are basically
three separate classes.

209
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,500
There's redirection where the attacker

210
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,460
can change a domain name

211
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,260
change a domain name servers

212
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,700
to point to attacker or
controlled authoritative servers.

213
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,840
And mitigation on this

214
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,330
you just make sure you monitor

215
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,020
the addresses of domain servers.

216
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,020
And also if DNSSEC
validation is implemented

217
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,830
the change of the name servers

218
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,440
that have not been signed will
be detected by the validator.

219
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,440
And that particular attack
can be observed quite easily.

220
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,690
Resolver hijacking, this
is where DNS queries

221
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,123
are answered by an attacker
controlled resolver.

222
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,400
You may have already heard

223
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,579
of what are called drive by attacks

224
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,570
where people are able to break

225
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,520
into residential Wi-Fi routers

226
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,150
and change the resolver so that they point

227
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,449
to an attacker controlled resolver,

228
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,010
similarly breaking into
end user operating systems

229
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,273
and chasing the resolver configuration.

230
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,090
This is also one in which the end user

231
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,340
has to pay some attention.

232
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,410
You have to ensure that the
local configuration is valid.

233
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,870
If you run a local resolver
on the end user machine

234
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,950
you can also detect some of these attacks.

235
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,846
Unfortunately, it's quite rare

236
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,920
that DNSSEC validation
is done at the end point.

237
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,339
It's usually done at a resolver
upstream of the end point.

238
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,920
And if the attacker is redirecting
away from that resolver

239
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,823
there's no way that the DNSSEC
validation will detect it.

240
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,300
Finally, denial of service.

241
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,490
I'm sure I don't need to
explain this to this audience.

242
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,690
The DNS provides, unfortunately

243
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,260
a way of amplifying DNS attacks.

244
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,540
Since it's primarily UDP-based

245
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,610
the spoofing the source
address will allow you to

246
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,350
redirect traffic from multiple sources

247
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,350
and without any mechanism

248
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,610
to validate that the query

249
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,590
is being returned to the right place.

250
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,170
The mitigation on this is to limit resolve

251
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,380
or use enterprises should only allow

252
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,330
their internal users to use
their resolvers similar ISP.

253
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,180
It should only allow their customers.

254
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,590
There is something called response rate

255
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,160
limiting that's implementable

256
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,073
at the re resolver level,

257
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,570
sorry at the authoritative server level.

258
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,110
And that's an effective mitigation

259
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,960
but it requires the participation

260
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,733
of the authoritative servers.

261
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,910
One of the aspects of DNS service

262
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,560
that isn't quite well
understood by a lot of folks

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,349
is something known as
DNS transitive trust.

264
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,350
This is where a domain

265
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,480
is configured to use multiple name servers

266
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,810
that are in different namespaces.

267
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,140
It turns out that the way the DNS works

268
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,750
if there's a compromise of
any of those name servers

269
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,140
in any of those namespaces,

270
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,260
it means that some number of queries

271
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,510
can then be compromised.

272
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,300
So anyone attempting to look
up a name in that domain

273
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,959
can get redirected incorrectly.

274
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
These are two examples.

275
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,640
One is .EU which is actually
pretty well configured.

276
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,050
It has each one of those ovals presents

277
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,410
a part of the attack servers.

278
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,579
The second one .INT shows an example of

279
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,880
something that's perhaps
not as well designed.

280
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,890
It can present a pretty
expansive attack servers.

281
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,780
So in any of those ovals, if
the name server is compromised

282
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,219
then the attacker can control responses.

283
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,880
The moral of the story
here is try to limit

284
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,590
the number of out of
zone name servers you use

285
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,193
to reduce your vulnerability to this risk.

286
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,800
Looking at provisioning,
vulnerabilities, and mitigations.

287
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,229
And this is the area

288
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,563
where most of the attacks
are occurring these days.

289
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,780
And the registrar case,

290
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,350
the person who registers the domain,

291
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,180
if the credentials of the
registrar ENT are compromised

292
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,319
obviously the bad guy can go

293
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,990
and make any modifications they choose.

294
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,740
There is a mitigation

295
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,270
most registrars support
something called registrar lock

296
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,970
which requires an out-of-band mechanism

297
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,223
to unlock the domain for
modifications to occur.

298
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,010
In most cases, that's
an effective mitigation

299
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,793
however, it is susceptible
to social engineering.

300
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,650
At the registrar level

301
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,090
registrar can be seen as sort
of the retailers of names

302
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,033
where registries or the wholesalers.

303
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,030
The registrar, if a
registrar is compromised,

304
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,790
then any of the names that are registered

305
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,829
through that registrar can be changed.

306
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,790
This mitigation, there is registry lock

307
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,339
which does sort of the same
thing as registrar lock

308
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,882
except at the registry level.

309
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,104
And finally, with registries

310
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:31,010
if the registry is compromised in any name

311
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,010
in that name that registries
namespace can be modified.

312
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,870
These aren't theoretical attacks

313
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,040
as some of you, might've heard of tech

314
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,220
that Cisco telos called.

315
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,560
Sea turtle before that
was DNS via knowledge.

316
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,240
In those attacks both
registries and registrars

317
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,630
were compromised leading
to a significant compromise

318
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,860
of the names within those namespace.

319
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,850
Finally, software vulnerabilities

320
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,189
and mitigations vulnerability.

321
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,110
The vulnerability here is the fact that

322
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,939
the DNS protocol itself has
become incredibly complicated.

323
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,800
There's a term called the DNS camel

324
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,800
which describes basically the problem

325
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,350
of too many features being
added to the protocol.

326
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,449
The original DNS specification
was two documents

327
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,460
known as RFCs refresh
requests for comments.

328
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,480
There were about 110 pages.

329
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Currently there about 300 RFCs
that are relevant to the DNS.

330
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:37,659
Only 100 native those are needed

331
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,900
for the standard
implementation of the DNS.

332
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,960
But that does give you an idea

333
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,960
of the total complexity
of the DNS protocol

334
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,602
that works out to something
on the order of 4,000 pages.

335
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,580
Obviously everyone who's
implementing DNS servers

336
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,580
going to create bugs because
it is such a complex system.

337
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,410
So the mitigations here
are to have diversity,

338
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,160
have multiple implementations,

339
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,660
compile out or turn off
all unnecessary features

340
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,400
obviously put your domain in a area,

341
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,653
your name servers in a jail
so that if it is compromised,

342
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,563
the bad guys won't have complete access.

343
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,450
So summarizing the DNS
is a very complex system.

344
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,680
It provides a ubiquitous service

345
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,980
that's critical to the
functioning of the internet.

346
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,450
Each part of the DNS and
part of the DNS ecosystem

347
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,760
has its own set of vulnerabilities.

348
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,780
And mitigations for those vulnerabilities

349
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,133
require participation of all
the actors in the ecosystem.

350
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,250
And with that, I will hand it off to Ihab

351
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,083
and thank you for listening
to my portion of the talk.

352
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,100
- Thank you very much, David.

353
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,439
So as David indicated, David
showed us a quick synopsis

354
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,440
about how the DNS ecosystem
could be jeopardized.

355
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,930
It's a very interesting phenomenon

356
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,680
that of what's happening today

357
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,870
but what I'm going to show you basically

358
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,320
is to dovetail to what
David had mentioned to you

359
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,570
to look at the attack surface

360
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,919
and how companies are targeted today.

361
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,900
But most importantly, how do we tie it

362
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,373
to something that we see
today which is COVID pandemic.

363
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,773
Go to the next slide.

364
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,017
Just a quick one before I
begin, my name is Ihab Shraim.

365
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,167
I'm the CTO of CSC.

366
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:54,053
In fact, you can look us up at cscdds.com.

367
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,740
What I'm about to show you is

368
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,580
what are these threat vectors

369
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,800
targeting the domain name ecosystem?

370
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,330
What we have looked at
is the entire ecosystem

371
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,330
and we're tying it, as I said
earlier to the COVID pandemic.

372
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,640
And we have a lot of interesting data

373
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,320
that we would like to share with you.

374
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,770
Just to a quick background.

375
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,490
Okay, so companies today,
based on what we are seeing

376
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,680
and based on our product suite offering,

377
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,810
there really are overlooking domain name,

378
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,342
domains as well as DNS security risks.

379
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,240
What do we mean by that?

380
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,700
Well, based on our customer base

381
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,650
as you probably know
CSC is the largest B2B

382
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,660
as in corporate B2B domain name registrar

383
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,699
globally that is.

384
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,290
And we see all the phenomenons

385
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,389
that do happen on the ecosystem

386
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,480
related to the top level domain names

387
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,923
as well as the ccTLDs and
the new TLDs et cetera.

388
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,920
What we are seeing is that

389
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,390
companies are overlooking
some blind spots.

390
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,690
And we do know that they are really

391
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,000
taking security seriously.

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,240
But sometimes some of these
mishaps that we are seeing

393
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,480
that are occurring

394
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,280
on the domain name ecosystem,
the digital certificates.

395
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,280
As my colleague said that
on the DNS infrastructure,

396
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,460
these threat factors are
being a bit overlooked

397
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,959
and basically they directly affect

398
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,850
the actual foundation of
what an online presence

399
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,320
for a corporation would look like.

400
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,620
So the online presence is
crucial for any company

401
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,620
and these are the attack surfaces
that bad act first target

402
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,480
they target the corporate website,

403
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,667
they target their email info structure,

404
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,740
their target vulnerabilities

405
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,830
within the exposed applications.

406
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,310
What would that result in is
in website three directions

407
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,149
meaning for the primary website

408
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,400
if you don't take the appropriate measures

409
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,603
to protect that domain name ecosystem,

410
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,200
you can, the corporation can end up

411
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,153
with a compromised email
and network breach.

412
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,310
The brand reputation
itself could be jeopardized

413
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,300
or you can have revenue leakage.

414
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,590
You can have a gray market distribution.

415
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,649
If it's an online e-commerce site,

416
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,290
there's a multitude of problems

417
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,139
that could happen to the brand itself.

418
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,610
And in a lot of cases,

419
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,500
as we have seen with a
lot of breaches out there

420
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,110
in the past few years

421
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,189
data exfiltration is crucial to bad actors

422
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,840
because they can sell
that data in the dark web.

423
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,270
And there is a huge ecosystem

424
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,873
within the dark web as everybody knows.

425
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,730
So what the CSC offer today

426
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,900
around domains and DNS to
provide what we classify

427
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,970
as a holistic approach

428
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,580
toward protecting the online presence

429
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,120
and protecting those
digital assets online.

430
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,209
While we look at the
domain name as a portfolio

431
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,290
and we secure it, and as
my colleague indicated

432
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,190
we introduce registry locks.

433
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,190
We look at the DNS posture
and we secure the obvious.

434
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,060
And these are, like I said

435
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,060
these are blind spots that
a lot of companies overlook

436
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,330
and that gives you the
first layer of protection.

437
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,520
And then we protect the actual brand

438
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,460
meaning the brand online,

439
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,760
where it's being abused
under a multitude of angles,

440
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,760
on the gray market distribution,
counterfeit, and so forth.

441
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,050
Then we look at it from the perspective

442
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,870
of the third layer as

443
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,939
how do we protect it from fraud vectors

444
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,870
as in phishing, malware, et cetera.

445
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,629
In other words, we look at

446
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,550
the presence of a corporation online

447
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,320
as a 360 cyber security coverage

448
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,793
toward detecting and mitigating
these threat vectors.

449
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:43,949
What we mean by mitigation,

450
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,110
we conduct enforcement

451
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,110
and we are the largest
enforcer on the internet today.

452
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,929
And in fact, we are the
number one UDRP firewall

453
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,013
on the internet.

454
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,620
So how do we tie the dots

455
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,149
with what David had mentioned to you

456
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,083
and what are these threat
vectors we are to alluding to.

457
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,840
Well let's take what we are
seeing for the past year or so.

458
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,639
We are under a pandemic, COVID pandemic,

459
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,640
and we decided to conduct a
research comprehensive study

460
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,082
around that phenomenon.

461
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,450
So basically what we've
done is in real time,

462
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,840
we are looking at the
domain name ecosystem

463
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,092
comprehensively that is.

464
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,930
We're looking at the brand presence online

465
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,720
and the phishing threat vectors
targeting these spreads.

466
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,910
And we do it by looking
at multiple platforms

467
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,000
from a domain name perspective monitoring,

468
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,090
from internet monitoring
as in search engines.

469
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,490
From a brand protection space

470
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,490
we look at marketplaces
on e-commerce monitoring.

471
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,040
Social media with all the platforms

472
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,889
that are available out there.

473
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,233
And of course we look at mobile apps.

474
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,860
So just want to give you a quick summary

475
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,179
and then we are planning
to dive into the data

476
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,801
to give you some more
detail about what took place

477
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,840
between January of last year, until today.

478
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,179
What we have found,
what our study has found

479
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,180
is there are there were
to date about 325,000 plus

480
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,150
COVID related domain name registrations.

481
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,723
These are new registrations
associated with COVID.

482
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,040
The top targeted country

483
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,800
unfortunately is the United States.

484
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,320
The top GTLD which is .COM

485
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
has 64% of the 325,000 newly
registered domain names.

486
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,939
On the ccTLD side it's .co.uk

487
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,332
which constitute about 2.5% plus.

488
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,300
The top ISP targeted ISP

489
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,780
which is a favorite ISP for
a domain name registrations

490
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,530
and to launch these threat factors

491
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,560
against a certain brand is GoDaddy.

492
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,810
What we also found is more than 645 plus

493
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,810
individual online stores
associated with selling a cure

494
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,500
as in COVID cure are 65,000 searches

495
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,500
as the average search results
for COVID cure through Google.

496
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,820
So let's take the data deeper.

497
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,360
Let's tie that with main events.

498
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,699
Events that took place
that we are all aware of.

499
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,973
And let's relate that

500
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:50,220
with our domain name registration

501
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,220
based on the 325,000 and see
the trend, what is that trend?

502
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,020
What we found, if you
look at my cursor here.

503
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,379
In the very beginning, when
it all emerged in China

504
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,120
which is around January,
February timeframe of 2020,

505
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,949
is that the domain registrations

506
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,700
began to spike up a little bit

507
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,120
and then it spiked up extremely high

508
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,280
when the U.S reported 2000 deaths.

509
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,290
Well, that tells us that the bad actors

510
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,990
are reacting to the
events that the ecosystem

511
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,270
of domain name registration
really tracks the main events.

512
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,220
In fact, if you look at the next peak

513
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,120
which will be the pandemic stimulus checks

514
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,639
meaning they can launch attacks

515
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,100
to steal identity steal
the stimulus check funding

516
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,590
from the recipients of that stimulus check

517
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,082
within the United States.

518
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,770
We'll also look at this trend.

519
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,089
When the vaccine became
available we see a spike.

520
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,780
What does that also tells us?

521
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,120
It tells us that when
an event takes place,

522
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,010
a lot of domain name
registrations take place,

523
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,810
but have does that affect
the drop domain names?

524
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:13,107
We said, "Fine, let's
look at the vaccine data."

525
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,200
So if we track, when
the vaccines came about

526
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,130
and to tie the dots just in three months,

527
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,540
we find that those vaccines are today on

528
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,560
as you can see the green institute

529
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,580
the constitute the registrations

530
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,510
and look at the drops that are trailing

531
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,299
meaning the time interval
to make the attack happen

532
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,900
is sure meaning it's event driven

533
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,040
meaning it has to have a dynamic nature

534
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,470
to try to track these threat
vectors and mitigator.

535
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,830
In other words real time
threat vector management

536
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,793
is key here.

537
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,690
All right, so let's take a look at

538
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,220
the data that I have
been discussing with you.

539
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,060
Let's see how, what are the percentages?

540
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,260
What we found is from the 325 plus

541
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,879
a thousand domain names
that got registered

542
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,080
75% of them were connected with GTLD

543
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,419
ccTLDs is about 9.7, almost 10%.

544
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,540
But the new TLDs is
the big surprise is 11%

545
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,659
which is quite high

546
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,523
and new TLDs like online site, et cetera.

547
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,040
sLDs as in secondary level,
top level domain names,

548
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,010
sorry, second level domain
names constitute about 3.6

549
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,300
which is a significant number of the

550
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,940
an sLD can be for
example like a black post

551
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,130
or Myshopify, et cetera.

552
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,330
As you can see here, we really track

553
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,090
and tag the data very
closely and very precisely.

554
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,850
And the reason why this study is important

555
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,240
by the way this study is well sought out

556
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,790
by a lot of universities.

557
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,290
A lot of entities that do research

558
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,230
are asking for that data from us

559
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,170
because we happen to be
the one who started with it

560
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,170
and really tracked it
very in very minute detail

561
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,943
with respect to that
domain name ecosystem.

562
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,300
So let's take a quick summary.

563
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,300
So who are the top countries,
who are the top ISPs,

564
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,440
what are the top keywords?

565
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,540
Now, we're gonna zoom on the
data to the keyword level

566
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,149
to the brand association

567
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,793
and the threat vectors
targeting these brands.

568
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:50,370
Not surprisingly the United
States takes number one.

569
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,733
Germany, France and here's
the surprise, Russia.

570
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:56,159
That means they have good environments

571
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,430
and environments that can be hacked.

572
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,180
So Russia, it was a surprise

573
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,610
to us to be the number five slot.

574
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,520
Now, of course we have data

575
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
and we can rank it all the way down

576
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,740
to even if you have one frat

577
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,740
or one domain name associated
with alive of DNS record

578
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,020
but we show here five results.

579
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,590
The top ISPs of course,
we've talked about GoDaddy,

580
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:30,020
CloudFlare, Amazon web
services, and Google cloud.

581
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,170
The keywords are interesting.

582
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,360
We're gonna zoom now on the keywords.

583
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,973
COVID-19, coronavirus,
they take top two ranks.

584
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,430
And then COVID, and you're gonna see now

585
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,510
the data that I'm gonna show you

586
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,933
is all associated with that data set.

587
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,173
Okay, great.

588
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,850
Anyway, so we divided the
data into three sections

589
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,780
from January to June

590
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,780
and then from June and
forward from November to now.

591
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,129
As you can see the top ranks do change

592
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,139
depending on what the data
set we are dealing with.

593
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,929
And that's kind of important to note

594
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,020
because it depends on
where are the search terms

595
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,983
and the event that is taking place.

596
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,440
All right, as my colleague referred to

597
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,389
the homoglyphs are critical.

598
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:33,500
We see that in domain
name spoofing variation

599
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,210
but I would like to share with you

600
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,449
that data set that is
a little bit different.

601
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:43,359
So we wanted to go track
the data with respect to

602
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,800
all right 300, you know, 325,000 plus.

603
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,060
Where are the brands being hit?

604
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,230
What, in what category?

605
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,913
We find that 36% is
associated with treatment,

606
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,180
testing, 32% e-commerce
attacks as an e-commerce stores

607
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,123
associated with certain
brands that takes 31%.

608
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,110
By the way 38,000 of these
domain names contain Coronavirus

609
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:19,913
and 152,000 contain the strain of COVID.

610
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,120
So we developed an internal technology

611
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,100
that it clusters the data

612
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,100
and it looks out at
geographically by country, by ISP

613
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,880
and it connects to a seller.

614
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,880
This is a critical
technology one of a kind

615
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,760
it's called clustering technology.

616
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,630
And it allows us to get
to know, or the attack

617
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,600
or the threat vector targeting
the brand is gonna go.

618
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,910
This is an example of a targeted brand

619
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,850
but this is another example

620
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,850
of where the owner of that bad actor,

621
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,970
he's selling counterfeit boxing

622
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,660
and labeling to whatever you wanna sell.

623
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,660
In other words, he's
giving you on a, you know

624
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,530
a zero to 100 counterfeit
customized logos,

625
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,810
boxing, et cetera, to ship these products.

626
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,253
It's quite interesting.

627
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,333
Of course attacks are
connected with heat map.

628
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,400
Almost every country had
experienced that attack

629
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,470
but the heat maps were probably the most

630
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,500
where you download the heat map itself

631
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,000
to track Coronavirus across the world.

632
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,350
And then you introduce
malware to that site

633
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,480
because there's an infection.

634
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,160
So how does that happen?

635
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,681
I'd like to just go quickly

636
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:49,681
and show you how the
attack vector happens.

637
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,740
Normally, a bad actor
is after as you know,

638
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,089
stealing identity,
insurance money, et cetera

639
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,370
it sends a scam.

640
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,819
And the scam they target
a certain group of people.

641
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,820
And in this case, we are
zooming on older folks

642
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,390
because it's easy to steal their money.

643
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,270
So how do they do that
with false advertising?

644
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,009
Basically they send either an email

645
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,483
or in social media they send a fake site.

646
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,629
By clicking on it
introduce the malware into

647
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,870
that particular machine and
then the host is infected.

648
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,580
And as soon as the host is infected

649
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,140
either it get marred by botnet

650
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,620
as in through a command
and control instruction

651
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,020
meaning that's the second
layer of instructions

652
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,060
and now they own the machine

653
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,740
or they harvest the data
out of that machine.

654
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,540
What do we do? What should we do?

655
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,940
Quickly we would recommend to have a seek

656
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
a global secure registrar

657
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,640
to protect that domain name ecosystem

658
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,650
associated with that brand.

659
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,390
We track your online presence

660
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,569
from the perspective of how
the brand is being used online

661
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,440
and where's the abuse against that brand.

662
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,930
And use tools like early warning detection

663
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,720
toward critical threat
vectors, CSC offers that

664
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,410
and then work with a
global enforcement company

665
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,450
that will mitigate that problem for you.

666
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,450
So in summary, David and I
have given you a quick synopsis

667
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:32,500
about what is happening out there

668
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,180
as in threat vectors
targeting the domain name

669
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,009
and DNS ecosystems.

670
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,080
We wish you the best of luck.

671
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,020
Please ask us any questions you may have

672
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,503
and thank you very much
for listening to us.
