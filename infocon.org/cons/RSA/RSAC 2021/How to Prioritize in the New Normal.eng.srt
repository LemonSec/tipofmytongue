1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,260
- Good morning, we're really
glad to have you here today.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,770
I have a wonderful panel of experts

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,940
and we're gonna spend the next 40 minutes

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,930
talking about the world that
we faced over the last year,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,609
and the lessons we can learn from that,

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:17,930
that we can apply to the future.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,930
This isn't going to be a panel
where we deeply pontificate

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,163
about the new normal and where,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,479
and what we think might be
there, or might not be there.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,879
Really we're gonna explore what happened

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,490
and how we can draw those lessons forward.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,860
And so I have, I wanna
start with my panel members

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,230
and allow them to introduce themselves.

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,339
And as they do that, I want
them to answer this question.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,060
What have they seen as
the most significant,

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,110
and difficult security
challenge they've faced

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,690
over the past year?

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,890
So let me start today
with Mark Weatherford.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,699
- Hi Bobbie, and thanks
for having me on the panel.

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,360
So I have two answers here.

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,300
The first is that I left
my last full-time job

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,300
in March of last year, just
as COVID was kicking off,

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,670
and I spent much of
the last year traveling

24
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,640
around the US in my RV.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,610
So my biggest challenge was
trying to find good Wi-Fi

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,790
and actually believe it or not

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,710
there's actually good wifi in most places

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,669
in the United States, even
some really remote locations.

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,330
But I would say the real
challenge that I saw,

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,273
is working with a number
of startup companies.

31
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:40,810
They were challenged with
basically maintaining

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,970
the continuity they had with
their customer pipeline.

33
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,539
So as their customers, and large companies

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,323
began shrinking and and
contracting to deal with COVID,

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,389
they maintain the
connections and the liaison

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,840
that the small companies had
with the bigger companies

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,410
became more and more of a
challenge as they scrambled

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,149
to maintain their current pipeline,

39
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,259
but still trying to meet their quarterly

40
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,440
kind of relationships.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,060
So that was a big challenge.

42
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,860
And I think, you know

43
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,960
that's probably one that's the big company

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,660
certainly didn't have to
deal with in the scale

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,500
that the startup company world was dealing

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,820
with on a daily basis.

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,530
- Yeah, it's the discrepancies, right?

48
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,130
The haves, the have not,
this was a situation

49
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,730
that was felt very differently I think

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,390
by different individuals in this space,

51
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,873
Mike would you care to respond?

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,500
- Sure, so I'm Mike Brannon.

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,500
I lead infrastructure early
efforts at national gypsum.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,459
We're a construction
materials manufacturer

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,220
with a couple locations in Canada,

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,023
and a little bit more than
30 locations around the US.

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,740
We were in a sense a little bit fortunate

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,140
through the pandemic.

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,559
A lot of the household formation,

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,070
and some of the migration

61
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,250
away from the big city office tower,

62
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,350
stimulated demand for
residential construction.

63
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,350
So our business kind of took
off in terms of challenges,

64
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,160
we've always tried to serve the business,

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,600
and deliver what they needed,

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,109
and the thing we hit really
big time directly in security

67
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,660
but more broadly across the business

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,609
was a lot of unexpected data points,

69
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,890
events shifts that none
of us could anticipate.

70
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,820
So we're always very much
invested in having a plan,

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,579
and work in a plan,
and trying to optimize.

72
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,900
This particular year in review,

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,680
there were just so many
different incidents, events,

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,430
and things that happened
where you had to adapt

75
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,263
week to week.

76
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:04,660
And you never knew, even
from the beginning of a week

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,020
to the end of the week,

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,480
how it was gonna end up.

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,420
We started referring to Thursday

80
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,200
as hollowed out shell Thursday
because frequently, you know

81
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,969
you were running low on resource

82
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,220
but yet our biggest thing
was the unprecedented

83
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,270
amount of uncertain events
that just seem to happen

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,303
week to week, day to day
throughout the past year.

85
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,530
- It's interesting Mike, because Terry,

86
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm gonna go to Terry next
in an industry that was

87
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,850
I think really dramatically
impacted by the last year

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,990
the commonality about that uncertainty

89
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,700
I think is interesting between yours

90
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,370
where you had demand and
not sufficient supply.

91
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,450
And Terry, I think, you
know, we, we would argue

92
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,450
that you had supply and
instantaneous loss of demand.

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,520
Terry, please.

94
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,930
- Hi, I'm Terry Griffith.

95
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,070
Thanks for that lead in part

96
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,130
because we've had a very interesting year.

97
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,723
Obviously we didn't expect
COVID to go quite like this,

98
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,670
but we definitely had opportunities.

99
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,100
And what I mean by that is

100
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,330
we have a very loyal customer base.

101
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,330
And so we, we were able to
both accommodate future demands

102
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,253
and try to maintain what we
were doing at the same time.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,550
We went into, you know, keep
the lights on sort of mode

104
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,050
from that we learned to adapt.

105
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,990
We had the, hollow Thursday point.

106
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,990
We never used that name,
but I did like that Mike.

107
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,920
And cause it, you know,
there was a lot of stress,

108
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,283
and flexing, and moving, and adjusting.

109
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,109
So we definitely had the opportunities.

110
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,950
We had lots of challenges, right?

111
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,860
We haven't really sailed since last March

112
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,820
but hopefully this is
all winding down now,

113
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,349
and we start to get back out there,

114
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,500
and learn from what we've done, right?

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,540
The adapting piece has
been very beneficial.

116
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,830
We definitely had some
really big wins internally

117
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,800
things that guests may
or may not ever see,

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,633
but things that we've done

119
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,690
that we have changed for the better.

120
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,820
And so, you know, there's,
I'm grateful for that.

121
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,000
And I think the company is too

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
there's an opportunity
we took away from it.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,960
- And that's, I think really
interesting to think about

124
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,046
in that way, that the lessons
that you're bringing forward

125
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,349
can then be applied.

126
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,350
It as much as it was a year of
really unusual market forces

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,170
the unfortunate pandemic activity,

128
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,990
I'm struck by a sort of a common theme

129
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,170
amongst the three of you

130
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,010
that we're used to being
a data-driven industry.

131
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,099
And that it was really
difficult in this environment

132
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,100
to be so data-driven and
kind of move forward.

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,280
Was there a particular
source that you went to

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,150
in order to find resources,

135
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,549
and find data to help you
in the planning activity?

136
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,550
I mean, cyber events didn't
stop as we went forward.

137
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,010
I think, you know, as much as
it was the unfortunate year

138
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,880
of COVID it was also
the year of ransomware.

139
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,840
And so, you know, we were
all fighting every day

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,003
to stay on top of the cyber
events that were there.

141
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,270
- Yeah, we've leaned hard
on all of our partners

142
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,270
and I've really appreciated
the network of peers

143
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,830
in the community sharing
and communicating together

144
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,143
about some of this.

145
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,390
We built some good connections
that served me well

146
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,270
on the security front.

147
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,229
And, you know, I'm
thankful for having made

148
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,500
some of those investments a
little bit ahead of this event

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,720
so that you were a little bit prepared.

150
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
We were also kinda fortunate,

151
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,100
we were shifting our architecture away

152
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,560
from a very on-premise environment.

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,370
We retired a mainframe a year ago.

154
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,530
We're shifting much more
toward the public cloud

155
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,330
for everything we do.

156
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,750
And for most of what happened,
we shifted our infrastructure

157
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,170
and architecture ahead
of the pandemic striking.

158
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,700
So we were a little bit lucky maybe

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,599
some might say prescient, I don't know

160
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,390
but that worked well, and
then the network of partners

161
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,350
and peers has been great

162
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,530
even though we've all
been kinda stuck at home

163
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,199
and not able to get together

164
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
there was a lot of sharing going on.

165
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,290
- It's interesting because
studies has really played out

166
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,290
your story, that the the amount
of digital transformation

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
that had been going on or had been planned

168
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,280
prior to the pandemic, hitting with Excel,

169
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,620
was either stagnated and then accelerated

170
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,650
or accelerated throughout that activity.

171
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,540
And I think there's still
a bunch of pent up demand.

172
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,990
Mark, I was struck by your comment

173
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,150
about small companies
and we think about them

174
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,680
as being a place where innovation happens.

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Do you think we're about
to release that innovation

176
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,380
that it's there and has been waiting

177
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,593
or how do you think about that?

178
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,273
- Well, yeah, it's funny.

179
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,700
I follow the investment in
the venture capital community

180
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,110
a lot right now, and there is more money

181
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,000
waiting on the sidelines today

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,990
looking to invest in small companies.

183
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,110
So that's a roundabout way
of answering your question

184
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,290
that I think what I'm seeing is

185
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,290
there's a lot of new
innovations happening right now.

186
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,530
And I'm, you know, I just
wrote an article yesterday

187
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,930
for Forbes on this,

188
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,670
but there's a lot of innovation

189
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,599
being fostered out of the
federal government now, which is,

190
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,710
I mean it hasn't happened like
this in a long time, you know

191
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,233
with the infrastructure plan, you know

192
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,920
there was an announcement out
of the white house last week

193
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,920
that DHS, CYSA and DOE are
going to work collaboratively

194
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,240
in a public private partnership model

195
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,620
with the electricity
industry to look at ways

196
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,523
to innovate the grid and
basically enhance the grid,

197
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
there's a lot of the cyber
threats that we're seeing today.

198
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,400
So the answer is yes.

199
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,930
I mean, it's like, there
are so many startups

200
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,939
or so many people,

201
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,240
I probably talk at least with
one or two people every week,

202
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,690
that's saying, I have this
idea what should I do?

203
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,060
So I think there's a lot of
interesting things coming out

204
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,933
you know, not to get caught
up on too many buzz words,

205
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:17,050
but AI and ML and the
cloud are literally just,

206
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,449
they're burning the house down.

207
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,580
So it's a lot of exciting, exciting things

208
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,610
happening right now.

209
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,370
And I think to your earlier
point, the last 12 months

210
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,690
where it was kind of
where it was slowed down

211
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,590
for a lot of reasons now,
it's like it's blowing out.

212
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,170
So I think it's gonna be
an exciting next year,

213
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,223
or two, or three.

214
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,849
- So, Terry you're on
this roller coaster ride

215
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,300
where things are going
well, you stop sailing,

216
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,719
now you're having to make

217
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,680
really started prioritization decisions.

218
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,670
Can you talk a little bit how you thought

219
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,150
about prioritizing, how the uncertainty

220
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,840
either helped or hindered

221
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,840
and what kind of risk characterizations

222
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,807
and conversations were you able to have?

223
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:15,235
- That's a very complex question.

224
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,730
Cause there was a lot of conversations.

225
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,740
Initially, we thought
we'd be down for, you know

226
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,740
maybe six weeks and here we
are, really what had happened.

227
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,530
We have a good strong leadership team

228
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,020
and there was conversations
with them on once it passed six

229
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,020
or eight weeks, you know how
do we, you know, do this,

230
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,439
do we keep the lights on
we just focus on that,

231
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,690
minimize the impacts to our
guests as well as our employees?

232
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,880
And those conversations happened
every two to three weeks.

233
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,300
Security was fortunate enough
to be part of those, right?

234
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,620
Because obviously we don't
want to let our guard down

235
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,340
during something like this.

236
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,070
And so we were prioritized pretty well

237
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,320
in comparison to some of
the other groups, right?

238
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,290
Because they didn't
really cut our resources,

239
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,610
they didn't really cut our budget

240
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,490
because they knew the
importance of what we were doing

241
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,113
to protect the guests
and protect the company.

242
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,580
But we did have to prioritize, right.

243
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,080
A lot of capital
expenditures were cut back,

244
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,660
or refocused to other things
that were more tactical,

245
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,250
much like Mike we had already undertook

246
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,370
a number of projects that was
improving our infrastructure

247
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,900
making it better for going forward.

248
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,810
And so we expedited that, right?

249
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,939
We put the capital that we're
gonna expand on other things

250
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,230
into that to finish that to
make our entire workforce,

251
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,483
you know, work from home.

252
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,630
So there was that, but
communication was key.

253
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,810
The leadership team met with
employees every two weeks

254
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,479
by virtual meeting, right?

255
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,313
This is where we're at.

256
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:46,660
This is what we're doing.

257
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,523
And so that helped ease
some of the fears with it.

258
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:55,960
You know, some of it is
you know luck or blessing

259
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,630
or whatever you wanna call it.

260
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,423
We had enough things in motion
that we were able to adapt.

261
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:03,810
And I was using that word before

262
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,640
we were adjusting the things
and Royal is flexible enough

263
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,970
to try to pivot when we had to.

264
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,320
And I think they did a pretty decent job

265
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,893
in general what we had to face.

266
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,600
- I think Mike, you faced
the opposite, right?

267
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,310
Where all of a sudden you
had an abundance of riches

268
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,719
in terms of business.

269
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,270
How did you think about, how
did that risk conversation go

270
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,270
and security in the context of that?

271
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,090
- So I've always been a
part of a conversation

272
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,760
with leadership around
broad enterprise risk.

273
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,500
And one thing that this year
brought that was completely new

274
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
and unexpected was the
pandemic affected all of us.

275
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,560
If you kinda go on the way back machine

276
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,160
it affected all of us
regionally in different ways.

277
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,360
We operate in all different regions.

278
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,910
We operate in a number
of different States.

279
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,360
The States each had a response.

280
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,560
And so we had some States that we operate,

281
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,969
Pennsylvania, California,
they shut everybody down

282
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,080
and had lockdown, and made
us shut our plants down,

283
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,000
right at a time when demand
was pretty good for us,

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,420
and then, you know, things
kinda even took off after that.

285
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,329
So we had as a company,
we had to kind of adapt.

286
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,650
We had to do some interesting
things business wise,

287
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,170
I ended up being very
engaged in collecting

288
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,010
all sorts of data from
different data sources

289
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,600
that were out there about
relative pandemic risk

290
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,120
and what kinda cases are happening.

291
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,860
We also got heavily
engaged in messaging people

292
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,900
because we had this thing

293
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,829
that was a security
awareness training platform

294
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,413
but it became a training
platform for other things

295
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,750
because we could kinda certify

296
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,840
people have been through education.

297
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,530
We had to educate people about masks

298
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,630
and social distancing
and all sorts of things.

299
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,320
We implemented some protocols around.

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,080
Are you safe to come to work?

301
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,090
Have you been exposed in
your home outside of work?

302
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,450
There was just a ton
of things coming at us,

303
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,930
and so we had this blessing,
if you wanna call it that

304
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,930
of a surge on demand we needed
to keep our associates safe

305
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,720
and keep bringing them to work

306
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,030
so that we could keep making product.

307
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,430
And all that was on
top of an unprecedented

308
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,239
amount of fishing and worry,

309
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,490
and just people feeling very provoked

310
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,600
by events in their lives.

311
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,900
And so now they get, you
know, the phishing email

312
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,240
or they get the thing that
tries to provoke a response

313
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,900
and they're already stressed.

314
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,823
So it's been a very challenging year.

315
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:54,530
I'm feeling like we were
blessed not to have ended up

316
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,520
in the headlines in a bad way.

317
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,439
We had a number of large
suppliers by the way

318
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,440
that did get jacked up, and we
had a cardboard box supplier,

319
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,170
big paper company that
went entirely offline

320
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,690
for about six weeks
during a ransomware event

321
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,890
couldn't run any of their factories.

322
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,720
And, oh my gosh, I'm sure you'd
have seen my head on a spike

323
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,329
if something like that had
happened in any of our factories.

324
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,369
So I'm thankful that we
made those investments

325
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,989
a little bit ahead of time
and avoided the worst case

326
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,440
that some people had happened.

327
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,890
- Yeah, I'm struck by your
comment and something I know Mark

328
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,570
you have been writing about

329
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,169
and that Dell, John's money
at Dallas, very focused on

330
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,860
and that's the power of a
converged security team, Heron

331
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,689
and Mike you've made the case

332
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,840
for how a converged
security team supported you

333
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,980
through this activity, right?

334
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,710
Leveraging the cyber security platform

335
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,653
for physical security and safety benefits.

336
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,460
- Yeah, and that's been very
much a part of who we are.

337
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,740
As a company, we're a manufacturer,

338
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,350
and a capital intense industry

339
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,070
information technology as a
whole is an extra cost item,

340
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,039
not something that really
can drive much profit,

341
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,370
but on the good side, because
we've been very consolidated,

342
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,979
and very integrated into
what the business does

343
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,260
as we've done these different things.

344
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,940
When we did our big new SAP,
when we did the networking

345
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,850
needed to do barcode
labeling and all my plants.

346
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,949
When we did those things, we
made sure we architected it

347
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,080
and we built it to be secure
by design and then deployment.

348
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,260
And so each time we get a chance
to do that, we inject it in

349
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,770
and away we go.

350
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,050
And then our team again
is just very tied in

351
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,649
to what the business is doing.

352
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,760
So it keeps us in a close partnership

353
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,707
- That alignment with business,
I think is really important.

354
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:05,535
Oh, please, Mark.

355
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,879
- I wanted to just jump in there also,

356
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,536
you mentioned convergence,
this is, you know

357
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,690
this is something that
we've been talking about

358
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,270
insecurity for a long time.

359
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,030
And, when I was at NERC
is when the first time

360
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,470
it really came home to me is, you know,

361
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,190
one of the utilities had a
security incident out in a field

362
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,640
at a substation.

363
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,230
They knew that the substation was offline

364
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,230
but this DSO was not talking to the CISO,

365
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,060
who was not talking to the
physical security guys.

366
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,370
So this, the substation was offline

367
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,800
but they didn't know who to send.

368
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,570
They didn't know if they
should send a guy with a gun,

369
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,960
or a guy with a wrench,
or a guy with a laptop.

370
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,740
So, you know that's the first time

371
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,840
this convergence came to me.

372
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,659
And I think, you know, over the past year,

373
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,710
working with a number
of very large companies,

374
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,900
COVID has provided an
additional impetus to that.

375
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,080
So now you have HR involved here,

376
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,830
HR is trying to figure
out what employees have,

377
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,270
you know, have been affected

378
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,300
or what employees have
potentially been effected.

379
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,610
What employees have been to locations

380
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,429
where they may have been affected.

381
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,860
And we're, you know what
employees do we have to have

382
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,280
come into the office.

383
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,280
So tying in the physical
and logical identity

384
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,690
of people has been, it's
never been more important

385
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,523
than right now.

386
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,939
And trying to figure out a
company is trying to figure out

387
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,460
how they converge all this data

388
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,420
how they can take batch data and, you know

389
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,290
entry data and log in data,

390
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,629
and how they can tie this
all together to give them

391
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,360
kind of this common operating picture

392
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,790
of what's happening in their environment

393
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,540
has been really profound.

394
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,480
And a couple of the
companies that I work with

395
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,090
have done really well.

396
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,120
They've transitioned really quickly

397
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,312
into developing technologies
that satisfies these needs,

398
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,110
as Mike said, you know mentioned SAP.

399
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,939
SAP is really been kind of
leading out on their technology,

400
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,010
their ERP technology being able to tie in

401
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,430
and bring all this stuff together.

402
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,760
So it's been an exciting time from that,

403
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,340
from a technology perspective in that way.

404
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,720
And this convergence, you know, is

405
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,060
I've been a proponent forever

406
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,240
because the efficiencies are obvious,

407
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,533
and the cost savings are you know,

408
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,209
instead of having three
siloed security teams,

409
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,780
you have one security
team with perhaps two

410
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,820
or three disciplines
within that security team.

411
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,230
But the fact is they're all communicating

412
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,903
and talking better together now.

413
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,520
- And I think that inclusion
of business continuity

414
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,680
or enterprise resilience in that team

415
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,760
is even more important, because it's,

416
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
when I think about the
cyber related events

417
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,110
that we're having to deal with, Mike,

418
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,743
your comment about a site
with a ransomware attack

419
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:11,743
that took it down, if you
silo your business continuity

420
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,000
away from that, that becomes, I think,

421
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,750
an inefficiency that's a part of it.

422
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,420
So I think that's equally
an important element.

423
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,950
But a slight pivot though
because I think we've talked

424
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,890
a lot about here, about companies
who've had the resources

425
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,760
to really focus on the challenges.

426
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,290
We need now, to have this concept

427
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,730
of the security poverty line,
and Mark you've talked about

428
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,030
the fortune 500 and the unfortunate 5,000.

429
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,450
How do you, it strikes
me when we talk about

430
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,960
the haves and the have nots

431
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,210
that the last year has really
exacerbated this line here.

432
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,970
And how do you think about
approaches for the next year

433
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,893
from this Mark?

434
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,409
- Yeah, so, you know, Bobbie,
from our days working at DHS

435
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,410
this was one of the
challenges, the, you know

436
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,120
the fortune 500, get all of the oxygen.

437
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,550
If there's a security
incident that, you know

438
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,548
at a fortune 500 company, it's
on the wall street journal

439
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:20,390
and the Washington post the next day.

440
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,850
But if you're for him, you
know, and this is not intended

441
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,629
to be a derogatory term in any way

442
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,130
but if you're a part of the
unfortunate 5,000, you know

443
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,570
not only don't you get the visibility

444
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,450
which could actually be a
good thing in some cases

445
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,700
but you don't necessarily
get the resources

446
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,700
the companies aren't typically
as maybe forward thinking

447
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,020
as some, the fortune 500

448
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,100
where they actually are
putting money and investing in.

449
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,370
So I think your comment
about the, you know,

450
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,169
the security poverty line
is it was really a suit

451
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,950
because you know, Wendy,

452
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,530
I think she first coined
this term back in 2017 or 18,

453
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,170
or something like that

454
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,405
but it basically was meant that, you know

455
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,450
companies understand their security gaps

456
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,620
to build better awareness, but
they don't have the resources

457
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,219
or the budgets to buy and
implement and manage, you know

458
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,373
the security controls to
actually reduce that organism.

459
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,560
So I think, you know,
the security poverty line

460
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,730
is actually responsible
for a lot of the tech debt

461
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,210
and the compensating controls
that we see accumulating

462
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,780
in a lot of organizations.

463
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,830
So where do I see it going?

464
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,939
I think, you know,
there's as I said earlier

465
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,030
I think there's some
positive things happening

466
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,840
you know, as Mike said, you know

467
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,760
it was kind of a time to say,

468
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,050
okay some of these projects
that we had planned

469
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,733
and we're thinking about maybe
now's a good time to do them.

470
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,850
And a lot of companies did that.

471
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,709
They did make some investment

472
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,320
they were able to do some
massive shifts in technology

473
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,663
and transformational kind of
upgrades over this past year.

474
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,720
So I think the future
is it has to be better

475
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,899
because I'm more on because
the federal government

476
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,980
is gonna become getting
in more and more involved.

477
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,727
It's just, there's no doubt about it.

478
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:26,650
And you know, whether you like regulation

479
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,600
and, or not, it's coming, mark it down

480
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,419
you heard it here first, we're
gonna see more regulation

481
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,920
across the board on
cybersecurity and privacy.

482
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,333
And if the federal government
does it right you know,

483
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,260
that can be a positive thing,
but you know, if they don't

484
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,000
I really think they need
to bring the private sector

485
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,300
into the conversation as they
start making these decisions

486
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,080
because there are too many
unintended consequences

487
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,020
and we've seen far too much
of that out of the government.

488
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,350
- Yeah, so Wendy's
approach talks about money,

489
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,860
about resources, but it
expands that concept,

490
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,899
I think in a really profound,
it talks about talent

491
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,390
and influence being equally
elements that are necessary

492
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,490
and you might have resources,
but with insufficient talent

493
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,500
or insufficient influence,

494
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,350
the other trends I've seen a lot of

495
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,719
over the course of this
year is sort of a heating up

496
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,300
of the talent challenges
globally in this space, right?

497
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,700
As companies have had
the kind of uncertainty

498
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:36,910
that they've experienced.

499
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,200
Other companies who have the
riches have been able to draw

500
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
that talent away.

501
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,750
Mike Terry does either
one of you wanna sort of

502
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,720
explain on how you see
this talent challenge

503
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,990
particularly for organizations
that can't, you know

504
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,310
don't have cash to outlay
to bring in the top talent

505
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,629
into their organizations.

506
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,553
- Sure, I'll jump in first.

507
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,570
And we do right.

508
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,120
We were travel and leisure, right?

509
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,969
We sell funds.

510
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,910
So when you're competing
against some of the big banks,

511
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,220
they have what I call
golden handcuffs, right?

512
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,630
They can pay above market and get people.

513
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,688
That's what they do.

514
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:18,850
So we look for other ways to do this.

515
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,530
We obviously, when we are sailing

516
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,970
we have very good perks for employees,

517
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,540
so that's one of the selling points.

518
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,080
That was the reason I came to the company.

519
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,230
I love to go on cruises and, you know

520
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,693
the opportunity was there.

521
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,870
The other thing we do
is we look for people

522
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,030
coming out of the military service.

523
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,379
We work with Skills Bridge, bring them in

524
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,430
that has been working very
well for us throughout 2020.

525
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,820
We brought people in, they
basically it's like an intern

526
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,300
but they're already a
skilled technical person.

527
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,440
They work for six months.

528
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,573
Most of the time, our goal is
to convert them to employees.

529
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,210
But that's something that
we're just ramping way up

530
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,510
because it has been
highly successful here.

531
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,590
The other thing is we look for, you know,

532
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,320
folks out of college that
maybe have some passion,

533
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,870
and some background and they're hungry

534
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,840
to get out there and learn things.

535
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,042
You know, if you have the right attitude

536
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:13,949
you can train anybody.

537
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,050
So I have tried to keep a
few really senior people

538
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,493
and I try to supplement in other facets.

539
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,080
- Yeah, so, well, I'll pile
on to Terry's last comment.

540
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,330
That's absolutely a technique we use.

541
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,230
I don't have the budget or
the headcount allocation

542
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,280
if you will, to do a lot.

543
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,620
So I have to be very careful

544
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,120
and I have to manage what head
count I'm allowed very well.

545
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,219
We're kinda blessed in that
Charlotte, North Carolina

546
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,700
is a great place to live,

547
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,870
and so if we pull someone
here from somewhere else

548
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,530
chances are they're gonna
wanna stay in the area.

549
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,850
And that sort of thing,
which has been great.

550
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,340
We're also in North Carolina

551
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,480
but coming a little bit of a tech hub.

552
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,790
So it's becoming easier to
get access to tech resources.

553
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,850
All that said, I've also had to figure out

554
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,850
how to leverage every form of
partnership known to mankind.

555
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,730
So I've got all kinds of
managed service partners.

556
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,900
I've got consulting partners.

557
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,900
We even have some local tech
where we'll go to companies.

558
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,903
We have a huge Microsoft presence here

559
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:23,440
and I'm very invested in them.

560
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,680
They have people that are on
their bench, or interning,

561
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,160
or doing things, and you'd be amazed

562
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,660
at how inexpensive you can access talent

563
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,640
that's on someone else's bench.

564
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,250
You just have to be creative,

565
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,140
and you have to be
flexible in your timing.

566
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,080
You know, so sometimes that works.

567
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,280
Again, we stitch it together.

568
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,860
It's like a patchwork quilt

569
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,899
that you hope doesn't look
too bad when you're done

570
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,760
but that's kinda what we're doing.

571
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,760
We try to have some lead
people, architect type people

572
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,930
that are kinda the glue that
binds all this together.

573
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,260
And that's kinda difficult.

574
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,580
That's especially difficult to preserve,

575
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,570
but again something we're
working on all the time

576
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,659
and feeling the pinch all the time.

577
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,390
But Mark mentioned it a
little bit earlier, too.

578
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,390
I'm amazed at how some of my
partners have leveraged AI

579
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,870
and ML and other aspects of their tooling

580
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,719
to where the tools are getting smarter.

581
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,770
So, you know, we used to
only have the availability

582
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,170
of putting human eyes on
something in order to analyze

583
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,520
and make decisions more and
more tools are getting better.

584
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm not gonna say perfect
because again I think AI and ML

585
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,520
is like an untrained baby wandering round.

586
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,980
So it can be a little dangerous sometimes,

587
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,963
but it's interesting, the
progress that you see being made.

588
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,110
- So I'm gonna weave Mark talent
about good wifi in his RV,

589
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,169
wherever he is in the world.

590
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,930
And Mike, your comment
about North Carolina

591
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,710
as we go forward, I mean,
talent is no longer has to be

592
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,960
so regionally oriented.

593
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,550
How do you think about that kinda,

594
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,980
how does that change
the way you think about

595
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,010
sourcing and engaging?

596
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,379
- Well, so particularly in SAP

597
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,320
that's where it really
sort of was a two by four

598
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,740
to the forehead.

599
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,770
We've now got talent all over the world.

600
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,420
And the only thing a little
bit stressful about that

601
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,710
many of the folks listening
in or even on this call know

602
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,570
that you end up with talent
from Eastern Europe, you know

603
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,679
talent from somewhere in Asia.

604
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,670
And the next thing you know

605
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,250
you're having conference calls 24/7.

606
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,390
So that can be a challenge,

607
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,170
but it's amazing the
availability of talent

608
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,420
and you can have work.

609
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,520
I mean, we've done project
work where we followed the sun

610
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,300
with the work where teams have handed off

611
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,960
and that's gone amazingly
well, I, you know

612
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,120
back a few years ago, if you
told me I'd be doing this

613
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,219
I'd have laughed at you

614
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,043
or maybe wanted to punch you
in the nose, but here I am.

615
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,010
- Yeah, I think we talk
about this is work from home

616
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,270
in many instances, at
least for me with folks

617
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,520
it's almost as though
I'm now living at work.

618
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:25,523
And so that I think that's important.

619
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm gonna then go back for a second,

620
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,643
and let's talk back about
uncertainty and speed.

621
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,139
One of the things that we all experienced

622
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,160
with this need to be incredibly agile

623
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,290
about the decisions we made comfortable

624
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,490
with the amount of uncertainty that we had

625
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,743
in order to make those decisions.

626
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,959
McKenzie has commented that
this isn't gonna go away

627
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,050
like a normal crisis

628
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,639
and that we're going to have to continue

629
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,840
in this higher speed environment

630
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,530
that the 12 month planning
cycle now feels like

631
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,670
it's six months, or four
months, or even three months.

632
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,220
How do you see that impacting your ability

633
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,103
to build a viable
long-term security program?

634
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,360
- So that's a tough question.

635
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,740
- Well, that's why you're
the experts, right?

636
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,060
That's the problem that
everybody listening is facing.

637
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,159
- One thing we've done,
we do our level best

638
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,850
to be in a framework kind of approach

639
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,719
and then within that broader framework

640
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,970
to be very agile and to adapt.

641
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,160
And I think that's one of
my big, big lessons learned

642
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,560
out of this year, because
you go in, you know

643
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,980
you think you have a year
or more plan ahead of you.

644
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,420
You go into the year, like
the one we've just survived

645
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,590
and you realize how crazy that idea was.

646
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,720
And I'm not really sure
that we'll get to go back

647
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,940
to the way it once was anymore.

648
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,420
I think we'll have to be way
more adaptable, way more agile

649
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,639
in our approaches and willing
to get unexpected data

650
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,100
or events that arrive and
then deal with them as we go.

651
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,469
But, having said that there
exists a body of knowledge

652
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:21,029
most of the good frameworks out there,

653
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,639
we're very much an adherent
to some of the CIS framework.

654
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,629
The frameworks absolutely
give you a core set of guides

655
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,159
that you need to be following,

656
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,899
even as you kind of hop
around to address something

657
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,923
that's emergent and urgent.

658
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:42,210
- So we have about five minutes left.

659
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,150
I wanna give you each the chance of

660
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:49,530
sort of leave our audience
with this question.

661
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,540
And Mark, let's start with you.

662
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,540
What is the single COVID-19
related security trend

663
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,233
that were used worries you the most?

664
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,500
- Yeah, well, I guess my
answer is probably not

665
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,780
what anything that you would
think it is, but I think

666
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,553
that misinformation, and
disinformation, and fraud,

667
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,810
are that's the biggest
threat that I see right now.

668
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,750
You know, we've gone
through so much with COVID,

669
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,350
and with vaccines and with the elections,

670
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,350
and everything that's
happened in the United States

671
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,350
in the past year, I think
people will have become almost

672
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,670
they've become very distrustful

673
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,400
of almost everything and everyone

674
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,220
And that's not good for society.

675
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,680
I mean, you know, we have
people arguing with experts now

676
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,750
because of something they read on Google,

677
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,280
they saw on Google that,
you know, that contradicted,

678
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,030
what an expert said, so I think, you know,

679
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,700
misinformation and disinformation,

680
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,450
COVID spawned a lot of these
things that are gonna be hard

681
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,180
to recover from, I'm
not sure quite frankly,

682
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,000
how we put the genie back in
the bottle and we, you know,

683
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,980
I guess healthy paranoia is good

684
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,620
but I think we've crossed over
maybe a little bit too far.

685
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,513
So that's what worries me the most.

686
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,793
- Terry.

687
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:23,890
- I do like what Mark
said about misinformation

688
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,890
cause I think that is 100% spot on.

689
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,040
There's a lot of that.

690
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,380
I think that from

691
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,320
strictly from an instant
response perspective,

692
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,720
what we're looking at is a huge increase

693
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,450
of phishing attacks, very
complex ones in many times,

694
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,903
and ransomware associated with those.

695
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,970
So that worries me, we saw
a huge spike during 2020

696
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,069
about 500% increase of unique attacks.

697
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,710
So that's got us on our guard

698
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,560
but we've also taken other
considerations around it using AI

699
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,730
and some automation that
we didn't have prior.

700
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,688
So we're trying to
accommodate the best we can

701
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:08,265
but definitely that's gonna continue

702
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,299
as long as there's some fear
and misinformation out there

703
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,450
people will be trying to take money

704
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,062
or advantage of individuals.

705
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,430
- Mike.

706
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,600
- So I guess trying to
stitch together a little bit

707
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,460
about what the other panelists have said

708
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,460
I'm very worried that
we're seeing an increase

709
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,550
in crime as a business inside
the cyber warfare in a way.

710
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,770
So I'm not so worried
about nation state attacks

711
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,800
as much as I am the fact
that there are nations

712
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,790
in the world where you can
make a really good living

713
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,009
as a cyber criminal.

714
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,750
And then there's almost a
network of cyber crime out there

715
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,410
working against us.

716
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,879
And it feels like this year
they've really ramped it up.

717
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,950
And then at the same time to
tie back to what Mark said,

718
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,069
I've got people that are
struggling and under stress,

719
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,860
and very responsive to the
buttons those guys push.

720
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,533
And so all those things
really worry me going forward.

721
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,970
- Yeah, I think as much as we spend time

722
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,379
as security professionals
thinking about the technologies

723
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,320
that we need to put in place,

724
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,200
this year, I think has reminded all of us

725
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,460
that this is a very human business

726
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,460
and a very human set of
experiences that are there.

727
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,090
And I think for me, one of the key themes

728
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,390
I heard from everybody that people are,

729
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,960
remain our most important resource

730
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,570
and that are focused on their
care and their contribution

731
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,070
and their innovations is
really a vital element.

732
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,310
So I really appreciate your time today.

733
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,759
I look forward to continue
discussion on this topic.

734
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,970
I think like y'all I'm
optimistic about the year ahead

735
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,270
but I'm skeptical as well

736
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,170
because there are many places
where it could go either way

737
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,310
and so I'm happy to
have you all on the team

738
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,823
and a good partnership going forward.

739
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,806
- Great conversation, enjoyed it.

740
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,139
- Thanks Bobbie.
