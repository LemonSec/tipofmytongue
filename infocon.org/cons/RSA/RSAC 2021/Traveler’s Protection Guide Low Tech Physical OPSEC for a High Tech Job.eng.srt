1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,590
- So good morning, good evening,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,529
and good afternoon, everybody.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,850
My name is Dan and I would
like to thank everybody

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,559
for joining our session for
Traveler's Protection Guide.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,270
I'm here joined by Marco

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,633
which is director of
GReAT Europe in Kaspersky.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,840
- Hello, also welcome
from my side, Dan and me

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,810
we're part of GReAT at Kaspersky

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,140
and just a very brief overview,

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,140
Kaspersky GReAT is a very
elite team of researchers.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,570
We're doing highly advanced investigations

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,343
and analysis into threats.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,593
That's our main profession.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,139
- And throughout our almost 11 years

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,730
it's been 11 years Marco.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,000
No, like since we started,
our team was started.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,630
We visited, we went through
a lot of conferences.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,060
We had a lot of travel and due to

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,350
this requirement, we had to devise a set

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,350
of upset, upset practices,
best practices for our travels.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,240
This was due to the fact

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,720
that we had sometimes to
protect our digital assets.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,030
And sometimes we had to protect
our physical assets as well.

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,660
So throughout our presentation today

25
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,280
hopefully you will see some new

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,910
or hear some interesting
tips and tricks how to

27
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,910
improve your upsets for the,
your future travels or for

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,443
any new device you might be getting.

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,613
So let's start.

30
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,437
I would say that a very
famous person had mentioned

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,309
like a long time ago and
he said, the following

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,580
that, "If you know the enemy,
you, and if you know yourself

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,990
you can win almost any only any battle."

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,150
And that is like, I think
it applies to today.

35
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,460
Today's info as well, but also very

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,460
another famous person said
something interesting as well.

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,440
And Marco says that when you're

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,440
in a defense and somebody is
trying to actively attack you

39
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,810
then you have to make only one mistake.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,223
And when you do that, the
own you, it's game over.

41
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,220
Now, the problem is, is that
they can do as many mistakes

42
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,240
as possible when they
are in the offense stage.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,250
But when you're defending yourself

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,800
you have to be very, very careful.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,800
And that's why this is what
we're gonna talk today about.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,430
And our presentation is gonna
be split into two parts.

47
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm gonna be talking
about the digital part

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,340
of your protecting your
digital side of your devices.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,590
And then Marco was gonna talk

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,013
about protecting your physical realm.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,440
And let's start about what
we know based on our 11 years

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
of experience from various kinds
of attacks and revelations.

53
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,960
We know that internet traffic
might end is monitored.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,530
Whether if it's meta data
that is being collected

55
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,690
or actual traffic that is being recorded

56
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,120
like for a later
inspection, whether if it's

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,120
like deep packet inspection
or like light monitoring,

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,450
internal traffic might be logged.

59
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,450
So the moment your traffic
leaves your own network

60
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,453
you don't control it anymore,
but somebody else, the ISP,

61
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,330
the provider, the upstream
provider, they control it.

62
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,447
They handle it to your traffic

63
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,580
and you don't know what's
happening with you.

64
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,123
Also, your

65
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:19,260
all your communications can
be intercepted and stored

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,070
whether if they're like phone calls

67
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,500
or like messages or photos,
or like text messages

68
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:30,070
they might be stored voice calls as well.

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,460
And there are not a few cases we've seen.

70
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,530
We've seen some cases
within our company as well

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,330
where laptops were seized at borders.

72
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,450
Also, you can see you, there were a lot

73
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,943
of instances in the past
where digital devices

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,130
or devices falling

75
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,930
digital data were stolen from hotel rooms.

76
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,090
Whether, if it's your laptop or whether

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,568
if it's your mobile phone,
burglars or attackers have access

78
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:07,050
to somehow managed to get
access to your hotel rooms.

79
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,880
And then they managed
to steal those devices.

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,187
And ultimately in order to
gain access or to steal data

81
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,620
computers and servers were
hacked and then monitor deployed

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,800
on those ones, whether if
it's like watering hole attack

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,360
or direct network penetration

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,883
in order to gain access to sensitive data.

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,940
So in order to do that

86
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,740
we've devised a set of
minimum OPSEC rules.

87
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,450
Of course, those are not the only rules

88
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,880
that we are following, but those are

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,630
those should be the
ones that would help you

90
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,630
and can help you kickstart
you're upset practices,

91
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,669
best practices.

92
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,620
And we start with the operating system.

93
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Nowadays, most of you travel
with a laptop and this laptop

94
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,100
it may be it's provided by the company

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,750
or maybe it's your own personal laptop.

96
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,520
Now, it's very important
that the data stored

97
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,280
on your hard drive, whether
it's an SSD or an M2 device

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,179
or like, hopefully not
anymore, it's spinning disc

99
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,280
this data needs to be
encrypted because, and

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,280
as I mentioned before, if
your laptop gets stolen

101
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,360
then the data is at risk.

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,200
So what can you use?

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,670
Some SSD vendors they offer encryption

104
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,473
but you have to be really careful,

105
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,170
not to be confused with only look options.

106
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,610
So you have to be very careful

107
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,610
that the encryption offered
by the SSD is real one.

108
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,870
So because of that

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,790
we actually prefer to
use software encryption

110
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,673
whether you use Windows or MacOS,

111
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,580
then for those two operating systems

112
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,919
you have an option built in option

113
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,550
in your operating system
to encrypt your drives.

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,060
And it's called BitLocker in Windows

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,163
and FileVault in MacOS.

116
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:16,686
If you're running Linux or
any other Linux's variant

117
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,090
you have Linux Unified Key Setup, LUKS

118
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,520
which is pretty, pretty, it's good.

119
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,210
It's stable.

120
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,820
It offers exactly the same protection as

121
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,909
though the two technologies
that I mentioned before

122
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,130
and it's open source.

123
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,130
So that's pretty cool if you
don't want to use any of these

124
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,640
especially if you're on
Windows, you can also

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,827
use VeraCrypt.

126
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:46,669
VeraCrypt, comes from True Crypt.

127
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,220
And VeraCrypy has been multiple
times has been verified

128
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,320
from, with a thorough security audit

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,530
and they have the source

130
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,750
of the entire source code, open source

131
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,290
and they are pretty good,
really commend them.

132
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,720
And the advantage of using VeraCrypt is

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,130
that they can also provide
you a plausible deniability

134
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,310
which is a function
documented by VeraCrypt

135
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,830
by using encrypted
containers, hidden containers.

136
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,683
And you can find out more
about this in their hub.

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,909
Okay. So let's assume your
operating system is secure

138
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,150
and that you, at least have

139
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,563
some physical protections
in case of theft.

140
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,900
What about your communication?

141
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,159
What about your data that you receive

142
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,219
and send to other parties?

143
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,860
Whether it may be your colleagues

144
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,960
or their family members or your partners?

145
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Well, on average, one person
sends and receives, sorry

146
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,510
sends up to 30, 40 emails per day.

147
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,510
On average, sometimes I have
days where I send like only one

148
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,213
or two, or sometimes
I send more than that.

149
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,939
We communicate using email.

150
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,470
And the problem is that
once your email inbox is

151
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,069
like illegally accessed or
like unauthorized accessed,

152
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,300
then an attacker has
access to all your emails.

153
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,329
That's why it's very important.

154
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,220
And we strongly recommend

155
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,220
that you use a GPG to encrypt
all your email communications,

156
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,430
and it's not hard to do it.

157
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,810
There are a lot of programs

158
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,500
and most email clients
are actually compatible

159
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,500
with the GPG standard and they
allow you to encrypt to send

160
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,550
and all send or all receive
emails you can decrypt them,

161
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,300
but there's a catch

162
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,500
if you're using RSA keys
to encrypt your emails

163
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,320
be careful to only use a 4k, bit keys.

164
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,190
Keys which are like 1,024
bits, or like 2048 bit keys.

165
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
They, we don't know for sure

166
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,380
but there are rumors
that they can be cracked.

167
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,689
So keep, keep your keys safe.

168
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,160
That's very important and
change your keys regular.

169
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,310
You can do this one

170
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,609
by using a token using a security token.

171
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,630
So instead your key being stored
on a laptop on your laptop,

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,050
on your operating system

173
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,350
your RSA private key can be stored

174
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,820
on a security token, which
has special functions.

175
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,099
And I will talk about security tokens

176
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:45,663
a little bit later in a few slides.

177
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:52,030
The real danger in having
your keys stolen is

178
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,130
that even attacker has
access to your private key

179
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,710
and your decryption
passphrase for a private key.

180
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,340
And that attacker has access

181
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,600
to all your previous conversations.

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,470
That's a really important, and by the way

183
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,910
if you want to ask us something

184
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,980
if you want to chat with us, we are here.

185
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,020
We are on the chat.

186
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,650
We're happy to answer any

187
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,390
of your questions and please bing us.

188
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,330
If you have any questions,
we are gonna, we are here.

189
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,693
We can answer them in no time.

190
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,800
Okay? So we talked about email.

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,290
But you know, sometimes
email is not enough

192
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,329
sometimes emails are slow

193
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,270
and you want to get the whole
of that person pretty fast.

194
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,550
So we, in our team, we
are using text messages

195
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,550
or using voice nowadays
with this entire pandemic

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,560
like work from home is like the new norm.

197
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,229
And we are using tools which allow us to

198
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,173
be virtually in the same room.

199
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,900
So what can you use

200
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,913
in order to make sure that
your communications are secure?

201
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, we recommend

202
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,040
and maybe you might have heard
some, one popular solution

203
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,430
which is Signal and Signal
became quite popular.

204
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,100
Also after Elon Musk tweeted about it

205
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Use Signal and also
became popular when a lot

206
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,233
of WhatsApp users migrated
from WhatsApp to Signal.

207
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,820
But we also recommend Threema

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,940
if you never heard about it.

209
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,050
What's interesting about
Threema compared to Signal is

210
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,560
that Threema doesn't
require a phone number

211
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,550
in order to create an account.

212
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,282
You are not bound.

213
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,430
You're not legally connected

214
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:49,660
or you're not stuck
with your phone number.

215
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,069
If you want to create
a new Threema account

216
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,530
you just remove the old one
and you create a new one

217
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,980
which is something that is
not very easy to do in Signal.

218
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,500
So it's pretty cool.

219
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,420
Session is another app, which is pretty

220
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,420
interesting as well as Wire
and props to once to you

221
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,050
if you recognize the Ricochet logo

222
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,560
from the top left
Ricochet is pretty awesome

223
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,087
because it uses store in order
to like talk to other users.

224
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,599
Jitsi Meet is also
something that we recommend

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,920
and it's pretty useful

226
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,800
because it allows you to
set up your own server

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,349
in your own infrastructure,
in your own cloud.

228
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,450
So that's pretty cool.

229
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,680
Okay. Now you're using all
these kinds of products

230
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,463
but what about your
connection to the internet?

231
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:46,620
What should you use if
you are in a public cafe

232
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,943
or if you're in your hotel
room using the hotel's WiFi.

233
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,270
Sometimes it's not a good idea
to use an untrusted network.

234
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,020
And because of that, we recommend running

235
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,723
setting up a VPN provider.

236
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,140
Now you might ask ourselves, Hey

237
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,960
what VPN providers should I use?

238
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,617
Like then what do you use?

239
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:14,510
Right? And my answer is I use
multiple ones, but we command

240
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,280
and we dropped a link, which
can see it in the bottom

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,050
of our slider safety
from Safety Detectives.

242
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,060
They have a good comparison
for the best VPN providers

243
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,939
that you should use, and you
should decide for yourself

244
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,530
but you have to be careful

245
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,839
that you shouldn't use VPN provider

246
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,840
which is free because
when something is free,

247
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,069
which is a rule

248
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,690
for like everything in life,
then you are the product.

249
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,150
So choose something that you pay a little

250
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,120
for the services.

251
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,480
And you know, that it's pretty
strong and pretty capable.

252
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,350
Now, as I mentioned, that we
should using security tokens.

253
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,540
Those are like small
keys, which can do some

254
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,420
cryptographic functions on behalf for you.

255
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,520
And the advantage of those keys is that

256
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:09,079
they are enclosed and an attacker,

257
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,360
even if they, if the attacker

258
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,030
they compromise your
computer, they can only

259
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,547
they cannot access your
private key stored on this

260
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,863
the security token.

261
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:22,090
They can only use the security token

262
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,410
in order to do some functions, but you can

263
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,040
protect yourself by enabling touch option

264
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,660
in the security key.

265
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,760
And there are multiple vendors,
multiple security keys.

266
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,800
But I think the last one
that we tested were YubiKeys.

267
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,800
And I think Marco, I think
you use the nano YubiKey.

268
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,040
How was it?

269
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,579
Was it good?

270
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,630
- Yeah. It's quite awesome.

271
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,550
But be aware that you need, a USB slot

272
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,370
usually that's at least what I do.

273
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,530
- Yeah. And basically it,
you trade one USB port

274
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,363
you just insert it into your laptop

275
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,700
and you keep it with you all the time.

276
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,880
Well, assuming that most laptops
have two USB ports or three

277
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,713
I think that's okay.

278
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,823
You know, I think that's,
that's pretty good trade-off.

279
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,270
So research, we dropped
links to three vendors

280
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,199
for security tokens and
do your own research

281
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,170
but please use security tokens because

282
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,860
they're useful for when
to protect your accounts

283
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,250
for two factor authentication.

284
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,130
And two factor is really
important and we will discuss it

285
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,860
in the next slide, but it's something that

286
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,719
I want to like make you extremely aware

287
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,720
of is that no matter how
many protections you develop

288
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,560
no matter how many antiviruses
you have on your computer

289
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,869
Like how many VPN lines you have

290
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,270
like the most secure
device ever in the world.

291
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,949
If you're talking to a source over like

292
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,170
the most secure channel ever

293
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,859
if I like hypothetically
the most secure channel ever

294
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,810
if the receiving party is compromised

295
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,010
then the data you are sending
to the receiving party

296
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,040
is also compromised.

297
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,659
So it's very important to understand

298
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,710
that not only your
device needs to be secure

299
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,710
but also your receiving smart
device needs to be secure.

300
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,617
And the reason you should also
deploy those OPSEC tricks.

301
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,240
are not only for your protection

302
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,533
but also for your party's
protection as well.

303
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,100
And lastly, as I mentioned,
the Perfector edification

304
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,540
I think that since we are at
online security conference

305
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,963
we are at RSA conference.

306
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,750
There are multiple vendors
providing two factor

307
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,140
authentication schemes

308
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,590
and you should enable two
factor whenever possible.

309
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,770
Most online accounts nowadays

310
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,840
they offer two factor authentication.

311
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,830
You can enable two factor authentication

312
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,679
on your SSH sessions.

313
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,220
Whenever you're administrating servers

314
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,890
you can enable it almost everywhere.

315
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,450
So it's very important to do that

316
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,030
to use security token, security keys,

317
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,129
to achieve this goal.

318
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,200
And it's also important to mix and match

319
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,460
use different email
addresses for different types

320
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,460
of sensitive data and have a
plan in case you get hacked

321
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,720
ask yourself right now, like, or tomorrow

322
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,190
or when you go to bed, like
what happens if I get hacked?

323
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,590
If what happens if attackers
get access to my email address?

324
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,350
What happens for attackers to get access

325
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,350
to the main account, which
is also an administrator

326
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,350
on the active directory
server or in my company,

327
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,480
what would happen there, have a plan.

328
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,630
And remember that all the tips

329
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,900
and tricks that I showed you today is not

330
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,520
because we want to hide from somebody.

331
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,230
We want to prevent abuse of information.

332
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,240
We want to make sure that

333
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,850
if something happens that
our other security mechanism

334
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,689
in place to protect against this attack

335
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,200
and with this being said,
hopefully I hope you had

336
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,120
like you found some
interesting tips and tricks

337
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,770
from my side of tips and
tricks about the digital rep.

338
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,770
And now I will pass the
microphone Marco to talk

339
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,870
to you about tips and
tricks for the physical rep.

340
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,870
- Thanks Dan, right after
all the more digital side

341
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,062
of things let's get physical.

342
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,530
Especially while traveling
there is one common rule

343
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,970
and that's never leave
your equipment alone.

344
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,920
That's just the common rule.

345
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,340
There is no question about it.

346
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,590
No why, what, for never leave
your equipment unattended

347
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,949
at any time.

348
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,833
That's important because if
you do, bad things may happen.

349
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,689
Having said that let's
start at the beginning.

350
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,530
So imagine you go on a trip.

351
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,620
What do you need to do first
is check the legislation

352
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,453
of the country

353
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,830
and also the stability
safety of the country.

354
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,530
Because there may be countries where

355
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,420
it's a high risk that your
equipment make get stolen

356
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,600
or that certain additional controls

357
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,949
while entering the country, maybe there.

358
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,530
So just be aware of that and
travel and pack your equipment

359
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,803
based on this.

360
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,180
A very good trick for
that is the protection

361
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,480
against Evil maid attack
I'll show in the next slide

362
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,190
and always be aware that even a short time

363
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,190
of unattended devices could
lead to dangerous situations.

364
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,680
There are tools like for
example, the rubber ducky attack

365
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,490
where you have a huge mass of keystrokes

366
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,590
which can be transferred to a device

367
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,223
in order to conduct any kind of attacks.

368
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,830
The evil maid attack Heston M says,

369
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,639
some third person who is not

370
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,520
authorized gets access to your computer.

371
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,393
For example, turns it on and
does bad things about it.

372
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,190
There is a tool developed
by a colleague of mine

373
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,210
which uses the smart
data in order to identify

374
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,120
if a device was powered on probably

375
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,080
while you were not having it on your side.

376
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,230
So think about that.

377
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,870
The tool is free and that's a very nice

378
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,870
and easy first step into the
field of securing your devices.

379
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,730
When you're on the road of course,

380
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,880
there are many, many
things you have with you.

381
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,240
Let's start with your pocket.

382
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,150
In your pocket, you have
tons of cards probably.

383
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,550
For payment, for identification,

384
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,149
from my employer, from your hotel room

385
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,080
even, and many of these
cards nowadays has some kind

386
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,080
of RF functionalities like
RFID, certain NFC types

387
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,870
and so on.

388
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,189
And of course there are many,
many threats about that.

389
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,800
No time to really list all of them.

390
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,800
So think about your cards
and get protection for it.

391
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,630
Like there are some shields
or even pockets to put them

392
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,820
in to make it unavailable
for third parties, to easily

393
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,683
read them out and use this
data probably against you.

394
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,810
Going further, there is of course

395
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,090
more wireless tools you may have with you.

396
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,649
You may have a mouse, you may
have even a keyboard with you.

397
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,120
And of course, when it's wireless

398
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,399
there may be certain kinds

399
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,750
of attacks which could
potentially be done.

400
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,510
Like key checking, key sniffing.

401
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,640
So record the transmission
from your wireless device

402
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,240
or even in checked commands
in the communication channel.

403
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,073
So always check

404
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:40,240
that your devices you
have, if they're wireless

405
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,553
that they're not vulnerable
to these kinds of attacks.

406
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,990
And also within KeyJacks like
shown here on the picture,

407
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,420
there may be certain manipulations

408
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,150
that RF chips are implanted.

409
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,793
So you were simply not aware of that.

410
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,430
A very famous example of
that are the O.MG cables

411
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,430
for example, which has quite
extensive functionality

412
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,420
that attackers can get remote access

413
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,080
through that cable on certain devices.

414
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,600
But of course also think always
about a simple power adapter

415
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,850
because that device speak enough

416
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,013
that it could be anything inside it.

417
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,320
What you can do to protect yourself is

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,320
of course don't trust cables,
equipment from third party

419
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,000
you don't know, and
you can also use tools.

420
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,370
For example, like you USB condom

421
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,550
which simply cuts of the data
transmission functionalities

422
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,940
and only allows the power functionality.

423
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,450
When you, for example,
want to charge your phone

424
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,890
these are very basic examples

425
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,623
but very effective in the end.

426
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,760
So imagine you get to
your room at the hotel

427
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,470
what's the first thing you wanna do?

428
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,830
And you should, it's put
out the do not disturb sign.

429
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,280
Of course that's not super
advanced, it's just a sign.

430
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,260
But to be honest, it
can show, first of all

431
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,250
that you may be in the
room, which is already

432
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,730
something people may not
easily enter your room then.

433
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,080
And also the staff of
the hotel, for example

434
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
may not enter just randomly.

435
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,649
So that's very basic thing.

436
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,550
And let's be honest, if you just stay

437
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,620
in this hotel room for one or two nights

438
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,800
do you really need a cleaning for that?

439
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,993
I mean, come on.

440
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,209
While you're in the room,
check your environment.

441
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,520
The first and very nice thing

442
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,370
many people probably know from
a crime series in crime shows

443
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,370
on TV are so-called two-way
mirrors go into the bathroom.

444
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,870
There probably you have a
mirror and check if it's maybe

445
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,803
a two-way mirror.

446
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,659
This example with the fingertip
is of course not 100%.

447
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,780
You can also knock against the mirror.

448
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,990
And if there's some kind of
hollow sound, it may also

449
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,803
indicate that it's
probably a two-way mirror.

450
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,810
It's very simple, but
check that just to be sure.

451
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,060
And while you're already
in the bathroom room

452
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,950
that is something more you can do there.

453
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,880
You can do very sensitive
communication because one thing to

454
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,880
fight against audio bugs is white noise

455
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,360
a white noise is equally distributed noise

456
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,929
over the frequency spectrum

457
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,250
and a very natural
source for that is water.

458
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,600
So just turn on the shower
for example, you don't have to

459
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,530
stand under it, of course.

460
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,760
And if you don't want to use your bathroom

461
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,410
for communication, of
course, you can do it

462
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,900
in other rooms as well.

463
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,640
Then you may have an FM radio or even just

464
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,280
call a certain website

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,583
which just randomly generates
white noise for you.

466
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,530
But that audio PACS is
probably not the only thing.

467
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,342
Audio could be recorded by third parties.

468
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,409
I mean, voice is vibrations basically.

469
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,610
And in the room, you may have a lot

470
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,439
of different things which
also received the vibrations

471
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,210
and start vibrating by themselves.

472
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,860
And there are certain techniques.

473
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,500
For example, against the window

474
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,400
or even a light bulbs to read

475
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,980
out the vibrations and
turn it back into voice.

476
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,840
So even remote third
parties could theoretically

477
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,663
receive what you're
talking about in your room.

478
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,370
Having fought that another
thing are of course

479
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,073
video bugs.

480
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:13,240
A simple trick against hidden spy cameras

481
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,130
which are sadly, nowadays
quite easy and cheap as well.

482
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,730
And it's also reported quite
often that they're also used

483
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,730
in a rented apartments and the
like to ensure of course the

484
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,323
security of the rooms.

485
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,280
There are these devices where
you can abuse to reflection

486
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,240
of the lenses of spy cameras
in order to detect them.

487
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,240
It's not super easy if you're
not used to, but it's a very

488
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,550
simple thing to do at first if
you have such kind of device

489
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,453
or you can build one by yourself.

490
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,469
A bit more, I wouldn't say advance,

491
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,730
but proper method, as well

492
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,480
is just turn off the
light, use a digital camera

493
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,250
or your camera from your smartphone, which

494
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,670
in many cases do not have
infrared filters in place

495
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,440
and try to find infrared
sources in your room

496
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,690
because the video recording
is especially interesting

497
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,870
when it dark.

498
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,870
So they use infrared lights
and sources in order to record

499
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,230
and capture what's going on in the room.

500
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,933
And you can use that to detect them.

501
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,520
A bit more advanced

502
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,040
and also may cost a bit is
a third method I'd like to

503
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,533
show you is thermal imaging.

504
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,720
So there are adapters
either for your smartphones

505
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,490
or also standalone devices.

506
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,390
They cost some amount of money,
but it's really interesting

507
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,390
because many or most of the
electric devices, I mean

508
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,280
they generate heat to a
certain degree and you

509
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,970
can use these kinds of
thermal imaging devices

510
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,940
in order to spot there any
hidden electronic devices

511
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,640
in your hotel room.

512
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,683
That's quite interesting and efficient.

513
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,373
Good thing to try out at least.

514
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,420
When you found some back in
this direction, what to do very

515
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,040
easy is covering also
things you're not sure

516
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,670
about where it's suspicious,
but you cannot, for example

517
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,463
just turn down the TV or
whatever, just put stickers on it.

518
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,970
Also, in some cases it
may be a legal question.

519
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,530
So always have some tape or
stickers with you where you can

520
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,960
simply put on the things
for a suspicious about

521
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,273
to be a bit more sure on that side.

522
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,340
What many devices nowadays
are not always using

523
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,340
super advanced and crazy radio
frequency control systems

524
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,620
but many use simple WiFi.

525
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,500
So why not getting some yeah.

526
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,030
Standalone WiFi tool like
this one, just as an example

527
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,899
they're way more out
there, but not for you to

528
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,290
connect with your devices to the internet

529
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,290
but to use them to detect
other hotspots and WiFi devices

530
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,409
you can use the Mac addresses for example

531
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,480
and also the names of
hotspots in order to identify

532
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,650
potential spy devices.

533
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,500
And of course, legally,
that's a question in

534
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,390
certain countries, you may
also send out dos packages to

535
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,913
such kind of devices in order
to just disconnect them.

536
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,230
Bit tricky, but it's a quite interesting

537
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,550
area to play with and to think about

538
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,723
because it's not that
advanced and expensive.

539
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,240
In the end, these are just a few examples.

540
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,580
They raised the level of
course, to make it harder

541
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,580
for an attacker to easily
spy on you and observe what

542
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,410
you're doing and talking about.

543
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,520
But fundamentally, most of the
things we've mentioned here

544
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,290
is the awareness.

545
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,760
Be aware of your devices,

546
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,090
your communication channels,
your communication behavior

547
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,260
and your physical environment.

548
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,670
Prepare your digital
space at 10% of before.

549
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,023
And it's that simple encryption.

550
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,880
And on the other side,
your physical space.

551
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,680
Be aware of what's around you check

552
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,010
for potential unwanted devices.

553
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,090
In many cases, it is easy.

554
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,870
You don't need a specialized bag full

555
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,470
of super expensive equipment.

556
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,470
There are these small tricks
to make it possible for you.

557
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,360
I hope you can try that.

558
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,360
I hope you had some nice
takings from these talks.

559
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,080
Thanks also to Dan for his
side on the digital take.

560
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,510
