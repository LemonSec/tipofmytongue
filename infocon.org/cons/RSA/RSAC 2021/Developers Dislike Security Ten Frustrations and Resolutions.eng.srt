1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,327
- Hey folks, welcome to this session,

2
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:05,160
"Developers Dislike Security:

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,960
10 Frustrations and Resolutions."

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,020
My name's Chris Romeo.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,899
I'm the CEO of Security Journey

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,350
and super excited to be here today to talk

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,150
about security culture through
the eyes of the developer.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,520
So the agenda that I have
for our session here is one,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,480
I wanna introduce you

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,320
to the idea of the DevSec disconnect.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,430
Don't worry, we're gonna
get into what that means.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,090
Then I'm gonna talk about 10
frustrations that I've seen

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,740
that developers have with security.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,310
Then I'll introduce an idea
called developer empathy

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,770
or how can we walk a mile in
the shoes of our developers?

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,603
And from there,

17
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,040
we'll go into the 10 frustrations

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,570
that developers have with security.

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,870
And for each of those, I'm
gonna give you a description,

20
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,500
and then I'm gonna talk about a resolution

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,670
because we can't just sit here
and talk about the problems.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,110
We're gonna talk about
some solutions as well.

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,130
And so that's what we're gonna do

24
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,240
with the resolutions is
talk about how can we build

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,230
a positive security culture
that's collaborative

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,390
and how can we counter the frustrations

27
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,290
that our developers are experiencing.

28
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,360
And from there, we'll
go into our conclusion.

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm gonna take questions
throughout the session here.

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,430
So feel free in the question

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,100
and answer panel to ask me any questions

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,823
and we'll talk about them as
we go through this session.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,713
I wanna start

34
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:22,520
by introducing this idea
of the DevSec disconnect.

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,089
So for me, we're talking about developers,

36
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,670
we're talking about security,

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,460
there's definitely a
disconnection that exists.

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,880
There's some tension between
developers and security

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,440
regarding the security of
new features and bug fixes.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,050
And so let's talk about
this from the perspective

41
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,009
of the developer and then from security.

42
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,950
So as a developer,

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm sitting here thinking to myself

44
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,410
these security people, they're
always getting in the way,

45
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,770
they're always slowing me down,

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,420
they have arbitrary requirements,

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,100
they can't make up their mind,

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,710
we've got to push these new
features into production.

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,809
That's what drives us.

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,400
On the other side of the
coin, security is saying,

51
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,220
ah, these developers they're lazy,

52
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
they're not applying
the guidance we provided

53
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,300
in the security process and the pipeline,

54
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
their code is insecure,

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,820
and our tools always blow
up when we scan their code

56
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,269
'cause there's so many problems,

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,410
they can't push this
feature into production.

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,340
And so this is the DevSec disconnect.

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,720
There's this tension that exists

60
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,780
between developers and security.

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,330
It manifests itself

62
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,860
in various different
types of frustrations.

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,193
That's what I'm gonna
talk to you about today.

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,209
Now I wanted to stop
and make a quick point

65
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,960
because last year I came

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,280
to RSA Conference and I
talked about 10 things

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,050
I wish every developer
knew about security.

68
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,920
So last year I felt like
I was talking to security.

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,936
And one of my friends
challenged me and said,

70
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,510
"Why don't you flip this around

71
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,149
and think about this from
the developer's perspective?

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,210
Think about why developers are frustrated

73
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,980
with us as security people

74
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,530
and share that with the security community

75
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,280
so that they can understand
where the developers are coming

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,930
from and how they can better serve them,

77
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,680
how they can better help
them in the process."

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,240
So this year I'm talking about developers.

79
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,220
And so these two things together,

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,240
you can always go back

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,080
and look at the talk I did last year

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,223
to get more of a security
focus perspective.

83
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,160
So here's the 10
frustrations developers have

84
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,430
with security and right up front

85
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,660
I'd like to share these with you

86
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,243
so that you can see the
landscape for where we're going.

87
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,810
I counted them backwards.

88
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,290
I was trying to do a top 10 thing.

89
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,019
I don't know, but counting backwards.

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,690
Number 10 security tools are
loud, obnoxious and inaccurate.

91
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,609
Number nine, the sky is always falling,

92
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,770
we never celebrate success.

93
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,060
Remember, this is
developers speaking to us

94
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,410
as security people.

95
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,870
Security is busy work,

96
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,940
security is a silo and
they act as gatekeepers

97
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,310
and there's not enough time
in my development schedule

98
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,400
to do security.

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,423
There's the first five frustrations.

100
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,600
The final five, security
changes their mind all the time,

101
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,440
the security process is
difficult, it's undefined.

102
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't know why we put
so much effort and time

103
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,519
into security.

104
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,590
Nobody ever showed me how to security

105
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,460
and number one security
doesn't understand what I do

106
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,360
and doesn't know how to code.

107
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,170
Remember, these are the
frustrations that I've heard

108
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,790
as I've talked to developers
across the industry,

109
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,519
I've pulled different development
audiences across Twitter

110
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,480
and I've brought all of this
together and synthesized it

111
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,060
to help us understand
where we as security people

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,543
need to go to serve our developers better.

113
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,080
Developer empathy.

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,090
In its most simplest form,

115
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,299
we as security people

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,130
we need to walk a mile in
the shoes of our developers.

117
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,050
If you stop and think

118
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,660
for a second about what the
word empathy actually means,

119
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,480
it means vicarious experiencing
of the feelings, thoughts,

120
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,163
or attitudes of another.

121
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,503
In this case,

122
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm talking about security people

123
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,409
who are experiencing
the feelings, thoughts,

124
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,210
or attitudes of developers.

125
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,280
How are developers being
impacted by the security tools

126
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,510
and things that we put
into their pipelines

127
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,469
into their process?

128
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,290
And developer empathy,

129
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,930
it really happens when we as security

130
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,010
we walk that mile in
the developer's shoes.

131
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,900
We understand what are the real struggles

132
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,690
that they're challenged with.

133
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,620
Many of them are challenges
that we've presented to them,

134
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,453
what we've provided

135
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,119
through the way we've approached security.

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,940
And then embracing developer empathy.

137
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,440
It allows us as security

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,740
to experience those frustrations firsthand

139
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,910
from the eyes of our developers.

140
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,340
And that's really what's gonna help us

141
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,070
to change our approach,

142
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,150
change the way that we work

143
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,520
and interact with our developers.

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's jump right in and get into it.

145
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,950
So as a developer, frustration number one,

146
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,349
security doesn't understand what I do

147
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,400
and doesn't know how to code.

148
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,164
This is kind of an interesting one

149
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,560
'cause it's one of the more
controversial frustrations

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,393
that I listed here

151
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,590
and that's why I went
with it as number one.

152
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,423
And that is,

153
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,710
there is a big debate about

154
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,039
if you're gonna be in the
application security world,

155
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,053
if you're gonna be in DevSec ops

156
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,010
and you're a security person

157
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,693
how much do you need to
know about the actual code?

158
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,360
And I think you need to know a lot.

159
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,370
That's part of what the frustration is

160
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,500
that our developers are experiencing here.

161
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,220
Think about it from this perspective.

162
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,560
Let's imagine you take your
car in for service, okay?

163
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,500
Do you stand there next to the mechanic

164
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,560
and tell them how to fix the car?

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,810
No, because you don't know how
to fix the cars or the car.

166
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,350
If you could fix your own car,

167
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,850
you would fix the car at home.

168
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,683
You wouldn't have taken it

169
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,690
to the mechanic in the first place.

170
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,050
So it's frustrating

171
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,050
for developers to be coached
or governed or worked

172
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,890
with by folks that don't
understand what they actually do.

173
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,370
It's like you standing
next to the mechanic

174
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,480
telling them how to fix your car,

175
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,400
telling her how to fix your car.

176
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,950
So this is a frustrating thing.

177
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,610
And when you kind of think about it

178
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,880
from a summary statement perspective,

179
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,570
we as security, when
this frustration occurs,

180
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,010
we're looking at our developers
and at the end of the day

181
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,200
we're saying, you know,

182
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,253
I'm important enough to govern the process

183
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,930
that you're using,

184
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,453
I'm too busy to understand
the work that I govern.

185
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,100
And so for every frustration

186
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,670
we've got to have a resolution.

187
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,720
And so resolution number
one is become a developer

188
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,760
and learn how to code.

189
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,020
You must learn the primary
language and framework

190
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,270
of the developers that
you're trying to work with

191
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,659
as a security professional.

192
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,610
And yeah, I get it.

193
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,290
Not everybody is working

194
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,410
in application security
or product security.

195
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,575
If you're in information
security, I don't know,

196
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:30,099
maybe you don't need to learn how to code

197
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,030
but if you're gonna work
anywhere adjacent to developers,

198
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,559
you have to understand
the programming languages,

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
the constructs, the frameworks,

200
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,270
the things that they're using.

201
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,590
And let me tell you this,

202
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,640
the more you know about those languages,

203
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,340
your eyes are gonna open
in the code review process.

204
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,637
When you're looking at someone's code

205
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,480
and you start to have an understanding

206
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,100
for how code works and
how it all fits together,

207
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
you understand one
object-oriented language

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,603
and you can code review a lot of them.

209
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,429
The second thing is being able

210
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,800
to explain the build pipeline.

211
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,530
So as a security person,

212
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,719
if we're using this build pipeline

213
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,460
and that's what the developers are using

214
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,293
to build their code

215
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:11,900
and that's what we have our
security tools integrated into,

216
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,909
as a security person, you
better understand how it works.

217
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,420
I've heard too many stories

218
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,627
of different security people saying,

219
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,340
"Yeah, you know, our developers,

220
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,859
they use Azure DevOps as
the tool to build their code

221
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,280
and that's where we integrate
the security tools."

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,113
And I ask them like,

223
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,430
"Do you understand

224
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,797
that all the details of
how Azure DevOps works?"

225
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:31,920
"No, not really.

226
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,010
That's something that the
developers have to deal with."

227
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,900
Now, wrong answer.

228
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,169
That's something that you
as a security person need

229
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,689
to understand as well.

230
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,409
The third part, actually
write and commit code.

231
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,789
You wanna blow the developer's minds,

232
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,810
write some code and commit some code

233
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,880
into the thing that you're
trying to help them with.

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,140
With each of these, I've
got an empathy boost too.

235
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,300
So I want you to realize

236
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,209
as you intelligently advise developers

237
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,930
about the language and
framework specific issues,

238
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,699
you show them that you
care about their plight

239
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,790
because you've taken
the time to understand,

240
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,500
to learn the coding language,

241
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,130
learn the framework that they're using.

242
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,970
If you don't know how to do that,

243
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,870
check out Codecademy has
a great place to start

244
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,070
to learn a particular language
or a particular framework

245
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,870
at least enough to be
able to talk intelligently

246
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,920
with your developers.

247
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,650
Developers frustration number two

248
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,689
is nobody ever showed me how to security.

249
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,240
And so in your organization,

250
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,460
developer knowledge and
experience with security

251
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,383
may be lacking.

252
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,780
You as security may be expecting
your developers to react

253
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,640
and do the right thing
when they have no idea

254
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
what the right thing actually is.

255
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,730
And you haven't taken the
time to explain it to them.

256
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,230
This is the developer
looking at us and saying,

257
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,660
or us looking at them,

258
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,927
as security people,
looking at them and saying,

259
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,580
"Hey, do the right thing for
security and privacy, okay?"

260
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,230
Even though we haven't really taught you

261
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,890
what the right thing is.

262
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,257
Imagine going to your
development staff and saying,

263
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:57,089
"Hey, you know,

264
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,130
we've got a lot of SQL
injections that are happening

265
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,460
in our code, in our
applications right now,

266
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,520
we need to stop that.

267
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,766
And the developers look at you and say,

268
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,630
"What's a SQL injection," right?

269
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,550
That's the frustration,

270
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,380
nobody ever showed me how to security.

271
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,350
Well, resolution number two says,

272
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,373
build a security coaching
practice and an education program.

273
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,479
I had a chance to interview an individual

274
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,470
from a large financial.

275
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,020
And he was telling me

276
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,470
about how they had built this
security coaching practice

277
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,580
inside of their organization.

278
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,110
And the security coaching
practice was set up in such a way

279
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,310
that the members of the
application security team

280
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,150
would coach one-on-one

281
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,949
with various developers
across the organization.

282
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,730
And I thought to myself, wow,
that is a brilliant idea.

283
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,690
What a way to connect
with those developers

284
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,600
and walk shoulder to shoulder with them

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
as they're working through
various security issues

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,740
and being able to coach them.

287
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,790
So, one thing you got to do
here suggested path is define

288
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,290
and document how you're
gonna coach for security,

289
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,980
figure out how to build
that coaching function.

290
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,813
Number two,

291
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,390
empower your security team members

292
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,110
and your security champions
to perform coaching.

293
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,570
This is more than just
a central security team.

294
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,100
This is all your security champions.

295
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,480
They already love security,

296
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,900
empower them to go out
and coach other people,

297
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,890
encourage them to coach other developers.

298
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,723
And the third one,

299
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,829
roll out an education program

300
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,920
that touches every
product adjacent person.

301
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,610
When I say product adjacent,

302
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,520
you have a number of people
that surround whatever it is

303
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,353
that you build.

304
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,449
There's developers, there's testers,

305
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,800
there's site reliability engineers,

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,689
there's product managers,
there's program managers,

307
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,350
people managers, directors, executives,

308
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,120
anybody who is adjacent to the product

309
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,960
needs an education in security.

310
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,350
They don't all need the same lessons,

311
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,340
they don't all need the
same specific things,

312
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,770
but they each need lessons
that are applicable

313
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,780
to what their role is.

314
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,220
Here's an empathy boost for you.

315
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,910
Listen to the developers all the time,

316
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,079
ask them for feedback about
what they need help with

317
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,963
and build solutions to
teach and coach them.

318
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,530
Frustration number three is,

319
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,189
I don't know why we put so much effort

320
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,160
and time into security.

321
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,557
This is your developer
talking to you and saying,

322
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,270
"Why do we do all this security stuff?

323
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,800
Why do we have to do all this?"

324
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,099
And when you think about how
developers are compensated,

325
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,190
that'll help you to understand
why they ask this question.

326
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,500
In the average organization,

327
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,940
developers are compensated and bonused,

328
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,380
according to the number of
features that they can produce.

329
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,740
Number of bugs that they can fix.

330
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,020
And we as a security team,

331
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,776
were rightfully telling them all the time,

332
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,780
"Hey, there is a need and there is value

333
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,199
in building secure things."

334
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,460
But what we forget to
do is we forget to share

335
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,280
the value proposition with them,

336
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,810
the return on investment,

337
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,979
for the work that they're
gonna do to secure new features

338
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,360
from the start, shifting left,

339
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,040
and also the rework savings
that are gonna be generated.

340
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,120
So it's more than just securing
new features from the start.

341
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,420
That's super important.

342
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,260
We want to shift left in
our approach to security

343
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,580
and start doing security
as early as possible.

344
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,120
But the other thing that we always forget

345
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,360
to lean into is there is a rework savings.

346
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,110
Every security issue we could
eliminate left in the process

347
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,310
means less rework after
something goes to production,

348
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,270
And developers don't like doing rework.

349
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,569
I don't think anybody likes doing rework

350
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,210
but I know developers, especially
don't like doing rework.

351
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,160
And so that's something that
we got to lean into here.

352
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,430
So resolution number three is,

353
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,770
start with why and security ROI.

354
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,850
Starting with why security
is a very important idea.

355
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,290
And I didn't come up with this.

356
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,630
Simon Sinek wrote a book
called "Start With Why"

357
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,960
I read this book and I thought,

358
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,573
huh, that's pretty interesting.

359
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,650
And what he talks about
is how we always jump

360
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,270
into the what and the how,

361
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,067
when we're taking something
to someone and say,

362
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,400
"You need to do this."

363
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,597
We don't step back and say,

364
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:45,210
"here's why you need to do that."

365
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,630
And that's what I'm recommending here.

366
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,530
Start with why,

367
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,220
start launching a campaign

368
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,010
to help those product
adjacent folks understand

369
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,620
why security is important
for your customers,

370
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,990
not for you as a security
team, not for your executives,

371
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,810
not for some other group
inside of your company,

372
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,719
position this through the
eyes of your customers.

373
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,280
Because when I think
about how customers think

374
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,439
about security these days, it's three R's.

375
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,660
It's reputation, it's
retention, it's requirement.

376
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,057
Reputation meaning your customer
is looking at you going,

377
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:18,550
"Is this a company that takes
security seriously or not?

378
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,410
'Cause if they don't,

379
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,699
I don't really know
that I want to continue

380
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,620
to work with them," which is retention.

381
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,912
So if you don't have that,

382
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,130
if you don't have that
approach to security,

383
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,350
your customers are gonna
be looking to go elsewhere.

384
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,450
And the last R there, is just requirement.

385
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,630
A lot of customers have
specific requirements.

386
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,630
They send you this long
list of requirements

387
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,200
when they want you to become a new vendor,

388
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,770
all of this because they are
so serious about security.

389
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,660
Second part of this is
provide real metrics

390
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,719
for security return on investment.

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,730
Analyze the data,

392
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,050
provide real metrics for
the return on investment

393
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,829
for security that your
developers are experiencing.

394
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,820
I'll throw a metric out here.

395
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,940
We got to throw and I mentioned
I can't just walk away

396
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,250
and not give you an actual
metric to work from here.

397
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,520
Start to calculate the percentage of flaws

398
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,350
that require rework because
of some security deficiency,

399
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,810
whether that's a tool finding,

400
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,660
whether that's a code review finding,

401
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,030
irregardless of where it comes from.

402
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,240
Start to track that number.

403
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,910
Start to look at that metric

404
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,170
and start to balance it
and try to build a case

405
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,900
around the return on
investment for security.

406
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,050
The more things we fix
early in the process,

407
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,310
the less rework we have to do,

408
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,910
the more new cool features that
we can build as developers.

409
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,033
You got to sell this.

410
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,850
And our empathy boosts on this one

411
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,360
is when we open the door for developers

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,800
to understand why we do what we do,

413
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,166
they're gonna get on board and say,

414
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,390
"I'm with you.

415
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm onboard with our mission
to secure the planet,"

416
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,050
whatever the planet means for you.

417
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,069
Frustration number four,

418
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,393
the security process is
difficult or undefined.

419
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,210
Without guidance and a framework,

420
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,720
developers just don't know
what we want them to do.

421
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,040
They don't know what the requirements are,

422
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,939
they don't know what the expectations are

423
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,750
for new feature development.

424
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,570
Going back to the previous thing I said,

425
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,200
they're compensated in bonus based

426
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,600
on being able to complete
features, fix bugs.

427
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,470
And if you don't give them clear guidance,

428
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,390
they don't know how that impacts
what they're trying to do.

429
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,390
Developers, they crave
predictability of the process.

430
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,400
If you are operating a semi
out-of-control process,

431
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,100
then you're messing
with their whole world,

432
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,260
you're messing with their
whole flow as developers

433
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,170
because they don't know what to expect.

434
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,160
And if you don't have that
predictability of the process

435
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,170
it's just difficult and frustrating

436
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,250
to gauge how much time
they need to set aside

437
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,500
to do the security process related items

438
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,370
we're asking them to do.

439
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,547
And if you're marching towards
a Friday deadline where,

440
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,320
"Hey, I have to have
these three things done

441
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
for this sprint,"

442
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,070
you need predictability.

443
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,290
So that's the frustration
they have here is that,

444
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,560
often we forget about predictability.

445
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,180
We tell them, follow the security process.

446
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,723
You know, the 100-page
document on the Wiki.

447
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,100
So resolution number four here is,

448
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,680
use the secure development
life cycle as guard rails.

449
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,689
So when I think about guard rails

450
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,830
I think about a car going up a mountain.

451
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,280
We have guardrails there
on both sides of the road

452
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,180
to keep us from going off
the side of the mountain,

453
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,540
to protect us.

454
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,329
But what the guard rails
don't do is they're not

455
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,339
just two inches wider than your car.

456
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,139
So you really can't maneuver a whole lot.

457
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,400
You got to stay really close

458
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,040
and really tight to the right spot.

459
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,190
Guardrails give you some freedom

460
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,839
around the security process

461
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,443
to have some creativity and
lean into what you have to do.

462
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,980
And so leaning into your
secure development life cycle

463
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,860
like it's 2021, you better
have an SDL at this point.

464
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,530
SDL is table stakes, secure
development life cycle.

465
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,379
If you don't have one, get one quick.

466
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,170
The other thing is just set expectations,

467
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,670
define and communicate the
clear developer expectations

468
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,180
regarding the security
development life cycle

469
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,650
and any other security processes.

470
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,530
Remember the guardrails,

471
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,360
they keep that car from going
off the side of the mountain,

472
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,370
they assist the developer

473
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,750
on how they can stay in the security lane

474
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,223
and still do things a
little bit more creatively.

475
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,250
Frustration number five.

476
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,150
And this one, this just burns me

477
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,510
when I heard this from a
couple of different people

478
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,400
and as I've continued to think about it.

479
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,853
Security changes their minds all the time.

480
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,980
And so you'll hear this sometimes where,

481
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,227
a developer will say,

482
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:11,710
"Okay, when security was
working with Jane's team,

483
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,820
they said X.

484
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,889
And when they spoke with
our team, they said, Y,

485
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,723
what gives,

486
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:18,000
how can there be two different answers

487
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,457
to what seems like it's
the same exact question?"

488
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,230
When you think about it, though,

489
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,250
depending on the knowledge level

490
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,720
of the people who are
listening to the answer,

491
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,200
both answers may have been correct.

492
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,160
The frustration, that's
not about accuracy,

493
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
it's about the trust that
the development teams have

494
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,090
with the security people
that are advising them.

495
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,070
Developers, they're looking
for clear, concise guidance,

496
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,520
on what security wants them to do.

497
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,550
Just tell me what you
want me to do clearly.

498
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,639
And they experience frustration

499
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,570
when we lose that process predictability,

500
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,909
it lose faith in the advices source

501
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,690
if it's not consistent.

502
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,140
And if a developer loses faith

503
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,650
in security's capabilities
for many reasons,

504
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,050
they're gonna avoid bringing
things to your attention.

505
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,480
They're gonna just say, "well,

506
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,050
we'll just do this one without
any advice from security"

507
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,470
which we all know what's
gonna happen there.

508
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,820
And we don't want that.

509
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,423
We want to be trusted advisors.

510
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,850
This is security saying,

511
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,560
we don't change our minds,
we re-interpret the data.

512
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,980
Yeah. Sometimes we change our mind.

513
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,280
Sometimes we get it wrong.

514
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,880
And so resolution number
five is gain understanding

515
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,400
and offer a second opinion.

516
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,740
You have to search for understanding.

517
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,680
And I realized this is gonna
grind some security people,

518
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,450
it's gonna make them a little
bit angry and that's okay,

519
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,080
I don't really care.

520
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,256
This attitude of us as
security people saying,

521
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,320
"I'm always right.

522
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,159
I'm from security.

523
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,690
This is my discipline.
I have all the answers."

524
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,115
No.

525
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,690
That's not how we work
in a collaborative world.

526
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,010
We can't just continue to believe

527
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,120
that we have all the answers

528
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,810
and nobody else can offer
anything to help us.

529
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,570
So you got to search
for understanding here

530
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,879
when you're working with these developers.

531
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,380
You have to search for
and question understanding

532
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,510
in any of the interactions
that you have with them.

533
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,970
You have to ensure that your team

534
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,800
is giving out the same guidance,

535
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,943
at least at a high-level perspective,

536
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,780
because there's nothing worse than

537
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,930
if that example I gave was true

538
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,220
where one security person
is talking to team X

539
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,680
and they're giving one set of advice

540
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,380
and somebody else is talking to team Y

541
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,210
and they're given a completely
different set of advice.

542
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,510
That's really frustrating.

543
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,050
Another thing that's gonna
scare some people here,

544
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,730
provide a mechanism for developers
to get a second opinion.

545
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,810
I mean, in the world of medicine,

546
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,330
we get a second opinion
all the time, right?

547
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,750
We get a doctor tells us something

548
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,990
we're like, "Oh, I don't like that answer.

549
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,460
I'm gonna go get a second opinion."

550
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,293
Now I get it.

551
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,699
We don't wanna create this world where

552
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,020
there's this whole distrust

553
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,560
and nobody thinks they
can believe anything

554
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,393
anybody's saying,

555
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,230
but as security people

556
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,427
we have to be willing
to once in a while say,

557
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:42,260
"You know what?

558
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,093
You might need a second opinion.

559
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,160
Let me bring in one of my colleagues,

560
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,710
bounce this idea off from them

561
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,820
and let's see what they
conclude coming out of this."

562
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,700
And here's the empathy boost for this one.

563
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,533
Once again,

564
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,419
this is gonna scare a lot of people

565
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,210
but if you're wrong, admit it and move on.

566
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,500
Nothing builds trust

567
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,977
like a person who's willing to accept,

568
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:00,160
"Hey, you know what?

569
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,993
I'm not perfect.

570
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,720
I don't have all the answers all the time.

571
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm trying to do my best

572
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,680
to help you build the most secure product

573
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
that's gonna serve our customers well

574
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,220
and protect our customer's data,

575
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,212
but I don't have all the answers."

576
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:13,930
Just that little move
right there can be enough

577
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,283
to really build and gain some trust.

578
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,890
Frustration number six from
the developer's perspective is,

579
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,993
I don't have enough time to do security.

580
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,850
And we all know the old adage, right?

581
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,870
Fast, cheap, good,

582
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,862
you can have any two or three
that you want off that list.

583
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,090
But developers experience
pressure every day,

584
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,780
tied to the amount of resources
they've been allocated

585
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,310
to do their job.

586
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,330
And when we live in a world
where resourcing is confusing

587
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,590
and we don't know if security

588
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,199
has been given the right
mandate, the right resource,

589
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,940
the right allocation of time,

590
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,600
all this does is build frustration,

591
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,040
and it does it to the developers.

592
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,290
It's not really us that
even feels that pain.

593
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,449
When a developer has a
manager that hasn't bought

594
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,560
into whatever the corporate
requirements are gonna be

595
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,520
for security, then the developer,

596
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,562
to do what's right for
security has to push against

597
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,770
their manager.

598
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,780
And to comply with what
security is the degree

599
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,600
they have to go against them.

600
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,629
And that's not healthy.

601
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,220
That's not good.

602
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,500
And so I think about, you know,

603
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,080
what if development
flipped back around on us

604
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,016
from a security perspective and said,

605
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:16,968
"Hey, you know what?

606
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,180
You've got 10 minutes to
perform this code review.

607
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,230
You've got 15 minutes to do
that threat model right there."

608
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,130
Like that pressure and not
having that time allocated

609
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,120
in that resource would be
a struggle for us as well.

610
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
So frustration number six is
not enough time to do security.

611
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,210
The resolution here is we
have to raise awareness

612
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,810
about security resource needs.

613
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,010
We have to get buy-in at all levels.

614
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,500
When I say all levels I mean,

615
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,170
frontline managers, directors, executives,

616
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,910
everybody has to buy in

617
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,320
to what we're asking each developer to do

618
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,710
in regards to security
in our DevOps pipeline.

619
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,950
We also have to provide estimates

620
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,690
for how much time these
activities are gonna take.

621
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,550
We've got to create some metrics.

622
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,490
We've got to track these activities

623
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,167
so that we can better advise
our constituents and say,

624
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,669
"Hey, here is the amount

625
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,640
of time we really need to allocate."

626
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,150
And I'm gonna call on everybody,

627
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,590
launch a campaign to make everyone aware

628
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,003
across your company,

629
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,560
what the security resource
needs actually are.

630
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,000
And what are the times that
are involved with this.

631
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,720
And from an empathy boost perspective,

632
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,320
as developers start to receive
this management support

633
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,649
that they need,

634
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,820
the happier and more productive
they're gonna be with you

635
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,300
as a security team,

636
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,340
because they're not fighting
against their own management.

637
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,629
It's been allocated at
the organizational level

638
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,410
that we have to allocate time

639
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,360
to do the right things for
security in our DevOps pipeline.

640
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,940
Frustration number seven
is security is a silo

641
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,943
and acts as a gatekeeper.

642
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,540
In the world of DevOps,

643
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,659
we promote open communication
amongst everyone on the team,

644
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,398
we say, we cannot have a
bunch of different silos

645
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,510
that are bumping into each other,

646
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,480
that are separated and
doing their own thing.

647
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,740
When we have that type
of a siloed environment

648
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,920
we know that the feedback
is gonna be slow.

649
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,480
We're not gonna share information,

650
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,100
friction is gonna be high,

651
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,649
everybody's gonna be miserable.

652
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,150
The classic security answer
to DevOps is to say that

653
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,010
we live in this security silo

654
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,840
and we have all the
knowledge and experience

655
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,240
and we get to make all the decisions.

656
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,340
So, you know, if you need
something, just let us know,

657
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,290
but we're just gonna stay
here and guard this gate

658
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,570
as a gatekeeper right here.

659
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,149
This is nothing but frustration though,

660
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,820
for developers in a DevOps world,

661
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,560
because we wanna move fast.

662
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,970
We want to get stuff done,

663
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,460
and we want to get out of the way

664
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,050
and just be able to do stuff.

665
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,060
And so gatekeepers are
gonna be frustrating

666
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,100
because they try to control the process,

667
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,330
they try to slow
everything down to a crawl.

668
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,500
This is DevOps,

669
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,730
we're doing DevOps in security

670
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,490
we've got to do this at
a high rate of speed.

671
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,420
So we don't wanna be a gatekeeper.

672
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,980
We don't want people to
gatekeep against us as security.

673
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,010
Imagine if this got flipped back around

674
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,260
and the gatekeeping was happening
on the development side,

675
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,970
and they said, "Hey, you know what?

676
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,190
We're not gonna run that
static analysis tool.

677
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,350
Yeah, we'll have it in two
weeks, but we're just gonna,

678
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,469
we're gonna slow this thing down

679
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,830
'cause we got a lot of cool
code to push to production.

680
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,050
So we're gonna do that later."

681
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,570
That would never pass
from our perspective.

682
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,720
All I'm doing is flipping it back around

683
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,580
and changing the perspective
to make us the people

684
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,899
who are receiving the bad
news from our perspective.

685
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,600
So resolution number seven,
it's all about partnership.

686
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,810
We got to partner with
the development teams.

687
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,490
We got to let go.

688
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,220
We have to build an automated
process that takes security,

689
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,900
integrates it into DevOps,

690
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,750
we test it, we validate it,

691
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,717
we make sure we're happy with it,

692
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:35,870
and then we let it go and
we let it do its thing,

693
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,800
we don't try to keep
sticking our nose into it

694
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,770
and trying to gatekeep.

695
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,660
We don't wanna do that.

696
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,140
All that does is slow things
down and make everybody angry.

697
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,760
We wanna perform a
proper assessment to ask,

698
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,160
are we gatekeeping?

699
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,840
Do we have some of these bad habits?

700
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,486
Ask your development audiences

701
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:57,420
"Hey, is there any hint that
we're gatekeeping here?"

702
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,800
Like that's a tough question to ask.

703
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,090
You have to be very vulnerable
to be able to ask that

704
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,340
but that's what true developer,
security, connection,

705
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,429
collaboration, communication is all about.

706
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,440
Partner with the developers.

707
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,070
They wanna work with us.

708
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,179
They really do.

709
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,690
And by treating them as partners,

710
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,490
they'll look for
opportunities to reciprocate.

711
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,323
They'll look for opportunities

712
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,110
to bring us in to conversations

713
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,530
where things need
additional security help.

714
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,950
Frustration number eight for developers

715
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,300
is security busy work.

716
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,980
Developers need to see
the value in any activity

717
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,700
that we're asking them to do.

718
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,590
And so if you require a risk assessment

719
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,179
or a threat model for every new feature

720
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,420
and then you take that and
you just file it somewhere

721
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,850
and nobody looks at it, you're
wasting everyone's time.

722
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,230
You're wasting developers' time,

723
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,120
you're wasting your time,

724
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,709
you're wasting the resources
of the cloud service

725
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,330
where you're copying the
risk assessment team.

726
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,572
That's how passionate I am about
not wasting anybody's time.

727
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,960
And if you're doing anything
manually in your process,

728
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,290
you're wasting some time as well.

729
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,409
Well, except for threat modeling.

730
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,243
But we do that,

731
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,560
it's a little bit more
of a manual operation

732
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,800
in a DevOps world.

733
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,633
But it's frustrating

734
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,960
for anyone to have to do
busy work of any type.

735
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,240
I mean, we, as security people,

736
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,740
we don't like doing busy work.

737
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,890
But then as a security person

738
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,890
we might sometimes respond with busy work.

739
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,280
How can you call writing
a 100-page document

740
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,010
about security architecture, busy work?

741
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,430
We may think that's fun.

742
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,150
Not necessarily every developer's gonna

743
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,690
have the same conclusion that that's fun.

744
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,780
So how do we resolve this
when we optimize the process

745
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,030
and we make a no busy work rule.

746
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,863
And with this,

747
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,020
we have to review the artifacts value.

748
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,600
Everything that we're
collecting in our process,

749
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,020
we have to determine is this
adding value to the product,

750
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,090
to the application, to whatever
it is that we're building?

751
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,677
Collect feedback from developers to say,

752
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,750
"Hey, what's the value you're
getting on this survey?"

753
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,717
Your developers to say,

754
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,140
"Hey, with that new
process for risk assessment

755
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,973
we went through,

756
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:50,520
what would you say on a scale
of one to 10 is the value?

757
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,030
What are some things you liked?

758
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,660
What are some things you would
change about that process?

759
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,210
Imagine the feedback you'll
get coming out of that.

760
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,250
Then we have to be ready
to cancel any artifacts

761
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,670
in our process that we
determine through communication

762
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,920
with our developers,

763
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,210
that they're not useful

764
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,210
for the improvement of
security and or privacy.

765
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,566
If they're not, get them out of here.

766
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,700
The empathy boost here is just thinking

767
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,940
about the fact that, "Hey, you know,

768
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,950
you don't like to do
busy work in your job,

769
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,560
neither do your developers.

770
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,010
Provide them with
security and privacy work

771
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,637
that's meaningful to them and has value."

772
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,133
Right?

773
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,790
Frustration number nine,
the sky is always falling,

774
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,963
we never celebrate success.

775
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,060
As security people we're not
known for our positivity.

776
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,893
We're just not.

777
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,159
Because our job is to chase
the next vulnerability,

778
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,860
the next problem, the next bug,

779
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,800
we seldom stop to celebrate
and pat anybody on the back

780
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,633
and say, "Hey,

781
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:53,120
that was a really nice job
that you just did there."

782
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,780
And so in this environment where we live,

783
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,970
it can always appear
that the sky is falling

784
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,070
and things are getting worse all the time.

785
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,750
But it's frustrating for a developer

786
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,850
to work in that environment

787
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,780
where they feel like
they have this perception

788
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,470
where nothing is getting
better, nothing's getting done.

789
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,360
Why am I continuing to do these
things over and over again

790
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,120
and there doesn't appear
to be any different result?

791
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,110
It's also frustrating to always constantly

792
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,449
be negatively communicated
with about security bugs,

793
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,203
with no hint or no success
ever being celebrated.

794
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,447
As security people were gonna say,

795
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,600
"Hey, we would celebrate,

796
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800
but we just got a page
for another incident.

797
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,950
It's not an excuse.

798
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,163
Resolution number nine is to
celebrate our security wins.

799
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,587
It's not that difficult of a thing to do,

800
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:42,420
but the first thing you got to do

801
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,957
is you got to get a feel for,

802
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:46,943
"Hey, are we doing this at all right now?

803
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:50,290
Do our developers think that
the sky is always falling?

804
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,389
Is that how they're perceiving us?

805
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,880
Is it us as security people

806
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,350
that are causing this perception?"

807
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,540
And then get ready to
celebrate at all levels.

808
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,270
And there's a million
ways you can do this.

809
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,730
Some that cost money, some that don't,

810
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,770
you can send an email or a team chat

811
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,770
to a group of people or an
individual that's in a chat,

812
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,380
you know, in their,

813
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,527
a chat for their particular group to say,

814
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:16,610
"Hey, I just saw you do something cool,

815
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,929
and I just want to let the
whole group know about this,

816
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,090
or you really fixed that security bug

817
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,490
that we brought to your attention quickly,

818
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,300
you did it thoroughly, I did
a code review and I was like,

819
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,560
wow, that was a nice fix right there

820
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,537
to eliminate this security problem."

821
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,970
Those types of things
don't cost you anything.

822
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,370
A little bit of time, sure.
But they don't cost any money.

823
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,520
Look for other places to
celebrate your security wins.

824
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,060
Whether that's a group all hands,

825
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,270
whether that's creating

826
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,530
a program called the
security win of the month

827
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,020
where you're picking something
that happened once a month

828
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,877
and sending out an email
or something that says,

829
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:51,480
"Hey, this really cool thing happened."

830
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,810
By celebrating security wins,

831
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,379
we can make things better
for our developers.

832
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,630
When you work on a team
that values these things,

833
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,590
it just makes you look

834
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,300
for other opportunities to do stuff

835
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,899
to improve security and privacy.

836
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,200
Frustration number 10,

837
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,120
security tools are loud,
obnoxious, and inaccurate.

838
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,810
As security people, we love our tools.

839
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,800
We think they have all the answers for us.

840
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,649
Guess what, they don't.

841
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,483
They're good.

842
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:16,350
They're useful.

843
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,639
They're things that we want
to ensure that we include

844
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,820
but they're not the end-all and be-all.

845
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,200
And developers are
frustrated when we send them

846
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,430
the results of a tool

847
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,090
that generates 10,000 entries.

848
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,220
What are they supposed to do with that?

849
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,350
How are they gonna deal with
10,000 individual items?

850
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,870
And so they're frustrated
also when tools provide

851
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,439
false positives left and right.

852
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,523
And so this is us a security asking them,

853
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,629
"well, can you just
address all the problems

854
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,720
the tool reported?

855
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,817
By yesterday?"

856
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,990
It's frustrating to have a tool

857
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,300
that's loud, obnoxious, and inaccurate.

858
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,870
Resolution number 10 is to tune the tools.

859
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,219
Assess tool angst.

860
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,556
Are there tools that people,

861
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:56,450
developers are just super frustrated with,

862
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,890
that are in your pipeline?

863
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,930
Do you even know that answer
to that question right now?

864
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,950
You should.

865
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,480
You've got to ask people,
you got to survey,

866
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,530
you got to see how are our
tools supporting our customer.

867
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,363
Security,

868
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:10,010
our customer is the
developer in the pipeline.

869
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,655
We're not the overseer gatekeeper.

870
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,379
We're a partner slash they're our customer

871
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,960
when it comes to the
tools that we provide.

872
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,170
Practice the least
possible configuration mode

873
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,710
when the new tools or tools
that have a terrible reputation

874
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,930
change that configuration.

875
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,260
If it's generating a bunch of noise,

876
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,900
pick the top thing

877
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,520
that's a problem for your
organization and then use that,

878
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,430
set the policy to look for that one thing.

879
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,333
Build some trust in that tool.

880
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,080
And the last one here is
don't be afraid to yank a tool

881
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
of your pipeline.

882
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,200
Dismiss the underperforming tools.

883
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,177
People have this idea where like,

884
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:44,830
"Oh, I spent all this money on this tool.

885
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,480
I could never pull it
out of the pipeline."

886
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,313
Guess what?

887
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:51,560
If it's terrible, rip it out,
send it back, demand a refund,

888
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,139
pick something else that's best of breed

889
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,990
in that particular class
of tool and move on.

890
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,590
But don't let underperforming
tools hang around

891
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,893
and cause angst amongst
your development staff.

892
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,800
Properly tune the tools,

893
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,680
that provides security and
privacy value for developers,

894
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,860
for you is security

895
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,350
and at the end of the
day for your customer.

896
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,969
So here's the summary of the
10 resolutions that I had.

897
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,450
It starts with tuning the tools.

898
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,670
So we're gonna work our way backwards

899
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,180
make sure that you're
tuning the tools such a way

900
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,280
is that they add value.

901
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,870
Celebrate those wins security.

902
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,159
Look for an opportunity

903
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,597
to pat a developer on the back and say,

904
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:26,570
"Hey, nice job.

905
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,980
That was a great fix you had there."

906
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,860
Optimize the process and
we don't allow busy work.

907
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,010
We wanna be partners.

908
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,850
There's no gate-keeping allowed.

909
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,070
We wanna raise awareness
about security resource needs

910
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,419
so nobody feels that pressure
to argue with their manager

911
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,570
about doing what we're saying
they should do for security.

912
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,450
Gain that understanding
of your developers,

913
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,680
offer a second opinion if you need to,

914
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,270
use the SDL as a guardrail

915
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,170
to keep them within a boundary

916
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,400
but not lock them into
exactly what they have to do.

917
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,390
Make sure the developers understand why,

918
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,070
build that coaching practice,
that educational program,

919
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,730
and most important,

920
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,300
become a developer and learn how to code.

921
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,133
You can do it.

922
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,830
Last thing I wanna leave you
with here is just remember,

923
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,110
we talked at the beginning
about developer empathy,

924
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,250
practice that.

925
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,000
Developers have empathy for security.

926
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
Security for operations,
operations for development,

927
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,460
everybody for everybody,

928
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,679
everybody's got to practice empathy.

929
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,179
And so here's my "Apply" slide for you.

930
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,960
Next week, you should find
a developer to job shadow

931
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,210
for at least a week and
practice developer empathy

932
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,449
with them directly.

933
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,839
Work side-by-side with
them, shoulder to shoulder,

934
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,610
ask a million questions

935
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,000
and understand what they do and the pain

936
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
the frustrations that
they are experiencing.

937
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,510
And then evaluate the
general frustration level

938
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,080
within your organization.

939
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,259
Within the first three months,

940
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,080
find at least one
developer to partner with

941
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,913
on these efforts.

942
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,476
You can't just look down
from the mountain and say,

943
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:48,549
"Well, I went to this talk at RSA

944
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,909
and now I know all these resolutions.

945
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm just gonna start
throwing these things out

946
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,110
for everybody to absorb."

947
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,139
No, find some developers and
practice developer empathy,

948
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,670
and partner with them

949
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,110
so that they know that they're
important in this process

950
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,580
and that you wanna work with them.

951
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,759
Assess your organization
against the 10 frustrations,

952
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,593
build a list,

953
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:06,950
you can't fix them all at the same time.

954
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,089
Within six months you should
deploy multiple resolutions

955
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,900
to improve your security culture

956
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,410
'cause at the end of the day,
that's what it's all about.

957
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,500
So in conclusion,

958
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
the DevSec disconnect,

959
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,466
I talked about that
tension between developers

960
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,130
and security regarding the security

961
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,850
of new features and bug fixes.

962
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,670
I talked a lot about developer empathy.

963
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,060
I'm gonna say it again.

964
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,710
Developer empathy is when
security walks a mile

965
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,020
in the developer shoes

966
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,250
understanding the struggles
that your developers have

967
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,650
with implementing
security, pushing features,

968
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,890
doing bug fixes, understand
where they're coming from.

969
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,609
Find that developer to job shadow,

970
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,030
your eyes will be open so
much wider than they are today

971
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,830
and practice that developer
empathy with them directly.

972
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,663
The last part,

973
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:48,940
build a programmatic approach

974
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,730
to understand these frustrations
and apply the resolutions.

975
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,500
These things will work for you

976
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,650
but you got to understand
where the true frustrations lie

977
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,270
and how to take these resolutions

978
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,440
and put them together into
a programmatic approach.

979
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,687
Thank you very much for
listening for this conversation.
