1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,000
- Hi, my name is Kerry Matre

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,850
and I'm here today with John Caimano.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,940
Today we're gonna talk
about why your metrics suck.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,490
And I know that's a bit abrupt.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,770
Everybody knows that security
is a serious business

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,720
but John and I have spent
about 20 years each in security

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,150
and people are always
asking about metrics,

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,450
complaining about metrics.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,100
And what we've noticed
over the past 20 years

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,920
is that there's good metrics
and very, very bad ones.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,210
So we don't know your environments

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,340
we don't know what tools
are available to you

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,040
but what we'd like to do today is talk

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,970
about what makes a good
metric, give you some examples

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,420
of good metrics and
keep it kind of informal

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,020
and share some stories with
you from our experience.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,430
So what I wanna start off
with is just level setting

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,623
on what is reporting and what is metrics.

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,800
So you can think of reporting

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,739
as just activity or reporting on activity.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,150
Reporting is things like
number of incidents handled

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,310
maybe number of high
severity incidents handled,

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,060
number of analysts working in the stock

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,500
or hours that they worked that week.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Reporting, reports on activity

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,773
but doesn't drive change.

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,210
Metrics on the other hands

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,339
these can guide the business.

29
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,690
Metrics are things that can tell you

30
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,053
what's the next action
that needs to be taken.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,610
Is your business doing well?

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,870
Are your operations set up
to protect your business

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,640
or is there some change
that needs to be made?

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,970
So reporting is activity

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,929
and metrics is something that
can actually drive an activity

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,043
in your organization.

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,360
And that's the key points
that we wanna get across

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,870
it's metrics that matter

39
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,700
provide confidence and drive change.

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,080
And this is something that

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,309
our friend Treat contributed

42
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:58,380
to the book that we wrote
together called Elements

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,259
of Security Operations that
John and I put together.

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,770
But what this means is
that metrics need to

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,609
provide the business
confidence that you were

46
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,240
providing the service
that you say you're gonna

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,230
or if they shouldn't be confident

48
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,959
you need to be truthful about that too.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,850
So the business knows
your starting points.

50
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,683
The other thing is

51
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:21,570
that they can't just be
numbers that are flashed

52
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,420
on the screen.

53
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,350
That doesn't mean anything to someone.

54
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,940
So the metrics that you provide
need to actually provide

55
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,543
or drive change in the business.

56
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,770
Now, one of the things
that I wanna talk about is

57
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,380
sometimes people are afraid of metrics.

58
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,640
They were afraid of the stories that they

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
might uncover.

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,600
They're afraid that metrics
might make somebody look bad.

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,733
A lot of times metrics are
kind of hard to gather.

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,519
Sometimes they just
lead to more questions.

63
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,520
So what I wanna help you
understand is that don't

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,859
be afraid of metrics,
they might get in the way

65
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,520
of a story being told

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,770
but what that tells you
is that that story is not

67
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,050
one that needs to be told.

68
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,690
The business needs to know the truth,

69
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,843
they need to get that confidence.

70
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,500
And so don't be afraid
of metrics, just provide

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,850
that truth to the business.

72
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,209
- Kerry I'd like to add onto that.

73
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,650
- Absolutely.

74
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,210
- So I have a personal story
on this in my personal life

75
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,860
not even inside of security
operations, but my wife and I

76
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,210
we have four children and
at one point in our lives

77
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,010
they were very little and they're young.

78
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,420
And we hired a house
cleaning service to help keep

79
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,570
up with the house cleaning

80
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,100
and keep our house right and clean.

81
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,493
And over the time that we had them,

82
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,709
they were keeping our house clean,

83
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,100
It was superb.

84
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,933
It was great.

85
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,420
And because we weren't measuring any kind

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,899
of metrics or looking for any reports

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,120
on how well they were doing
as keeping our house clean

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,700
we started, my wife and I
started getting a false sense

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,459
of security that we were
doing a really knock

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,829
up job that we were actually
keeping the house clean

91
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,529
on her own and that everything was fine.

92
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,450
So we wound up letting go
of the housekeeping staff

93
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,070
to no longer come in and
weekly do a cleaning.

94
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,650
And we learned quickly that
the housecleaning staff

95
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,760
was actually the service
was actually doing the job

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,480
and was keeping our house clean for us.

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,010
And as soon as we let go of that,

98
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,829
our house became a mess again
and we quickly had to re hire.

99
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:47,040
This is why in security operations

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,820
it's supremely important that we go ahead

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,210
and collect those right
metrics and reports

102
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,620
because if you don't, you're
gonna wind up with a mess

103
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,060
inside of your network and
inside of your operations.

104
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,740
And at that point

105
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,190
unlike us who it was
just a couple extra bucks

106
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,610
for us to get the staff back
out here and start cleaning

107
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,220
and maybe an extra cleaning

108
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,580
or two before we were back on track

109
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,180
if you mess up and security
operations, you're talking

110
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,720
about a breach, some kind
of ransoming, destruction

111
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,480
or exfiltration of data.

112
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,900
And at that point you're losing
confidence in the market,

113
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,539
you're losing confidence
in your product and

114
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,040
that reputation damage
can be irreversible.

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,990
So it's really important
that when we're talking

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,265
about security operations,
that we do collect

117
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:36,320
those right reports
and those right metrics

118
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,990
so that way we know
exactly what's going on

119
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,350
and we don't wind up cutting back in areas

120
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,000
because we have this false
sense that we're doing great

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,130
and we don't need to spend as much

122
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,283
in this area as we have before.

123
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,500
- Yeah.

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,750
there's two reasons why security

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,480
organizations are quiet.

126
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,210
Things are going really,
really well or things

127
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,099
are going really, really poorly.

128
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,220
So you wanna make sure that
you provide those metrics

129
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,156
to the business.

130
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,300
Again, security
organizations are providing

131
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,840
a service to the business.

132
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,739
The business needs to understand
how that service is going,

133
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,400
are they getting the value from it.

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,250
So again, metrics that
matter, provide confidence

135
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,410
and drive change.

136
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,440
We'll say that about 20
more times before the end

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,313
of the other session here.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,296
So now we'll jump to this.

139
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,880
I mean, we pick on MTTR,

140
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,110
we even picked on MTTR and the title.

141
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,083
So John, why don't you
take us through why?

142
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,310
- Mean Time to Resolution

143
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,730
it's one I can soapbox about for days.

144
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,700
And I won't try to bore
too many people out there

145
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,990
but it's the wrong metric

146
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,940
when you're talking about your
analysts or your engineers.

147
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,500
It drives them to make quick decisions

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,770
and rapidly resolve issues.

149
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,530
That's the wrong behavior in
your security operations team.

150
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,409
When you're trying to keep servers

151
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,300
up or the network passing traffic or just

152
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,430
anything that means keeping
blinking lights blinking,

153
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,480
it's a great metric

154
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,350
because it drives uptime
and it drives that response.

155
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,680
But what MTTR doesn't tell you is anything

156
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,100
about security operations.

157
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,010
Resolving tickets takes time

158
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,520
especially if you want that high fidelity,

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,020
true true positives and
true false positives.

160
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,580
When you're going through
that, it takes even more time.

161
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,030
You wanna have confidence in your decision

162
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,030
and confidence in how you
are handling those events.

163
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,160
You need to allow your
analyst to build a story

164
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,860
and build it properly.

165
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,060
Define the who, where,
why, what, when and how

166
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,560
and really put together that story.

167
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,000
If anything is missing from that

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,700
you wind up with a lower confidence inside

169
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,200
of your true positive and
false positive results.

170
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,500
And it can lead to a compromise
cleaning onto a foothold

171
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,130
and a foothold, becoming
a breach in short order.

172
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,150
Analysts need to feel supported

173
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,049
and they have the proper
time to investigate a ticket

174
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,060
without a ticking time clock.

175
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,940
When MTTR is allowed
and security operations

176
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,060
it really just drives the wrong behavior.

177
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,160
It's one of those things that we really

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,587
need to understand and remove from SOCs

179
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,180
because we don't want people
cherry picking tickets

180
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,540
because they know, Oh,
I've done this before,

181
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,848
I've seen this before.

182
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:29,380
Let me grab this one because
I can resolve this quickly

183
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,370
and make sure I stay

184
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,190
on top of that leaderboard
with a very short MTTR time.

185
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,110
It doesn't lead to a robust
amount of knowledge in your SOC

186
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,100
because they're gonna hover
around things that they know

187
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,720
and that they're confident that they know

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,573
and they can answer really quickly.

189
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,242
- Yeah.

190
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,079
And we're gonna get pushed back

191
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,205
because every security product has MTTR

192
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:57,470
in their dashboards and their reports.

193
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,223
And we're not saying MTTR is useless,

194
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:05,060
it is can be used for reporting.

195
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,060
It can be used to assess if
your automation is working.

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,600
It's just not a good metric
to measure your airless by.

197
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
Because again, it drives
the wrong behavior,

198
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,980
it pushes them to skip through
events when they do that

199
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,100
they're not doing full analysis

200
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,210
they're not bringing those
controls back into the...

201
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,270
or bringing what they've learned
back into those controls.

202
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,520
So MTTR is not useless,

203
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,223
it's just not a good metric
when related to analysts.

204
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,120
So what is good?

205
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,973
Now we like to break our
metrics up into two things.

206
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,560
A business wants to have
Configuration Confidence

207
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,839
and they wanna have
Operational Confidence.

208
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,080
Okay we think that most

209
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,470
if not all metrics fit
into these two buckets.

210
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,303
So what are they?

211
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:59,470
So Configuration
Confidence is knowing that

212
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,170
you have the right tools in place,

213
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,130
they are configured the best practice

214
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,260
and they're gonna be
able to prevent an attack

215
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,920
or prevent a breach

216
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,550
detect an attack if it's
ongoing and mitigate

217
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,760
or provide enough
intelligence to an analyst to

218
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,750
be able to mitigate any
incident or breach that occurs.

219
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,950
So that is about having the right tools

220
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,480
the right automation in place.

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,750
That's Configuration Confidence.

222
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,333
Do I have the right things.

223
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,380
Operational Confidence,
do I have the right people

224
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,430
with the right processes to
be able to use those tools

225
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,688
and those capabilities in the event

226
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:43,688
of a breach or when they need
to do analysis investigations.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,430
Do we have enough staff?

228
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,252
Are they trained properly?

229
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,270
And if not then that
can guide our business

230
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,100
that we need to bring in
a third party for help.

231
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,533
We need to hire more.

232
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,160
These are types of metrics
that can actually drive change.

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,973
They can tell you what to do
next within your business.

234
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:12,044
So Configuration Confidence
is what we focused

235
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,610
on a lot in security
industry, we focused on tools

236
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,190
our tools set up, how
many tools do we have?

237
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,290
How many rules do we have written?

238
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,459
that sort of mindset
is baked into security.

239
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,090
And what we're trying to do
is open it up and say, no

240
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,480
it's also about how you use those tools.

241
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,040
Don't forget about
people, analysts process,

242
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,872
because that's how

243
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:38,400
you're gonna complete the
incident response process.

244
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,483
Anyway, Configuration Confidence,
Operational Confidence.

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,100
So with number one

246
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,973
John wants to talk to us
about analyst activity.

247
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,920
- Absolutely.

248
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,329
So one of the first things that we talk

249
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,780
about when we talk analyst activity

250
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,010
is the Events Per Analyst per Hour, EPAH.

251
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,920
It's a great metric

252
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,890
for understanding how
overwhelmed your resources are.

253
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,260
10 incidents per hour means
your analysts are well-staffed

254
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,900
while a hundred per hour it
means they're overwhelmed

255
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,390
and they're gonna miss or ignore alerts.

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,949
Monitoring the peak and Valley
EPAH times can really assist

257
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,450
in proper staffing models.

258
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,390
For example, knowing that the amount

259
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,199
of EPAH doubles from the hours

260
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,070
of 8:00 to 10:00 AM when
people are getting online

261
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,620
and starting to open
their email can allow your

262
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,010
staffing model to overlap shifts

263
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,290
during that time to ensure
the proper coverage.

264
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,760
The second thing I like to
look at when we're looking

265
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
at analyst activity is handling time

266
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,780
per alert per stage per analyst.

267
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,490
Monitoring this will reveal
your team's strengths

268
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,520
and weaknesses where
process and visibility is

269
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,800
well established versus
where it needs improvement.

270
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,270
When comparing individual analysts

271
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,460
this stat will help
indicate where analysts

272
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,720
need additional attention
specifically by the stage

273
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,180
of incident and the alert type.

274
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,050
SOC managers and directors should look

275
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,079
for where the analysts
have opposing struggles

276
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,840
and have them work together in a peer team

277
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,100
or a create a pod

278
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,000
with a senior well-versed
member and the alert types

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,340
and a junior or two juniors
to form an analyst team.

280
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,610
And this symbiotic relationship

281
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,500
when you start generating the types

282
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,150
of teams where there's a weakness

283
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,170
and a strength helps them
to learn from each other

284
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,010
and really helps that
Operational Confidence

285
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,750
that you were talking about earlier Kerry

286
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,307
because it gives them a good
sense of how they can ensure

287
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,410
that the processes that
they're completing are leading

288
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,920
to those true true positive and
true false positive results.

289
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,540
Incidents by severity.

290
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,599
This is where the time is being spent,

291
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,460
is the SOC receiving a significant

292
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,130
amount of critical and high alerts.

293
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,770
This can indicate configurational issues.

294
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,000
This goes back to
Configurational Confidence.

295
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,470
Is the SOC overwhelmed by the sheer amount

296
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,040
of low and informational
alerts that indicates

297
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,640
that an operational issue.

298
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,080
Do we need to reduce the amount

299
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,290
of fees to get the alerts
to a manageable amount

300
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,969
or can these low and informational
alerts be implemented

301
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,840
into a threat hunting program?

302
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,470
Threat hunting should be directly involved

303
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,250
with the SOC and the results should be

304
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,940
on very short sprints and
feeding that information back

305
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,730
to the security operations
team so that we were putting

306
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,400
in the right strings, we're
putting in the right controls

307
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,870
and we're making sure we're
getting the right alerts

308
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,130
to the SOC with the right severity.

309
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,080
And then severity updates.

310
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,030
How often are we
misclassifying our alerts based

311
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,230
on that initial enrichment.

312
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,810
Are we going to high?

313
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,579
Are we going to low?

314
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,870
This really indicates a failure

315
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,900
in that identification process

316
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,520
and that we're just not
getting enough at enrichment

317
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,970
or we're enriching the wrong artifacts.

318
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,020
So all of these things
will really help increase

319
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,240
your analyst activity and
give more configurational

320
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,383
and Operational Confidence
back to the organization.

321
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,360
- Yeah and just a quick
thing on the events

322
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,090
per analyst hour that you talked about

323
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,020
if it's too high, your analysts
are gonna ignore alerts.

324
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,250
And there was just a report put

325
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,380
out by IDC in February that said 45%

326
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,870
of analysts ignore alerts
when they're overwhelmed.

327
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,320
That's huge.

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,840
So it, it happens, it's a good
metric metric to understand

329
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,870
and it can drive your business.

330
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,860
- Yeah.

331
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,693
It's one of those things that I've seen

332
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,560
in way too many SOCs and it
drives me crazy when I find

333
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,060
out that they're ignoring alerts.

334
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,390
There's an alert, it's
something worth looking.

335
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,689
- Yeah.

336
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,710
So number two, our second buckets

337
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,583
of things we want you to
think about is hygiene.

338
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,303
Hygiene is something that's
gonna indicate efficiency.

339
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,890
Some things to look at are

340
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,050
do you have unused rules?

341
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay, why are they unused?

342
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,790
Is it because a different control is

343
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,699
catching incidents before
it hits those rules.

344
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,023
Are the rules written poorly?

345
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,621
Do they need to be updated?

346
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,780
Are they 10 years old?

347
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,160
And they've just been passed
along from device to device

348
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,610
as you upgraded your
controls and never revisited.

349
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,680
So look into your number of unused rules

350
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,989
because that can drive, Hey,
we need to do a refresh.

351
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,320
Hey, we need to look at this

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,460
because it's gonna
lower our administrative

353
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,433
overhead to have less rules.

354
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,700
The other thing is people duplicate rules.

355
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,610
So if you see duplicate roles, again

356
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,050
it probably means that
there were many hands in

357
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,599
setting up controls.

358
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,399
Maybe they were named
different naming conventions

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,850
and so you ended up with
basically the same rule,

360
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,379
just written different ways.

361
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,800
Again, this increases your
administration overhead.

362
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,639
So by knowing the number
of duplicate rules

363
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,510
you can go and fix that.

364
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,206
When's the best time
to do those things when

365
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,119
you're doing a refresh.

366
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,149
Okay, so just keep that in mind.

367
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,320
When you have these hygiene issues

368
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,379
you should be taking care

369
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,840
of them all of the time,
most organizations are not.

370
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,419
So take the time when you're
doing a technology refresh

371
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,900
or upgrading to a new
capability altogether

372
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,173
to do that hygiene.

373
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,190
The other thing is, look at the top 10

374
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,850
and the bottom 10 alerts.

375
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,360
What are the top 10
and do they make sense?

376
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,659
What are the bottom 10
and do they make sense?

377
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:58,830
If you have rules that are
not firing, why is that?

378
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:03,500
Okay, so look at those, but
also look at the bottom 10.

379
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,580
You have something that's only

380
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,169
firing a certain time of
night so the sort of whatever.

381
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,003
Look into those,

382
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:14,000
those might be your advanced
threats, trying to sneak in.

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,900
The top 10 can actually
indicate just noisy sensors

384
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
false positives, that sort of thing.

385
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,610
So those are two areas
to really look into.

386
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,490
And then finally look at the
number of tunes you're doing

387
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,220
per technology.

388
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,910
So if you're having to

389
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,740
tune your end point solution constantly

390
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,790
what's that gonna do?

391
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,129
Well that's gonna increase risk and

392
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,800
beyond just increasing
risk to the business

393
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,570
it could degrade end user performance

394
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,179
two things that you don't wanna do.

395
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,690
So look at the number
of tunes per technology

396
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,640
and then you can kind of rank like, Hey

397
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,780
this technology is taking
way too much tuning activity

398
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,160
therefore it's a higher
cost to us administratively

399
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,314
and we need to do something about that.

400
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:01,703
So that's what I have
for the hygiene rule.

401
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,570
- And Kerry and I agree with
you a hundred percent on that.

402
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,409
It's one of those things
that I've seen way too often

403
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,460
throughout my career,
especially when I was

404
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,460
at MSSP where you wind up plug
and play and just replaced.

405
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,210
So you're not taking that
new technology, you're going

406
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,220
from an access list based
firewall to a UTM firewall.

407
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,600
And you're just migrating
those access lists

408
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,980
into the UTM and not really
turning on those UTM features

409
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,090
or you're upgrading from
UTM to next generation

410
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,990
and then again, you're
just still using those same

411
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,120
access list-based rules now
on a next generation firewall.

412
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,649
These are one of those areas
that really need looking at

413
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,910
and you need to start
understanding that, Hey

414
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,270
we got this technology for a reason

415
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,050
let's get the most out of it.

416
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,370
This also happens

417
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,199
if you do your incident
response process right

418
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,720
and you have a continuous
improvement phase

419
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,780
because when you get to
that continuous improvement

420
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,129
you're gonna look and say

421
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,320
what capabilities could
have prevented against this

422
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,950
which should lead to more hygiene

423
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,360
of your rules to make sure
that you're fine tuning those

424
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,520
and making sure that policies
are blocking the traffic

425
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,430
you expect them to be blocking?

426
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,370
- Yeah, but that's an excellent segue into

427
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,580
the number three is

428
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,430
make sure that you're
using the capabilities

429
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,070
the features that you bought.

430
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,780
So realize the value is the
category that I put this into

431
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,530
and this is near and
dear to to the business.

432
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,300
They are making vast investments

433
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,350
in security technologies,
security capabilities

434
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,149
and the business needs
to have confidence that

435
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,430
they're getting value out of it

436
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,600
that they're getting the
protection and the security service

437
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,820
from your organization
that they've invested in.

438
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,700
So things to look at to kind of prove that

439
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,840
to the business is
number of features used.

440
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,480
So like John just spoke
about a lot of times

441
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,790
you upgrade from a
five-year-old technology

442
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,120
up into the latest and greatest.

443
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,030
And all you do is convert
your existing rule

444
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,940
set over to a new rule
set, and you don't turn

445
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,650
on URL filtering or you don't

446
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,280
some particular feature
you are not getting that

447
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,740
value that the business
thought they were gonna get.

448
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,640
When they invested in this technology.

449
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,960
We have seen where if you do
audits of different features

450
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
I have seen enterprises that are using

451
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,080
about 5% of certain devices
that we were looking at.

452
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:35,610
5% for an enterprise company.

453
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,527
I mean the amount of unrealized
value there is immense.

454
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:43,720
And that may not be the
story that you wanna tell

455
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,510
to the business, but the
business needs to know

456
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,510
that so that they can provide
more staffing, provide more

457
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,460
whatever you need to be
able to get those features.

458
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,820
Second thing is percentage
of visible traffic.

459
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,649
Now I wrote this down.

460
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,560
There was the recent numbers I found

461
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,893
from 40 yard labs where 85%
of traffic is now encrypted.

462
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,550
So the business needs to know this.

463
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,860
If you are not doing any
sort of SSL inspection

464
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,112
you're only looking at
15% of the traffic really,

465
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,940
the business should not have confidence

466
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,870
that you're providing a good
security service to them.

467
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,580
So that's something that

468
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,179
you can provide to the business.

469
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,877
Third piece in there is the use

470
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,370
of threat intelligence feeds.

471
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,370
So we, as an industry, we
use free threat intelligence.

472
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,640
We've spent a lot of money
on threat intelligence.

473
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,330
What the business wants to know is

474
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,760
is all of that money we're
spending, turning into use cases.

475
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Are you learning about
advanced threat actors

476
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,270
and figuring out what
CVS you need to go look

477
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,613
for in our environment to make sure

478
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,870
that you're protected against it.

479
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,659
It's not just, Oh we received
information on these two

480
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,330
ATP groups, it's what did you do with it

481
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,370
The business needs does
not need to know exactly

482
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,159
what you did to it, but
if they can understand

483
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,100
here's how you use it,

484
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,169
here's number of use
cases that you created.

485
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,270
That's what they want.

486
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,620
And then backlog of deployed technology.

487
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,770
So coming from a bunch
of hardware companies

488
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,959
there's a lot of enterprises

489
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,960
that will make large investments
on endpoints, firewall

490
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,270
cloud devices and services,
and adopt, deploy them.

491
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,710
So the business has spent money,

492
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,880
they expect value out of them

493
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,879
but because of lack of
staff, because lack of time

494
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,969
because lack of expertise,
they're not getting deployed.

495
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,290
If you can report on this

496
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,110
this can drive a decision by the business.

497
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,459
This can drive the business to say, okay

498
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,293
here's some more funding so

499
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:58,822
that you can go get what
you need to get this done.

500
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,763
So I'll leave it at
that for realized value.

501
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,540
- Well, and one of the important things

502
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,360
that you have listed here Kerry

503
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,760
is the percent of visible traffic.

504
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,760
And the two of us can't
stress that enough.

505
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,770
One of the Cardinal
rules inside of a SOC is

506
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,180
if you didn't see it, it didn't happen.

507
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,590
There's no log, if
there's no way to prove it

508
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,310
there's nothing you can do about it.

509
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,850
There's no way that you can prevent.

510
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,139
There's no way that you can work on it.

511
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,600
So really knowing what that number is

512
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,159
and sharing that up the pipeline

513
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,600
so that way you can
showcase why you need to

514
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,330
adopt more technology to
get into that unvisible area

515
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,330
or more staffing to handle that
or more automation to cipher

516
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,610
through what you are getting,
because you're drowning.

517
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,479
Those are things that
need to be reported on.

518
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,020
They need to have a metric force

519
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,850
so that way you really can get value

520
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,580
out of your security operations team.

521
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,490
Because if you're only looking

522
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,550
at 15% or 20% of your traffic

523
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,700
you're not getting a lot
of value out of that team.

524
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,030
- All right, I'm gonna
jump to the next one.

525
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,580
Actually, I'll let you handle
this one, Process Deviation.

526
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,240
- Perfect, Process deviation.

527
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,190
This is another one of my pet peeves, and

528
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,180
there's a couple of ways
that we can measure that.

529
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,810
So the first one is SOC
procedure deviation monitoring

530
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,450
for the consistency and alert handling.

531
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,050
This if you have consistency
and alert handling

532
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,210
they will increase the quality

533
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,370
and the confidence in your outcomes.

534
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,459
A complete SOC process
should include four phases.

535
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,010
I spoke about one of them before

536
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,250
but you should have the
identification phase,

537
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,890
you should have a full investigation phase

538
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,990
then you should have a mitigation phase,

539
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,510
and then your continuous improvement.

540
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,840
When steps in any one of
these phases are missed

541
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,030
it can lead to low-fidelity results.

542
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,020
That's when you get your
false, false positives

543
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,580
your false positives and a
false sense of confidence.

544
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,960
What should be the bane of all
SOC teams it's repeat alerts

545
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,770
due to missed prevention or
missed automation opportunities.

546
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,570
The second thing you should
be looking at speaking

547
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,310
of automation opportunities
is automation failures.

548
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,592
You need to be reporting

549
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:17,790
when the automation is not working.

550
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,580
This could be missed alerts,

551
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,457
this could be alerts that
are missing enrichment

552
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,720
and the contextual data is insufficient

553
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,820
in the remediation processes.

554
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,990
All of these failures will cost a SOC

555
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,730
a valuable time when manually
completing these processes

556
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,440
that artificial intelligence can

557
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,170
and should be taken care of.

558
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,810
We should be looking
at where we're missing

559
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,530
because the you automation
to save time and I've run

560
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,853
into many cases where
automation is not doing that.

561
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:53,110
Number three, training for consistency.

562
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,669
Sometimes processes fail

563
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,680
because of lack of analyst training.

564
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,720
On the job training for
new analysts, doesn't work

565
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:02,270
you need a training methodology

566
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,690
and well-documented processes.

567
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,960
This allows for
consistency in the SOC that

568
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,663
you can reproduce a process deviation.

569
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,710
You can track this by
capturing metrics on how

570
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,110
many analysts have completed
each of their training modules.

571
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,159
From there, you can also track
how long it takes to bring

572
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,160
up a analyst to a level
of self-sufficiency.

573
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,920
If the length of time is six months

574
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,460
you can create a plan to shorten that

575
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,990
or whether it be additional
training documentation

576
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,700
or simplifying the puppies
procedures overall.

577
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,520
And the last thing is certifications

578
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,780
and continuous learning.

579
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,680
Do certifications matter?

580
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,510
Yes, they matter too,
especially to an MSSP,

581
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,900
but when you're looking for showcasing,

582
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,500
how many certifications

583
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,520
or certified resources you have.

584
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,420
But beyond that they're important

585
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,140
to establish a common language

586
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,310
throughout the security operations team.

587
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,639
When everybody's speaking
the same language

588
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,440
it helps for them to know
how they're communicating

589
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,600
and when I say alert when I say event

590
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,169
when I say compromised, when I say breach

591
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,130
that we all know exactly
what I'm talking about.

592
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,030
And when you have different levels

593
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,480
of understanding and different
levels of knowledge there

594
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,390
it winds up being I a more
difficult process because

595
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,450
you're talking two different languages

596
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,277
even when you're using the same words.

597
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:27,110
- Yep.

598
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,830
I'm gonna throw in a story here too

599
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,659
of the training and consistency.

600
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,210
There was an organization
I worked with that

601
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,610
their security analyst went all in

602
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,649
on a lottery ticket pool put in your money

603
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,410
buy a bunch of lottery
tickets if you win, y'all win.

604
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,610
Guess what they all won.

605
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,570
So all of the analysts
promptly left their jobs.

606
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,440
Now they were at alert

607
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,950
because they did not have
any formal training in place.

608
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,783
They did not have any

609
00:28:55,783 --> 00:28:57,729
of their documented processes, procedures.

610
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,830
It was a mess.

611
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,199
So is that gonna happen to anybody else,

612
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
man I hope for the analysts yes,

613
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,496
but I hope for your
organization now, but make sure

614
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:07,080
that you have that documentation to try

615
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,393
to get people up to speed.

616
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,383
All right.

617
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm gonna jump to number five here.

618
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,830
Analyst Work Distribution,
take it away, John.

619
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,663
- So yeah.

620
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:16,890
So another key area for your analysts

621
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,430
and the first one is the
distribution of alerts per analyst.

622
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,063
We wanna make sure that
well processed SOCs

623
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,320
well processed SOCs, I should say

624
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,862
should not have analysts
cherry picking alerts.

625
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,830
The alerts that they know

626
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,990
that they can be completed in short order,

627
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,130
we spoke about this a little bit earlier.

628
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,680
When Sox don't monitor this behavior

629
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,410
it leads not well-rounded resources

630
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,410
and in order to function
properly now it requires heroes.

631
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,179
And while we all love our superheroes

632
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,700
in the TV movies and the comics

633
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,040
when we have heroes in our
SOCs, it's not a good thing.

634
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,620
It puts too much reliance
on a single resource

635
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,399
or a few resources, and
it creates a gaping hole

636
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,670
in the team when they win the lottery is

637
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,770
Kerry just mentioned.

638
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,840
So we wanna make sure that we distribute

639
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,419
and we have a great
round robining of alerts

640
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,610
so everybody's getting
experience on everything.

641
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,389
When we're talking about
the source of alerts

642
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,190
we wanna look at where all of
our alerts are coming from.

643
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,030
Understand what tools are
generating the majority

644
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,863
of our alerts

645
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:29,370
how often all the alerts
malicious versus non-malicious?

646
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,760
What tools are the ones
that the analysts are

647
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,350
spending the majority of their time using?

648
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,909
All of this information helps keep

649
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:40,850
the tools that need to be in use and use.

650
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,230
And when you have an
underused utility or tool

651
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,700
it'll help you understand
why it's not being used

652
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,670
and whether or not you
need additional features

653
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,360
or a different tool altogether.

654
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,020
Time spent according
to the 30/30/30 model.

655
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,610
This is key.

656
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,179
What I love seeing is when
analysts are doing 30% IRR

657
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,343
30% hunting and 30% project work.

658
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,710
When the analysts are a
part of all three types

659
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,290
of these activities,
it keeps them engaged.

660
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,190
It reduces the ability for console burnout

661
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,430
and encourages growth and
learning opportunities.

662
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,030
When they have the option to pivot

663
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,300
and shift their mindset

664
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,320
from an active incident
response to it really helps open

665
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,560
up them into finding new use cases

666
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,129
in creating better information
and enrichment into that,

667
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,240
into the SOC and make sure

668
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
that the alerts that do
come in can be handled

669
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,430
at a much quicker pace and
finally team structure.

670
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,610
Sometimes the SOC is only one person

671
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,780
or a couple of part-time resources.

672
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,440
This is an important metric to understand

673
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,050
if the part-time resources
handle network operations

674
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,300
and their responsibility,
then their priorities

675
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,340
may not be what the
business expense expects.

676
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,490
This can massively
affect the 30/30/30 model

677
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,730
I just spoke about.

678
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,100
Also consider how the team is structured.

679
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,040
Traditionally, we see tier
one analyst who handled triage

680
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
and handled true incidents to tier two

681
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,709
for additional research.

682
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,390
But the more we are seeing the newbies

683
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,880
or the junior members teaming

684
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,320
up with the seasoned analysts and teams

685
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,220
the more we're seeing a
collaborative environment

686
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,950
and a lot more growth
in that because you have

687
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,417
the better knowledge share
and a better collaboration

688
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,939
and cohesion on that
security operations team.

689
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,320
The other thing that we wanna look

690
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,850
at metric wise is we can track what kind

691
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,300
of backup staff there is for when we

692
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,230
people that take vacations or
sick, or in COVID quarantine

693
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,090
this can help the business then decide

694
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,439
if the team size is acceptable

695
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,370
or the structure needs to be rethought.

696
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,398
- Yeah.

697
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:54,760
And that's a great one that
can actually drive the business

698
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,160
can drive the business to feel confident

699
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,560
that they're ready to go or
that they need to make a change.

700
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,210
So let's wrap it all up.

701
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,820
Let me change the screen, there we go.

702
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,490
And apply what you've learned.

703
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,380
Okay so we said we were
gonna give you five metrics

704
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,660
we gave you ideas for
a lot more than that.

705
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,300
Well, what I want you to do is
go back to your organization

706
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,220
take the idea of what is reporting

707
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,640
and what is just activity
and what is metrics,

708
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,850
what is something that can
actually drive a change

709
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,949
within the business.

710
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,050
And I want you to split those out.

711
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,100
Do an analysis and figure out what's what,

712
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,740
and just don't combine them

713
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,380
make sure that there are
two different types of

714
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,140
content that you're delivering.

715
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,420
Then for every single metric
you have explain the so what?

716
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,000
So if you were gonna have
a metric that matters

717
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,940
and it's gonna drive change, you should be

718
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,940
able to define what change
that metric is gonna have

719
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,090
whether it be hiring more analysts

720
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,092
whether it be saying our
automation is working, it's great.

721
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,220
Providing that confidence,

722
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,423
explain the so what.

723
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Third, audit the capability
utilization of your tools.

724
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,830
I should have written that

725
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,440
in a way that I could say it easier.

726
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,090
Don't figure out how much
of your tools you're using.

727
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,435
You might be shocked to find
that you're only using 5%

728
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,620
of your capabilities.

729
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,130
You might be shocked to
know that a certain part

730
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,500
of the business is not
doing SSL inspections.

731
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,010
So they're not looking at
all the network traffic.

732
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,739
Figure that out, what are utilizing

733
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,649
what's the realized value to the business.

734
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,870
There's actually vendors

735
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,339
that can do this for you
within their own tools.

736
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,909
There's third party services
you can get then come in

737
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,870
and look at your utilization.

738
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,500
But that's what the
business wants to know.

739
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,733
Are you using the investments
that they gave you?

740
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,190
And when it comes to
the business, make sure

741
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,680
the business understands what
service you provide to them.

742
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,620
Identify what's the mission statement

743
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,140
what service deliverables
are you gonna provide

744
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,683
and then define the metrics around that.

745
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,860
And I put that at 60 days

746
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,200
because it takes a little
bit longer to do that

747
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,790
and Socialize it with the entire business.

748
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,240
And last but not least, now I wrote here

749
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,060
ask execs what metrics
are most valuable to them.

750
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,799
But as you've gone through
this, if you've gone

751
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,560
through these steps,
one, two, three, and four

752
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,820
it's not an ask, it's
an educate and a tell.

753
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,880
You should be able to have those metrics

754
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,610
explain why the business
needs to know them

755
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,140
explain why it's providing that
service to the organization

756
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,620
and then the executives can

757
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,380
take that in and say, Oh, okay,

758
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,380
this actually gives me
confidence about our protection

759
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,563
or gives me direction on
where change needs to be made.

760
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,714
So with that, thank you and
have an excellent conference.

761
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:58,797
- Thank you all.
