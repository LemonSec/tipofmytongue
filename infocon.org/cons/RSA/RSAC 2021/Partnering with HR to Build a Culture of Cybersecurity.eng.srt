1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,340
- Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,377
Welcome to our presentation titled,

3
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:09,730
"Partnering with HR to Build
a Culture of Cybersecurity."

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,480
While this part of the talk is recorded,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,313
we're both online

6
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,300
and we're looking forward to
your questions and comments

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,900
throughout our presentation.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,850
And we appreciate you being here today.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,163
Has anyone ever seen, or
received an email like this?

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,460
If we were in person,

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,600
I am certain I would see
hands going up, heads shaking,

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,610
plenty of you having seen these before.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,769
And if nothing else I know

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,790
from all the vendor reports
and things that we all see,

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,540
that this is prevalent.

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,949
It's happening all the time,

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,190
it's an issue that we're all dealing with.

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,449
And it's probably safe to say

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,230
that those of you who
have dealt with this,

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,089
either because you've received this email,

21
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,190
or you've had it reported to you,

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,190
we've all shared similar feelings
of dread, anger, sadness,

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,050
careers flashing before
our eyes potentially.

24
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,730
Especially if you look at this email

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,419
and you notice who this email is from.

26
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,480
That's my name in the sender block.

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,220
And that's my name down at the bottom

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,020
in the signature block.

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,869
It's my name, but I
didn't send this email.

30
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,600
But my HR team received this email

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,059
and they were asked to
change the routing number

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,170
and the checking account
number from my paycheck.

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,230
And while this may sound like a sizzle

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,200
telling you another story of woe

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,340
about the phishing email that
I had to deal with, it's not.

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,380
Our talk today, is a story
about human resources.

37
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,390
Not the function of HR,

38
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,260
but the people

39
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,130
that we all have in our
companies and organizations

40
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,063
that we deal with.

41
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,869
We made this presentation

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,120
for small to medium-sized businesses.

43
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,930
We made it for the security folks,

44
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,860
whether it's the sizzle, the IT director,

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,360
anyone that's overseeing
the security program.

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,210
But we also focused it

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,460
on folks who are dealing with
limitations, limited resources

48
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,140
whether it's the number
of people on your team,

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,240
the budget, the time
available to do all the things

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,750
that you wanna do with security.

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,180
Or we've also made it for an audience

52
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,990
of anyone who wants to be involved

53
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,890
with supporting your
company's security efforts

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,640
'cause we know those are important.

55
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,240
- So, we want you to
learn from this situation,

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
not just observe what happened,

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,380
but understand what we did to
recover from this situation.

58
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,170
We want you to walk away with some ideas

59
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,820
on how to get started developing
a culture of cybersecurity

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,019
through transforming the mindset
of employees around cyber

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,390
and getting you to think about
how to implement the process

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,649
for your business.

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,470
Most importantly, we want to
help you avoid a near miss

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,593
like we experienced, or worse.

65
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,480
I am Valerie Utsey,

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,700
and I have over 20 years
of experience in HR.

67
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,810
And in that 20 years, I've
led various-sized teams,

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,430
and have been in all-size companies.

69
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,940
I've also had the opportunity
to lead organizational change

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,410
throughout that experience.

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,270
Particularly when it comes to instituting,

72
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,193
or enhancing cooperate culture.

73
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,810
- And my name's Steve Luczynski.

74
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,600
I've spent my career in the military,

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,880
and now in information security.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,980
And similar to Valerie,

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,209
I've been a part of teams of all sizes

78
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,890
and organizations of all different types.

79
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,410
I've also dealt with culture,

80
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,000
especially institutional
culture in the military.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,870
And one reminder as we're talking today,

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,900
that both Valerie and I are
here in our personal capacity,

83
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,510
and we're not speaking on
behalf of our current employers

84
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,233
and these are our opinions only.

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,330
So, based on the email

86
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,850
that I showed you at the very beginning,

87
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,489
let's go back a year

88
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,270
prior to when that email
came into the company

89
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,860
where I was working at the time.

90
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,320
So that you can understand
the significance of the email

91
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,470
and what I had been
doing up to that point.

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,310
I was hired, it was a by a
well-established company.

93
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,130
It ad been around for 20 years,

94
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,160
they had good security practices in place.

95
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,250
The basics were there,
especially with the technology

96
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,640
and how it was being implemented.

97
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,410
But what wasn't fully developed,
was the security program.

98
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,549
One that involved a good interaction

99
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,710
and relationship with their employees

100
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,320
where they understood their
role and the importance

101
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,900
that they played in security
for the entire company.

102
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,700
And my mandate when I was brought in,

103
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,120
was to get a security
program in place and quickly.

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,850
Because we were going through
a very high-growth period.

105
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,160
And as a contractor,

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,210
we had a number of very
high-visibility, critical contracts

107
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,120
that we were responsible for.

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,210
So, right after I started,

109
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,570
as I was getting the lay of
the land and what was going on,

110
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,830
I had learned that there was
an incident before I got there.

111
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,140
And in this incident,

112
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,000
it was an email that looked
like it came from the CEO

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,280
asking for all of the employee
social security numbers

114
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,119
and it had to be done in a hurry.

115
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,100
Luckily, a very sharp employee saw this,

116
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,570
questioned what was going on

117
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,860
and didn't send the email.

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,693
And it was stopped.

119
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,120
So, that was the good news.

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,530
But nothing else came from
it, nobody talked about it,

121
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,840
no lessons were shared, nobody
knew what else happened,

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,960
it just quietly went away.

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,330
So, I was coming in as this
company's first sizzle,

124
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,109
not only was I their first sizzle,

125
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,040
but this was my first time being a sizzle.

126
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
And that's what it felt
like on my first day

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,130
in my nice shiny new suit and tie

128
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,680
going off almost like
my first day of school

129
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,250
taking on this new role
and this new challenge.

130
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,920
And so, I started in my process

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,380
of creating a security program.

132
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,090
Reviewing the documentation,

133
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,429
talking to the CIO, to the IT team,

134
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,730
learning about the corporate
strategy and objectives.

135
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,750
And that way, it helped
me build a multi-year,

136
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,743
multi-faceted information
security strategy.

137
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,010
And I viewed employees in
that strategy as an asset,

138
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,130
not a liability.

139
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,580
There was something that I could use

140
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,859
to help out my security efforts.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,410
And security awareness training
was a key part of that,

142
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,440
it was one of my early priorities.

143
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,120
So, as I built my team, and
I work with the IT team,

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,890
we did very simple things starting off,

145
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,800
security awareness posters,

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,070
I started a series of brown
bags to bring people in,

147
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,849
to be able to talk about security.

148
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,210
Of course, it didn't hurt
that I offered free lunches,

149
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,680
so that they were interested
and they wanted to be there

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
and listen to me talk.

151
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
But the most significant change

152
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,020
that I put in place right off the bat,

153
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,210
was moving from an annual security

154
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,440
and training awareness program,

155
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,640
to a monthly security
awareness training program.

156
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,990
And that came from, I had
just done the onboarding

157
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,530
the initial 60-minutes required
cybersecurity training.

158
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,640
And I endured the training,

159
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,820
and I mean endured that training.

160
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,320
It was very basic, very simple,
it was not very engaging.

161
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,159
So, by changing to monthly training,

162
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
what we ended up doing,

163
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,360
was simple three to five-minute sessions

164
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,370
through a training
platform, quizzes, videos,

165
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,400
things that were more
engaging for the employees.

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,450
And that ended up being the
equivalent of 60 minutes a year.

167
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,530
And these were things I
asked of the employees,

168
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,159
and I asked the supervisors

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,270
to support this request to move quickly,

170
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,180
to just get people doing these things,

171
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,030
to get it as part of their habit.

172
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,840
And I did that also understanding

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,299
that I couldn't directly order everyone

174
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,490
to do these things, I had to influence.

175
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,080
So, I tried to do a balancing act

176
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,050
between a carrot and a
stick-type of approach.

177
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,270
As you can imagine,

178
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,780
things had different
various outcomes, right?

179
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,929
Some employees were happy to
do it, others were reluctant,

180
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,250
supervisors felt like
it was an added burden

181
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,610
on their already busy teams.

182
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,030
My direct bosses, they
thought it was great.

183
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,750
They actually wish I
would have gone faster

184
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,270
and bit a little bit more
on the stick side of things

185
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,240
because of the importance of the contracts

186
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,290
that we were overseeing.

187
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,750
So, things got off to an okay start.

188
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,520
It wasn't super smooth, it
wasn't as fast as I wanted,

189
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,686
but things work well enough.

190
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,690
- So, Steve and I noticed
that we had a lot in common

191
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,469
and quickly built a
friendship and partnership.

192
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,570
Pre-pandemics, Steve I
enjoy taking a few minutes

193
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,840
to leave the office and
sit down for a coffee talk.

194
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,619
His coffee-talk conversations
gave us a great opportunity

195
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,760
to see each other's department activities

196
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,349
from a different viewpoint.

197
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,280
I sat in many meetings with Steve

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,289
watching him explain his next steps

199
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,400
in his cyber awareness rolled out.

200
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,849
And I used our coffee talks

201
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,270
to discuss ways to modify his approach

202
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,563
and introduce culture to his program.

203
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,140
So, I was watching activities
that Steve was doing,

204
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,630
and saw him tackling this
cyber-awareness program

205
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,430
from a process mindset.

206
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,580
It was systematic and organized,

207
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,900
I need to get the employees
to do these five things.

208
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,429
However, many employees
were responding the same way

209
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,739
they do anything that's new

210
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,320
and takes them away from
their day-to-day duties.

211
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,809
Cyber awareness was this unimportant thing

212
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,309
that an executive was pushing.

213
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,630
It's not gonna help me do
my job, or get me promoted.

214
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,790
This process mindset comes
out as just one more thing

215
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,640
as Steve had mentioned earlier

216
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,353
in terms of the supervisor
and employee experience.

217
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,750
And they were totally missing the point

218
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,810
and the importance of the program,

219
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,959
and making it just an IT problem

220
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,400
versus being cybersecurity
and all-employee problem.

221
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,640
And this is where I
realized Steve might learn,

222
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,949
from my experience,
developing corporate culture.

223
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,090
Thinking about this from
a resilience perspective,

224
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,320
Steve needed to use the
strong culture around him

225
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,990
to support his efforts.

226
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,300
He needed the lively,
engaging conversations

227
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,670
about cybersecurity to
continue when he wasn't around,

228
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,439
or when he wasn't
bringing it up regularly.

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,900
This change would yield
him better progress.

230
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,640
Moving away from cyber as a process

231
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,189
to getting cyber embedded as
part of the company culture

232
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,960
making cybersecurity a
priority for all employees.

233
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,510
I know it's spring and it's warm out,

234
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,370
but I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio,

235
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,440
and it's not unheard of to see
snow this late in the year.

236
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,690
So, I use this analogy
here of the snow plow.

237
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,330
Steve was going at his
cyber-awareness training all alone

238
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,070
chipping away at this problem.

239
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,010
It felt like he was plowing
through the organization

240
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,500
with this new initiative.

241
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,530
And I wanna clarify,

242
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,699
not in a bad way in terms
of bad social skills,

243
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,210
or leaving dead bodies in this path,

244
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,790
but from the perspective,

245
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,510
he had this heavy and unsteady thing

246
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,111
he was trying to move quickly by himself.

247
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,180
Steve had not thought about it

248
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,800
as an effort that could be shared

249
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,349
more widely as a joint initiative.

250
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,700
Something needed to be done

251
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,730
to get the level of
effectiveness that he needed

252
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,350
faster and with more success.

253
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,540
So, with that analogy in mind,

254
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,230
this is what I envisioned when
I thought of using culture.

255
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,890
A group making more progress
quicker and over a wider area,

256
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,130
because they were working together.

257
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,330
Regardless of the size of the company,

258
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,760
look to people you can partner
with to support your cause.

259
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,080
While in our example,

260
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,500
that's no cloud chain
started with Steve adding HR,

261
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,140
you can look to partner with
other influential people

262
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,670
within your organization

263
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,979
to help you build your snow-plow team.

264
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,270
Partnering with human resources
could create a fast track

265
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,523
to engaging with all employees
at multiple touch points.

266
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,002
So, that then begs the question,
what does culture mean?

267
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,820
It is common to see the
human resource leader

268
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,760
talk about culture

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,130
from the perspective of
how we treat each other,

270
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,603
or communicate across the organization.

271
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,099
While those are important
aspects of culture,

272
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,530
today, I want to walk you

273
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,660
through three key components of culture,

274
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,480
and I will share examples

275
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,403
of how your cybersecurity
culture can be built.

276
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,590
The first one is core.

277
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,290
Core reflects established
norms within the company

278
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,240
and how employees behave,

279
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,240
who we are and how we make
decisions or cheat one another.

280
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,700
Every company has a core.

281
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,150
It shows up slightly
different at each company,

282
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,487
some view it as your
North star guardrails.

283
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:56,170
Each company will have a core
that's unique to that company

284
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,823
based on industry, or customer
location, or other factors.

285
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,750
The second one is natural.

286
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,560
Natural reflects the things

287
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,099
that we do automatically without thinking.

288
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,920
I give you two funny examples,

289
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,959
a dolphin swimming in the
pack, or birds building nest,

290
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
they just do it automatically.

291
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,290
At work, it shows up how we operate.

292
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,280
We know to treat each other with respect,

293
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,550
or always display a high
level of customer service.

294
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,560
It's the behavioral norms
that your company has adopted

295
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,522
and people operate within
without thinking twice.

296
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,069
Lastly, is accountable,
this one is very critical.

297
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,930
This is where you see
transformation take place.

298
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,390
It's not just how we do things,

299
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,130
it's also how we hold
each other responsible

300
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,010
within the organization.

301
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,530
It levels the playing field we are all on.

302
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,800
When others begin to hold
their colleagues accountable,

303
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,640
they began to turn activities,

304
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,310
or actions into expected
behaviors or norms

305
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,890
that everyone in the company
is expected to display.

306
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,949
This level of responsibility,
or accountability

307
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,357
transforms your role.

308
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:03,310
And you are no longer than lone snow plow,

309
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,453
you are building your snow-plow team.

310
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,270
The last thing I want to point you to,

311
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,079
was an intersection of core, natural

312
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,260
and accountability where all three meet.

313
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,280
This is where culture is formed.

314
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,520
A company needs all three.

315
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,020
and every employee must buy into it

316
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,193
and live it a culture will
not form, or it will fail.

317
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,980
As I mentioned before, I've
worked to build new cultures,

318
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,227
and reinforce current cultures
on a number of occasions.

319
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,840
And from what I seen,

320
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,083
there was no need to start from scratch.

321
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,020
We all have examples of
our corporate culture.

322
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,079
Some are more mature than others,

323
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,440
but it's likely you have
something to build on already.

324
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,860
In our case, we had a culture
initiative I was leading,

325
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,620
and was able to incorporate
cybersecurity into it.

326
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,580
We also leveraged theme in mind

327
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,770
since it is instills policies
and processes and measures

328
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,030
into the things we did each day.

329
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,410
Some of you may be familiar

330
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,910
with the process improvement
model within CMMI.

331
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,170
There are other examples like Six Sigma

332
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,920
that your company may be using,

333
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,079
or things that benefit your environment.

334
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,430
It is best to use something

335
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,530
that the employees are
already familiar with

336
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,530
as the process in terms
of be familiar to them.

337
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,850
And the employees will
easily see connections

338
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,953
versus again, that kind of
standalone cyber initiative.

339
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,150
- It wasn't hard for
Valerie to convince me

340
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,329
that changes were needed.

341
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,700
And I should consider a different approach

342
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,190
to getting employees engaged
on their own cybersecurity

343
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,000
in support of my efforts.

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,930
And with her help,

345
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,760
we looked at how cybersecurity
aligned to our culture norms

346
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,140
that were already established and growing

347
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,590
since we were a tech company,

348
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,430
and it was very easy

349
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,820
and the aptitude already
there to think about them

350
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:55,340
in those particular ways.

351
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,840
So, after putting some
thought into Valerie's idea

352
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,260
to apply culture to my security efforts,

353
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,550
I came to the realization
that I needed to build

354
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,000
beyond informal and
unstructured approaches.

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
And in CMMI language,

356
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,650
I would have considered
them initial to manage.

357
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,470
And instead, I needed to change

358
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,730
towards a formal structured approach.

359
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,340
And again, in CMMI
language, thinking of them,

360
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,860
how do I get them to be defined.

361
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,380
or even quantitatively managed?

362
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,030
So one of the first things I did,

363
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,740
is instead of just encouraging training,

364
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,330
I went ahead and moved it into policy.

365
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,490
So, it became required to do the training

366
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,360
I was asking me each month.

367
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,770
That way, it was codified in policy,

368
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,689
employees understood its importance.

369
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,520
The beauty was Valerie
owned that training policy.

370
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,420
So, it was very easy to work
with her to make that happen.

371
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,580
This helped employees understand,

372
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,200
not just the fact that
it was now a requirement,

373
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,780
but it was something that was gonna be,

374
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,079
it's in policy, it's going to be tracked

375
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,380
and it's gonna be discussed

376
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,193
at the Annual Performance Reviews.

377
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,840
- I noticed that Steve
was very comfortable

378
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,280
public speaking at our company all-hands

379
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,680
and department meetings.

380
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,729
And I encouraged him to continue
being the face of security

381
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,580
by also presenting at the
new hire orientation program.

382
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,130
And not just providing this
lies and guidance to the HR team

383
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,760
who would normally present this topic.

384
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,140
This enabled him to meet each employee

385
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,810
and demonstrate how serious
the company was about security

386
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,170
since the sizzle was here talking to them

387
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,520
specifically about this program.

388
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,120
Day one, employees were
introduced to the items

389
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
most important to the company
with cyber being one of them.

390
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,510
Even virtually, we adjusted
our orientation program,

391
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,069
and still had the sizzle presented.

392
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,190
As part of the orientation,

393
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,410
he explained the, why we do what we do.

394
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,050
And this is an important step

395
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,650
into building cyber into your culture.

396
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,150
Once employees understand the why,

397
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,709
it helps them to see the importance.

398
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,138
In addition, giving cyber a
face as important to your costs,

399
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:00,730
employees respond better

400
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,943
when they know the person
behind the cyber imperatives.

401
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,810
I was also able

402
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,319
to help Steve move from
general executive support,

403
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,349
where a meeting they agreed
to his plans to overt examples

404
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,169
that demonstrated the executive
support behind his efforts.

405
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,349
One of those examples,

406
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,609
is incorporated into our
corporate philanthropy,

407
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,379
and we brought in cybersecurity
into that initiative.

408
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,579
Corporate philanthropy was a key concept

409
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,199
within the existing
culture at the company.

410
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,100
To reflect that corporate
value of cybersecurity,

411
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,899
I was able to use my role and efforts

412
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,480
to sponsor underserved youth

413
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,590
to attend a local information
security conference

414
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,419
called Besides D.C.

415
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,560
For those of you who may
be from the D.C. area

416
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,590
are familiar with that conference.

417
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,810
This sponsorship was important
to share with employees

418
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,550
to reflect the connection
with corporate philanthropy

419
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,572
and cyber which reflects
natural behaviors.

420
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,020
It was easy for me to join
Steve's lunch and learn events

421
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,139
since he usually provided
a great lunch for us.

422
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,920
Of course my team quickly
learned to make these a priority

423
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,290
since I was there.

424
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,800
And I could see other
leaders and their teams

425
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,570
were starting to do the same.

426
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,770
Did I tell you about my favorite event,

427
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,460
the one where we had a great barbecue

428
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,870
and I won security jeopardy?

429
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,719
As the keeper of the company swag,

430
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,350
I suggest that Steve used them as prizes

431
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,000
to attract more employees

432
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,430
to his quarterly lunch and learn events.

433
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,410
Steve was able to create an environment

434
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,060
where talking about cyber
was fun and cool for all.

435
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,800
This more important part,

436
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,149
is that the funny events
translated into the employees

437
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,980
talking about cyber and
experiences that they have

438
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,890
that could have been
detrimental cyber events.

439
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,830
That level of staff awareness

440
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,530
will help you create your cyber
security culture environment

441
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,050
where employees, not only
understand the importance,

442
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,853
but they also practice it
in their everyday-work life.

443
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,793
Okay,

444
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:00,620
So, now let's reflect on the activities

445
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,023
that we just described.

446
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,313
And see how they fit into
three attributes of culture.

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,660
The core perspective,

448
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,350
Steve get leadership buy-in and support

449
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,219
so that he was not alone on his soap box.

450
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,710
Corporate philanthropy efforts reflected,

451
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,160
this must be important if we
are willing to donate to it,

452
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,150
and the willingness to put
employee morale funds towards it.

453
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,590
In our organization, we
had a champion that was HR.

454
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,470
Think about, who in your organization

455
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,530
can be a champion with you?

456
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,870
It doesn't have to be HR,

457
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,810
but it is important

458
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,183
to be someone that is
known within the company.

459
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,620
The natural behavior change

460
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,600
was reflected in the
frequency of the training.

461
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,939
This must be important

462
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,680
if we are committing
time to it every month.

463
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,640
Setting the stage at orientation

464
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,620
for what the company expects
along with other core values,

465
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,280
putting value in learning from
mistakes versus punishment

466
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,889
resulting in employees
were clicking fewer times

467
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,023
on phishing emails.

468
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,933
Accountability.

469
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,010
It was reflected in the way managers

470
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,240
began to track their employees
completion of the training,

471
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,410
and employees discussing
the monthly training.

472
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,920
You didn't wanna be that employee

473
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,930
who couldn't participate

474
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,330
In the monthly cyber
training water-cooler talk.

475
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,980
Having that culture, or snow-plow team,

476
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,710
will allow your reach to get
further across the company,

477
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,220
especially when you are a team of one.

478
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,490
Using company culture as a
way to embody cyber awareness,

479
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,800
results, in now having others
out-championing your cause,

480
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,360
and increase awareness by employees

481
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,399
to incorporate cyber as part
of their decision-making,

482
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,250
thus reducing company risk,

483
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,470
and allowing you to focus
on other areas of your job.

484
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,900
I can't promise that a
culture of cybersecurity

485
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,260
will eliminate those dreadful clicks,

486
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,030
but I can ensure it
will greatly contribute

487
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,860
to helping reduce those risks

488
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,870
as employees begin to see
this as part of who they are

489
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,370
while working at your company.

490
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,110
- So, let's go back to the email incident

491
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,990
that I mentioned at the very
beginning of our presentation.

492
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,310
You may notice now I'm
calling it the first incident,

493
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,120
because as many of you know,
there's always more than one.

494
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,810
So, here's the email that
I showed you earlier.

495
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,340
I told you before that a request came in

496
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,570
to change the routing number,

497
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,639
to change the checking account number.

498
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,720
What I didn't tell you, is that
that request was fulfilled,

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,360
and both of those were actually changed.

500
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,879
Even with the initial training
efforts that I had in place,

501
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,810
that particular email had worked

502
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,500
and those accounting numbers were changed.

503
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,660
I wasn't notified about this email

504
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,660
until one employee made
one last attempt to verify

505
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,379
by sending directly to me

506
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,870
instead of just responding
to that initial email to say,

507
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,389
hey, are you really
asking for this change?

508
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,670
That's when I was notified and how.

509
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,660
Not only was I notified as the person

510
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,330
not asking for a change
of where my paycheck went,

511
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,260
but I was also notified as the sizzle.

512
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,610
So, it wasn't twice the fun,

513
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,000
it was exponential fun

514
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,160
getting to deal with it in both
senses of what was going on.

515
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,203
So, my paycheck was on
the line in both ways.

516
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,210
The first step of course,

517
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,680
was immediately changing things back.

518
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,880
No longer keeping those in there,

519
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,380
so I could still get my paycheck,

520
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,250
and that worked out just fine.

521
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,430
Nobody lost their paycheck.

522
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,580
And in this whole story,

523
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,915
nobody literally lost their paycheck,

524
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,493
things will turn out good.

525
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,510
But Valerie and I looked at this,

526
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,010
and we went ahead and
did a root cause analysis

527
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,250
to figure out exactly what went on

528
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,520
and how we can prevent it in the future.

529
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,360
And in my role,

530
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,290
I looked at the technology as the sizzle.

531
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,500
Based on the capabilities that we had

532
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,560
and the way we had them
in place at the time,

533
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,580
there was nothing different

534
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,210
that we could have done
with this particular email

535
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,913
to change having it come
into those employees.

536
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,520
- And my analysis led me to conclude

537
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,350
that the process in place

538
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,610
would have prevented this from occurring,

539
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,350
but the people involved had
not followed it correctly.

540
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,760
The employee asking about the change,

541
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,040
was by chance, and not by design.

542
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,629
They saw it wasn't executive,

543
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,330
and quickly jumped to response mode

544
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,840
completely ignoring the process

545
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,530
we have in place for
these types of changes.

546
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,330
Thankfully, one employee
had that afterthought,

547
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,820
and was brave enough to ask the question,

548
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,540
was this really you that sent the request?

549
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,500
Creating a culture of cybersecurity

550
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,540
will reinforce with employees,

551
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,399
the importance of their cyber hygiene

552
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,110
to keep both the company and
customer's information safe.

553
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,399
I take you back again

554
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,423
to natural behaviors and accountability.

555
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:41,840
- We addressed the people involved.

556
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,570
And as you might imagine,

557
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,649
during the incident and after,
they were quite concerned.

558
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,018
this is what it seemed
like their faces were.

559
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,890
Both when they first
told me this was going on

560
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,930
and they realized it was a mistake,

561
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,763
and later on

562
00:23:55,763 --> 00:23:58,030
when I had to call them
back in and talk about it.

563
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,513
It was an error, it was an executive,

564
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,540
they were worried about what
the consequences were gonna be,

565
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,639
and they were very
disappointed in themselves

566
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,763
for making this error.

567
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,890
Valerie handled the
retraining part of this.

568
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,649
She covered the process,

569
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:15,053
made sure they understood
what was going on

570
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,120
and where they made their mistake.

571
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,020
I reviewed the phishing email with them,

572
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,960
just pointing out some
very minor, subtle cue

573
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,900
that they may have picked up on

574
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
to not respond to that particular email.

575
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,537
But I think the most impactful,
was after this incident,

576
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:33,130
talking about it with all the employees

577
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,570
at an all-hands meeting,

578
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,520
I showed them, just like
I did with you here,

579
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,580
I showed them the email, they
all had the same reactions.

580
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,250
I'm looking at a room full of
people with the same faces,

581
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,000
what's up on the slide, the
same dread, the same concern,

582
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,150
because their fellow employees
had made this mistake.

583
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,300
So, that resonated with them quite a bit.

584
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,639
And I explained how we handled it,

585
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,020
how we did the root cause analysis,

586
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,770
how we addressed everything,

587
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,030
and how we were gonna talk
about it in this room.

588
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,440
We're not naming who it was,

589
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,640
but we're pointing out that
this occurred, it can occur,

590
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,430
and we should all be vigilant for it.

591
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,240
And that is when I could see the relief.

592
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,380
The happiness that this
wasn't a total stick approach,

593
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,690
we were gonna learn from this,

594
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,690
cover the questions and
concerns that people had,

595
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,820
and that was it.

596
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,070
We had all learned from
this and we moved on.

597
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,960
So, I continued in my
sizzle-development program,

598
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,080
getting the security strategy
in place, collecting metrics.

599
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,637
Continuing to emphasize culture

600
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:34,340
and the things I learned from Valerie.

601
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,439
And I had lots of metrics.

602
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,490
Here's just some example dashboards,

603
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,320
not calling out any
particular vendor or anything.

604
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,639
But the good news was,
is I saw that usually,

605
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,330
within the first two weeks of the month,

606
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,290
at least 90% of the employees,

607
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,710
they were doing their training.

608
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,340
And over a nine-month period,

609
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,139
I saw what the phishing
testing that we did,

610
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,730
that it went from a click rate above 30%

611
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,180
to well below 3%, and sustaining there.

612
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,580
So, that was good to see.

613
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
And the best part of that,

614
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,159
was that the repeat offenders

615
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,770
weren't consistently repeating.

616
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,090
They had learned, they
were being more careful,

617
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,760
and they weren't clicking over and over.

618
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,970
I think the most important
part of all of that,

619
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,410
is not just the metrics,

620
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,700
but the feedback that I
got as I watched things.

621
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,740
And I was a part of being
around the headquarters

622
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,680
and seeing how the company was learning.

623
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,530
I could see attendance
at my events going up.

624
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,363
I saw that.

625
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:27,490
And the employees would talk,
again, that water-cooler talk.

626
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,810
They'd argue about the
answer to the monthly quiz

627
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,320
And if they liked it, or
they liked the story or not,

628
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,040
what was being presented to them.

629
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,300
I saw the executives and meetings
competing with each other

630
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,720
if their team finished the training,

631
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,700
or did better than somebody else,

632
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,250
they would be bragging back and forth.

633
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,490
So, that was great to see.

634
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,410
I got compliments as a sizzle.

635
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,050
I got thank yous for the training

636
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,010
and people who said I really enjoyed it,

637
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,930
and I appreciate that
you made this change.

638
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,160
So, that was something
I think is very rare.

639
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,993
But I'll tell you,

640
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:59,179
the most telling feedback
I got the entire time,

641
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,380
was the complete disappointment
and the complete anger

642
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,550
when I changed training platforms.

643
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,860
When I went from one
set of videos, quizzes,

644
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,689
the characters, the stories
to another platform,

645
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,640
which I thought was just as good,

646
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,660
I got a bunch of unhappy employees.

647
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,740
They did it, they didn't like the change,

648
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,480
but I definitely got feedback there too.

649
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,170
So, vendors, if you wanna know who it was,

650
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,490
I had before and after in
these training platforms,

651
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,980
happy to talk about it with you offline.

652
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,433
But that was a, again, great
feedback that I got from there.

653
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:34,960
- So, we warned you his
always more than one.

654
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,100
Right after COVID lockdown began,

655
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,860
we all shifted to tele-work.

656
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,414
Like many organizations, we
were primarily in the office,

657
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:44,860
and the company had to quickly move

658
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,870
to a 100% remote workforce.

659
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,810
So, there's a lot of churn going on.

660
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,860
And there was an increase in phishing

661
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,350
as many of you probably
experienced over this past year

662
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,060
with this complete change
in how we do business.

663
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,520
There is a Contact Us Now button

664
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,040
that was on the company's
external website,

665
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,250
and a former employee
used that online form

666
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,090
to request a copy of the W4.

667
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,649
The Payroll Department verify
their identity by their name.

668
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,830
However, most of the contact
information on the form

669
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,378
did not match what was in the HR system.

670
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:28,030
A payroll reached out to the
Human Resource Department.

671
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,760
And the HR rep for this story

672
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,170
is the exact same employee

673
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,690
who was involved in the earlier incident.

674
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,440
This employee contacted,
that former employee,

675
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,170
verify their new contact information

676
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,530
by asking some verifying PII information,

677
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,490
and confirm that this was
a valid request for the W4.

678
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,740
The process continued

679
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,480
with the IT department helped
with encrypting the email.

680
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,310
There was an executive who
heard about the situation

681
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,210
and sends an email

682
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,600
praising the employees involved
on their cyber awareness.

683
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,770
Talked about creating
that natural behaviors,

684
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,833
very nice and smooth.

685
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,649
Now, this is a short
summary of what occurs.

686
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,483
As you can imagine,

687
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:11,159
there are quite a few steps in the process

688
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,260
to verify an employee,
especially one who's left.

689
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,270
But this was over a year later
from that previous incident,

690
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,240
and it was still on the HR person's line.

691
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,820
It had an impact.

692
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,830
And we're sure the outcome
of how Steve and I handled it

693
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,320
were part of making that
impact a positive one.

694
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,870
While small, I think this is
a great example of resilience

695
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,080
and how our approach encourages it.

696
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,720
It was memorable, positive impact

697
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,950
that enables the employee to remember

698
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,150
and correctly those
lessons at a later date.

699
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,420
- So, I know that up front

700
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,660
that we want you to learn
from our experience.

701
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,390
We want you to prevent
this from happening,

702
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,080
or worst case, minimize the impact

703
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,460
if something like this ever does.

704
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,610
So, the way that we think
you should approach this,

705
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,550
is initially, just think
about how this applies to you

706
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,159
and your situation.

707
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,500
You're gonna sit here this week at RSA,

708
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,690
you're gonna have lots of presentations,

709
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,440
tons of slides to look at,

710
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,620
you're gonna take a lot of notes,

711
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,129
have a whole bunch of
great ideas coming out.

712
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,290
But take the time to sit down and reflect

713
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,030
on how this would work in
your particular situation.

714
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,810
This is equally applicable

715
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,149
if you're on the security
side of the house,

716
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,990
sizzle, IT director,
whatever your role is,

717
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,830
as well as if you're not
on the security side,

718
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,889
but you're listening and
you're pulling lessons

719
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,410
out of what we're talking about here,

720
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,190
and you wanna take those
back and try to apply them.

721
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,010
Think about where do you put people?

722
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,270
How do you think about them?

723
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,720
Do you believe our premise
of putting people first

724
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,660
and the way that we've described it?

725
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,980
What is your corporate culture?

726
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,480
Do you have one?

727
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,460
And is it mature enough for
you to continue building on it

728
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,600
and leveraging that to your advantage?

729
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,040
And I think you should
ask your Chief of HR out

730
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,590
to get a coffee, that
worked very well for me.

731
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,280
But again, don't be afraid
if you're not the sizzle,

732
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,570
you're not on the security
side, asking them out,

733
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,240
sit down have a coffee,
have a talk with them,

734
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,580
let them know the ideas and
things you learned here,

735
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,220
and where you think it
might be useful for them.

736
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,300
Next, as you get your thoughts together,

737
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,530
develop your plan of what's next.

738
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,210
How are you gonna make this happen?

739
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,010
You've gotta lot of projects,

740
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,140
or your security team
has a lot of projects,

741
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,690
how are you gonna fit all of this in?

742
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,770
So, this is where you need to
be able to talk to your team.

743
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,540
If you're at an executive
level, it's your boss above you,

744
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,960
it's your fellow executives,

745
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,740
as well as your teams below
you, your individual teams,

746
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,480
or even at a manager of team level,

747
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,780
you can talk up to the
executives across to your peers

748
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,379
and within your own team from there

749
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,540
to get their thoughts and
ideas on what you're proposing

750
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,930
and how you think it could
be a benefit for everyone.

751
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,260
And along the way, gather evidence.

752
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,590
It makes for a very compelling argument

753
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,540
if you can show an actual email

754
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,180
that comes into your company,

755
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,240
that people see this really happened,

756
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,000
this really is part of
what I need to worry about

757
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,360
to keep that on the
forefront of their mind.

758
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,820
And then finally, start
doing what you plan.

759
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,080
Conduct training.

760
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,409
See if there is a better
platform out there.

761
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,440
If you don't have one, potentially
acquiring the platform.

762
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,470
Updating your policies.

763
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,330
Think about how this is all applicable

764
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,990
in this new remote work paradigm

765
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,320
that we're still dealing with even today.

766
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,030
And then look for opportunities
to go out and teach,

767
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,860
whether it's within your own team,

768
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,679
if it's a quarterly, an all-hands,

769
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,300
whatever that capability is,

770
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,800
and to continue educating your employees.

771
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,139
And most importantly, repeat.

772
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,530
You're gonna have new
coming in all the time

773
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,879
that need to hear this.

774
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,430
You're gonna have old employees
that are staying there

775
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,780
that need that refresher

776
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,620
so they don't get in a rut
and forget about things,

777
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,433
and it keeps security on their mind.

778
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,760
- Let me emphasize

779
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,210
the importance of
repeating these activities

780
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,890
using a common phrase

781
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,200
regarding culture and strategy

782
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,883
that you may have heard before.

783
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,800
There are a variety of comments

784
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,332
about the relationship
between culture and strategy.

785
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,610
Generally, they know

786
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,469
how culture is more
important than strategy

787
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,433
when it comes to making
changes that lasts.

788
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,080
I think we can all agree
that these phrases hold true,

789
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,750
therefore, culture plays a large role

790
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,450
as you try to establish
positive, lasting changes

791
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,290
with your employees' security behaviors

792
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,560
applying the framework that I offer

793
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,070
regarding core, natural and accountable,

794
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,120
you can create your own snow-plow team.

795
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,320
And with that,

796
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,429
we'd like to thank you

797
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,427
for your time and attention
to our presentation.
