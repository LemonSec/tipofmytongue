1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,620
- Hello and welcome to
today's expert panel session,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,420
Super Apps and Digital Wallets:

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,230
Securing the Unstoppable Force.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,600
My name is Lee Cookman

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,379
and I head up our product management

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,570
for ID proofing at TransUnion

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,239
as one of the world's premier providers

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,500
of data and technology with
regards to identity and fraud.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,560
I spend most of my time finding ways

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,900
to make businesses
successful at saying yes

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,700
to good consumers and
with greater confidence.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,800
With me here today, I'm very excited.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,210
We've got a number of expert panelists

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,110
who are just thrilled to have together

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,940
in one place at one time
to share their perspectives

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,970
on innovating into this
new dynamic environment

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,400
and staying ahead of the fraud,

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,553
security and privacy
concerns that come with it.

19
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,640
Today I have with me Julie Conroy,

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,400
she's the research
director of AITE Group's

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,019
Fraud and AML team,

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,280
Neil Campbell, the director
of SecureNow operations

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,630
at Fiserv,

24
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,750
and Loren Russon, the VP
of product and technology

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,170
at Ping Identity.

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,810
You'll get to know each of
their voices as we go along here

27
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,950
but before we get started,

28
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,440
let's have each of them say hello

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,210
and share a little bit about
their bio's and warm up here

30
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,149
as we get started in the content.

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,890
Julie, why don't you go first?

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,700
- Sounds good, happy to be here.

33
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,060
And as we said, I am the research
director for AITE Group's

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,020
Fraud and AML practice.

35
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,509
I'm lucky enough to spend my days

36
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,620
talking to fraud executives
at financial institutions,

37
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,470
at e-commerce merchants, at FinTechs

38
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,510
and learning about what
their challenges are

39
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,453
and offer successful solutions.

40
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:33,570
I look forward to
bringing that perspective

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,402
to this conversation.

42
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:36,880
And now I'll turn it over to Neil.

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,300
- Hey, thanks so much Julie.

44
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,310
I'm Neil Campbell.

45
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,760
I lead the operations team
for SecureNow at Fiserv

46
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,890
and spend my days trying to make sure

47
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,030
only the right people access online

48
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,863
and mobile banking applications.

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,520
Loren.

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,580
- Hey, thanks Neil.

51
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,320
Yeah and it's Loren Russon.

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,300
I work for Ping Identity

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,512
and I've been there for about 10 years.

54
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:01,680
And I have to say I've
been in the industry

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,900
for probably 20 plus

56
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,940
I think I come honestly
with my gray hair here,

57
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,300
but I get a chance to talk
to customers quite often.

58
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,540
And you know, really they
help provide perspective

59
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,780
which I hopefully can be valuable

60
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,193
for this conversation today.

61
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,300
- Awesome. All right.

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,230
Well, it seems like it
wasn't that long ago

63
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,577
when to obtain new software applications,

64
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,210
you had to pick up a CD-ROM
and load it into a giant tower.

65
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,150
And then right behind that
came the world of apps, right?

66
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,010
Our expectations started
to increase where right now

67
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,890
you know, we just expect, as
soon as you think of an idea

68
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,970
you should have an application available,

69
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,410
accessible with your hand,
wherever you are within seconds.

70
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,440
And that should be a
gateway to open up linkages

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,859
to people, finances,
sports school, anything,

72
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,260
anytime, anywhere you expect
to be able to get access to it

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,260
and to interact and to perform
end to end transactions

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,899
of all kinds, conversations with grandma

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,470
or making or checking
your balance at the bank,

76
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,600
things of that nature.

77
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,000
And here we find ourselves
relatively early in the rise,

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the adoption curve of what
many are calling Super Apps.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,080
And so we just wanna baseline real quick,

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,610
level set before we get started,

81
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,880
talk about what a Super App is.

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
And I think of it kinda
like fraud in some cases

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,340
where it might be one of
those things where we say

84
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,700
I don't know how to describe
it, but I know when I see it.

85
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,530
So in all seriousness, though,

86
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,850
we see these kinds of apps
emerging across the globe.

87
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,829
It is not geographically limited, right?

88
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,560
Everywhere consumers are
interacting with their mobiles.

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,530
We see the emergence
of these types of apps

90
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,360
because the opportunities are rising

91
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,530
and our expectations as
consumers are changing with that.

92
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,000
Providers like Amazon,
Google, WeChat, even Uber,

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,120
they're constantly innovating
on their platforms.

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,730
Once they have a strong audience

95
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,940
and based on their core services,

96
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,329
something unique that they
brought into the market,

97
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,210
they began to expand and
with the number of consumers

98
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,540
they have coming to that hub,

99
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,489
they realized they can
be a hub for messaging,

100
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,470
payments and transfers, banking, retail,

101
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,010
digital commerce of all kinds.

102
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,739
Surveys recently have shown
a great deal of optimism,

103
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,580
both with businesses,
interacting through those hubs,

104
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,850
as well as consumers who come and enroll

105
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,579
and use the services on those hubs

106
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,209
and make that a central
point of interacting

107
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,320
with the businesses that
they wanna connect with.

108
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,769
Consumers are provided the benefit,

109
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,700
the simplicity of a single
hub for messaging, e-commerce,

110
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,420
retail, finance payments,

111
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,670
and rather than toggling
between app after app

112
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,130
and relogging into each
one of them as you go,

113
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,690
they can accomplish a
bunch of tasks in one place

114
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,830
and begin to interact with
the services that make sense,

115
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,710
can actually happen together
in an integrated fashion.

116
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,320
Businesses are excited
about it too, right?

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,890
They can take advantage of
deep-pocketed big tech firms

118
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,960
that are handling shared services,

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,299
things like authentication
and great user experience

120
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,890
and things that they continue
to invest and innovate on.

121
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,430
And the businesses that
are supplying services

122
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,110
within those platforms, those frameworks

123
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,300
can take advantage of that

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,290
and invest more and more of their finances

125
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,060
and their time and their
innovation into the products

126
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,760
and services and things
they specialize in,

127
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,770
what they bring uniquely to the market.

128
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,780
But adoption of these technologies

129
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,179
by consumers and businesses

130
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,440
is not gonna be without challenges.

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,930
We're already seeing some of those, right?

132
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,910
Security and fraud are
at the top of the list

133
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,230
for concerns for businesses and consumers.

134
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,030
And on the consumer side,
there's the added perspective,

135
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,770
especially depending on the
geographic region you're from,

136
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,080
your concerns about
privacy and data sharing

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,289
may be also near the
top of the list as well

138
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,770
for concerns in innovating into the space

139
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,460
and beginning to make this truly a place

140
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,777
where you would go to do all
the sorts of different things

141
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,700
you do in ordinary day-to-day life.

142
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,610
So with that, I just wanna dive in,

143
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,180
'cause we've got a lot we can cover here.

144
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,550
And there's a lot of wealth
of experience and knowledge

145
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,383
with this group here.

146
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,150
So we've got several questions.

147
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,580
I'm just gonna guide everyone through

148
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,560
and see if we can generate
some good conversation

149
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,870
on some of these topics.

150
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,870
So we'll kinda open up with
a pretty simple one here.

151
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,580
Digital payments, they
become the norm globally

152
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,109
during the pandemic, consequently
mobile payment movement

153
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,580
has taken even a stronger hold

154
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,640
as have related fraud
challenges that come with that.

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,120
But looking back over the
course of the past year,

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,500
what do you think has
changed in linking that

157
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,120
to where we're headed with
the Super App conversation?

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,950
Julie, I'll let you go first on this one.

159
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,920
- Sure, sure.

160
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,210
So the pandemic really
put the pedal to the metal

161
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,500
on digital transformation
in financial services.

162
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,500
We performed a survey that
we conducted late Q4 of 2020

163
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,730
in which we asked consumers
a whole bunch of things

164
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,690
but one of them was the extent to which

165
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,540
they had tried new
digital products like P2P

166
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,400
or mobile RDC or digital channels

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,159
from their financial
institution like mobile.

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,060
And 39% of the consumers that
we surveyed had tried these.

169
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,060
And the vast majority realized
that these are really easy,

170
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,150
they're very convenient
and they intend to stick

171
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,669
with these new digital first behaviors

172
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,673
after all all of this is behind us.

173
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,320
So I think that the pandemic
really has accelerated

174
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,219
our movement towards a
digital first environment.

175
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,140
It's not just through digital banking

176
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,210
or interacting with merchants.

177
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,320
You know we saw e-commerce
volumes jump by 25%,

178
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,190
but also, you know the
US market in particular

179
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,530
has had a whole bunch of stops and starts

180
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,700
with contactless payments
at the point of sale.

181
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,900
And it took a pandemic
but we finally are seeing

182
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,840
that those contactless payment behaviors

183
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,419
are taking hold here

184
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,260
as they have in the rest
of the globe as well.

185
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,840
So we've definitely seen
some very substandard changes

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,263
to consumer behavior.

187
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,470
And Neil, I know you guys
have some good perspective

188
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,660
on this, I'd love to hear your
perspective on this as well.

189
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,493
- Thanks, Julie.

190
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,650
So I think we've seen an acceleration.

191
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,500
You used the term, pedal to the metal.

192
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,800
I think that's really accurate.

193
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,380
We already we're seeing a trend
away from brick and mortar

194
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,460
traditional financial institutions.

195
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,010
And I think that's just the pandemic

196
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,853
has accelerated that transition.

197
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,790
Julie, also you mentioned
these applications

198
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,360
tend to be sticky

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,880
and I think they are
incredibly sticky by design.

200
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
Once you set up your bill payment,

201
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,010
you're very unlikely to
go to another system.

202
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,900
Once you add an individual
payee or download your contacts

203
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,209
into a specific application for payments,

204
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,000
it's so easy just to stick with that.

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,430
So I think we've seen a
ramp up and we will maintain

206
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,199
those transitioned customers
and just continue to transition

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,873
away from the physical locations as well.

208
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,840
And with that, I'll turn it over to Loren

209
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,660
for his perspective.

210
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,492
- Yeah, thanks Neil.

211
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:03,800
You know, I've been thinking,

212
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,240
the comment about contactless
payments I think is spot on.

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,030
And I remember reading
a statistic that's like

214
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,720
51% of mobile phone
users now use contactless

215
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,380
for all of their transactions.

216
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,080
And I thought, you know,
if you have the majority

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,940
which is getting very
close if you consider 51%,

218
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,520
you know that starts to create that trend.

219
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,199
I think mobile wallets is spot on.

220
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,850
And I've been thinking
about my own behavior.

221
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,580
You know, mobile point of sales

222
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,420
has been really critical and, you know

223
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,280
as we couldn't go into buildings,

224
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,339
we could at least meet
people from outside.

225
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,810
And so I think it's just the ease of use.

226
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,640
I think we have the
technology for the adoption

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,210
and then the ability for
us to be able to transact

228
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,550
a lot more easily with our mobile phones,

229
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,449
I think has really helped
steer at that acceleration

230
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,033
that you guys have talked about.

231
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,290
- Great, thank you.

232
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,380
Great perspectives.

233
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,530
So let's move on to
our next question here.

234
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,900
Let's talk about some of
the trends giving rise here.

235
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,990
Do we think that the
digital payments trend

236
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,740
has given rise to the gradual
adoption of Super Apps?

237
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,600
How has that momentum gonna carry forward

238
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,190
into the Super Apps world?

239
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,733
Julie, what are your thoughts?

240
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,740
- I definitely think that this
is kind of bleeding into it.

241
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,580
And again, I think it's
coming from bottoms up

242
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,130
consumer expectations that, you know

243
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,130
as I have this hub of so much
of my transactional activity,

244
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,620
be it purchasing activity with Amazon

245
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,450
or if I'm a gig worker and
this is not only the mechanism

246
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,900
that I use to do my job from day to day

247
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,510
but if they can also provide
me the opportunity to get paid

248
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,510
in real time via an app, and
there's a ton of utility there.

249
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,810
And so I think that
organizations are realizing

250
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,180
that there is opportunity to create

251
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,489
not only additional stickiness,

252
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,160
but additional revenue
streams and additional points

253
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,360
of loyalty and utility
with your customer base.

254
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,770
So I think we're definitely seeing that.

255
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,510
And also just as you see,
the gen Z coming of age

256
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,120
and entering the consumer economy.

257
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,670
Now these are the folks that grew up

258
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,680
talking to Alexa and Siri.

259
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,439
And so there is definitely
this expectation

260
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,810
among that demographic
that whatever they wanna do

261
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,530
is gonna be at their fingertips

262
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,780
and available in a mobile device.

263
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
- That makes sense.

264
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,480
Julie, I was gonna add
on that of, you know,

265
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,040
when you consider that
it is that gen X crew,

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
I mean they're pretty natural.

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,780
I mean they love mobile
device, they trust that device.

268
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,780
And I always thought, well
none of us devalue our money.

269
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,730
You know, we hold to that very closely

270
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,330
and we look for anyone we trust

271
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,810
and the closer we trust our phones

272
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,699
the closer we trust that
digital transaction,

273
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,460
the more that device
becomes a representative

274
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,060
of all transactions that we do.

275
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,020
So I do think this digital
transformation is coming

276
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,410
because of transactions,
because we're transacting

277
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,060
in something that matters a lot
to us, has high value to us.

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,229
And so we trust that platform

279
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,050
and then you add another app for chat

280
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,890
or you add another app
to approve somebody,

281
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,845
you know, get them consent,
all those transactions I think

282
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,760
just start to become common in that single

283
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,319
or that Super App we talked about.

284
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,840
Neal, I don't know if you have
a perspective on this or not.

285
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,170
- Yeah, absolutely.

286
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,000
I think that's really good point Loren,

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,890
that the device becomes a
trusted medium unto itself.

288
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,630
And then the Super Apps provide a portal

289
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,810
into many different services.

290
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,670
And I was looking at the federal reserve

291
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,599
reporting within the United States,

292
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,600
22% of US residents are either
unbanked or underbanked.

293
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,290
And those numbers are actually much higher

294
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,829
in some other countries.

295
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,890
They're much lower in
some other countries,

296
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,470
but globally we're talking
about an incredible size

297
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,410
of a market that's being underserved

298
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,449
in a traditional banking system

299
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,600
that I think the rise of the Super Apps

300
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,840
will actually create
incredible opportunity

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,140
to bank in a non-traditional way.

302
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,140
And so I think that we're going to,

303
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,480
it started with payments, right?

304
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,710
But I do see it proliferating

305
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,310
into every aspect of of transactions

306
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,532
and beyond financial transactions as well.

307
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,770
- That's a good point.

308
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:39,524
That's a really good point.

309
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,883
- Yeah, that's a really
unique perspective.

310
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,410
Kinda carrying on from there,

311
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,439
you know, what do you
think needs to happen

312
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
to ensure high adoption
of digital payments?

313
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,410
You guys were talking here about things

314
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,040
that kinda forced it
during pandemic period

315
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,930
for a number of folks,
depending on where you live

316
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,829
and what the norms are in your area

317
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,090
but what behavioral changes do you think

318
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,550
we can expect to see consumer level,

319
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,650
corporate, cultural level,

320
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,150
as we look at higher
adoption of digital payments?

321
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,140
- So I can jump in first here.

322
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,890
I think you have to be
creating true utility

323
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,430
with these Super Apps.

324
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,550
It's not just a build
it and they will come

325
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,053
because Super Apps is the new buzzy term.

326
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,690
I think you go back 20 years

327
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,980
to the birth of digital wallets.

328
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,500
And I remember in the early to mid 2000s,

329
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,740
every brand out there, a banking
brand or a payment network

330
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,720
or what have you, they had
their own digital wallet.

331
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,010
And at the end of that decade,
the only digital wallets

332
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,470
that actually survived were the two

333
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,846
that never called themselves a
digital wallet to start with.

334
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:54,580
It was Amazon and it was PayPal.

335
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,650
And they survived because
they were creating

336
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,459
true customer utility and
solving a true pain point

337
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,313
for customers, both consumers
as well as merchants.

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,490
So I think the same dynamic
is very much at play

339
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,920
in this Super App space.

340
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,280
You have to be providing compelling value

341
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,050
and reasons for your
customers to engage with you

342
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,363
on these multiple different
transactional vectors.

343
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,630
And also I think one of the obstacles

344
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,910
that will have to be overcome

345
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,290
is that while there's great utility

346
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,069
for smaller merchants to plug
into some of these things,

347
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,620
if you're a really big merchant,

348
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,907
you're not gonna want to
necessarily cease control

349
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,525
over your customer
relationship to somebody else.

350
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:50,140
You know, you want those
customers' eyes on your app,

351
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,800
not going somewhere else.

352
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,890
And so that's gonna be an interesting,

353
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,730
I think tension that we'll see

354
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,063
as we see these concepts
expanding across the ecosystem.

355
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,660
Neil, I know you have some thoughts

356
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,420
about some of the
challenges and opportunities

357
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,770
on this front as well.

358
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,180
- Hey Juliet, I do.

359
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,609
I think specifically when
I look at the question,

360
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,250
I think about what needs to change,

361
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,440
we have corporate and cultural.

362
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,890
I think corporate culture
is going to need to change

363
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,949
in order to really be effective.

364
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,520
And that is finding the
balance of cooperation

365
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,260
between different entities.

366
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,550
You mentioned some won't
want to give up control

367
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,699
and I think that's absolutely accurate.

368
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,750
They won't wanna give up control.

369
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,740
And it does to be really effective though,

370
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,010
we're gonna have to find
standards that can be met

371
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,640
across platforms, and there
needs to be some level

372
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,050
of portability in order
to really take hold.

373
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,370
You think about what phone
number portability did

374
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,830
in the mobile space.

375
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,660
I think there has to be
portability of service

376
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,230
and transactions to some degree
to really expand this out.

377
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,160
Otherwise it will be
multiple large entities

378
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,960
trying to compete with each other

379
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,207
and just fragmenting the market.

380
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:17,440
And that's gonna have to
kind of follow a balance

381
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,190
between cooperation and also be legitimate

382
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,000
with consideration to antitrust, right?

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,230
So we need companies to
work together on standards

384
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,950
but not so closely
together that it takes away

385
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,910
the competitiveness in the marketplace.

386
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,300
I think that's a fine
balance that companies

387
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,310
are currently far on the,

388
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,428
we're not going to trust each other

389
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:44,080
or work with each other so much.

390
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,050
And it needs to get
more towards the center

391
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,592
and not so far that we're
approaching a level of collusion.

392
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,920
And with that I think I'd ask Loren

393
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,520
to share his thoughts on it.

394
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,353
- Yeah, well Neil

395
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:01,970
I was gonna just riff
off what you said would,

396
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,290
you know that notion of an ecosystem

397
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,879
and it's gotta be open
and we've got to move away

398
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
from being proprietary on how we hold data

399
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,700
and how we share information

400
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,680
'cause I think that partnerships
among different companies

401
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,830
will help create that Super App.

402
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,760
I think that ecosystem matters a lot.

403
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,230
And what I find interesting, especially,

404
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,430
you know in the Western hemisphere

405
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,950
is that we are very finicky

406
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,430
about the number of apps we want.

407
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,430
It's like the latest
app, we wanna grab it.

408
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,510
And I think that's why our
phones have four or 500 apps

409
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,820
as it seems sometimes because

410
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,460
they're always after the latest greatest.

411
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,210
And I think that openness in ecosystem

412
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,160
will help make that possible,

413
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,220
you know, rather than have
to go to a single vendor,

414
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,660
a single solution, we have
that openness that's there.

415
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,700
And so I think corporations
are gonna have to change

416
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,990
you know they have to monetize

417
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,520
not based on proprietary value,

418
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,680
but on the ease of use
and on the flexibility

419
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,180
of their application platform.

420
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,250
- Yeah, that's a great point.

421
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,710
And just thinking about
what you guys are talking,

422
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,320
it's getting very futuristic
thinking about, you know

423
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,240
what are the opportunities
that you can expand into?

424
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,190
And then where are some of the challenges

425
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,023
getting there along the way?

426
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,030
But really what I wanna make
sure we spend some time on

427
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,389
is this next topic here,

428
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,890
the next couple of questions we have here

429
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,520
to really get into the fraud, security

430
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,180
and privacy questions because for me,

431
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,660
I think you're like, you're talking about

432
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,770
it's overwhelming to think
about having four or 500 apps

433
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,700
and all the different
things you're trying to do

434
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,930
between all of them and
keeping up with updates

435
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,610
and setting your profile up

436
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,689
and all of those sorts of things.

437
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,630
There's a lot of convenience
that comes with a single app

438
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,220
but I have to be able to trust them

439
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,330
and know that I can rely on them.

440
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,179
So as we think about, you know

441
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,440
what the top security challenges might be,

442
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,040
bringing all those
different services together

443
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,873
into one place,

444
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:52,070
well what do you think those
top security challenges will be

445
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,149
around identity, privacy,

446
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,100
and protection of sensitive data, right?

447
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,320
Because the breakdown of trust

448
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,341
can be really a central
problem that could break down

449
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:04,739
the entire trust of the
service and the makeup

450
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,720
of all the benefits we just
listed become a liability.

451
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,470
So Loren, maybe we'll
start with you on this one.

452
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,350
- Yeah, well I was gonna come on too.

453
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,990
I mean, in particular, the
privacy and consent requirements

454
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,700
'cause I think privacy is gonna continue

455
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,750
to become more and more important

456
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,905
and a company that holds everything

457
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:24,399
kind of that honeypot concept,

458
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,040
where if I hold everything
I become then that target

459
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,550
where the risk of the
data that I'm holding

460
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,409
becomes more and more important.

461
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,010
And I think being able to detect fraud,

462
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,250
being able to make sure
that I can identify

463
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,730
if it's a bot or if it's a human,

464
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,400
if I can look at, you know,
is this a high scale attack

465
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,420
and then be able to protect
the data that I'm storing

466
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,310
and then more so how do I
engage the user in the right way

467
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,490
to ensure that their privacy

468
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,100
is being maintained and consent.

469
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,120
And it's almost to that
point where, you know,

470
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,149
we can no longer really hold

471
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,460
somebody's personal information.

472
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,010
We've got to enable personal identity,

473
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,520
is a trend that's happening
in the identity space

474
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,980
to help enable end users
to protect their data.

475
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,710
And then corporations now are
really holding only metadata

476
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,390
and really information about the user

477
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,710
or about their transaction,
but not the data itself.

478
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,380
Hello Julie or Neil,

479
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,587
Julie do you have a comment?

480
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,520
- I can jump in and just...

481
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,950
I think you raise a really important point

482
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,530
about the trust factor.

483
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,190
And I think that goes hand in hand

484
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,190
with making sure that there's
a very clear understanding

485
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,340
among the customers
that are using your app

486
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,209
about where liability sits in
the event that there is fraud

487
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,760
and as you get more
and more services piled

488
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,800
into these Super Apps that
liability will differ.

489
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,070
And so having the
understanding as a consumer,

490
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,909
that if I'm getting payments into this app

491
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,513
and I'm storing funds with
this Super App provider,

492
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,790
do I have the same type
of Reg E protections

493
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,790
that I do in a banking environment
so that if somebody does,

494
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,320
commit account takeover
and empty out my account,

495
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,030
does the app provider have to
reimburse me for those funds?

496
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,493
Or do I, as the consumer
hold the liability?

497
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,320
Or with payments, you know

498
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,260
in the event that you're
using push payments

499
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,560
via an app to send money to somebody,

500
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,020
do you have the same kind of protections

501
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,690
that you do under Reg Z?

502
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,380
That's if it is fraud,
that you'll be kept whole.

503
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,500
And, you know, I think we saw, especially

504
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,710
with some of the mobile
wallets in the early days

505
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,170
there was a lot of fundamental
lack of understanding

506
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,270
among consumers about where
that liability should start,

507
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,990
about what their recourse was

508
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,840
if in the event that there was fraud,

509
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,840
and it's created some pretty
bad headlines, bad press,

510
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,230
you know, bad customer experiences

511
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,740
when those expectations were disappointed.

512
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,510
So I think by having a
really clear understanding

513
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,879
of what this is, and then
a very clear education

514
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,030
of your customers will
be critical for this.

515
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,940
Neil, anything to add?

516
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,040
- Yeah, Juliet.

517
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,062
I think of that,

518
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,130
you know you're talking about
the consumer understanding

519
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,620
or the user understanding liability.

520
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,620
I think that the risk here
is so great that it can be a

521
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,940
if there a fraud and it makes headlines,

522
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,580
it can create a virtual run,
instead of a run on the bank,

523
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,600
it can be a run on the service

524
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,550
and a service that's thriving today

525
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,550
could be virtually dead
tomorrow based on headlines.

526
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,230
And I expect that we'll see things

527
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,340
like authentication powered by, right?

528
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,010
I think we're gonna see some decoupling

529
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,629
of the primary service

530
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,300
and then some of the security controls.

531
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,040
And in general, I think we're
gonna see a plug and and play

532
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,170
to different providers so that if it's

533
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,149
if there is an issue,

534
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,280
then the institution that's
providing the overall service

535
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,760
can decouple from the authenticator

536
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,500
or the security control itself

537
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,960
and try and put an arm out and say,

538
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,360
that wasn't us, that the
distrust you feel should be

539
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,939
towards this organization over here.

540
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,870
It'll be interesting to see

541
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,300
if that actually plays out or not.

542
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,409
But I do think that companies

543
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,970
will look at more of a
chain of custody of events

544
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,260
for a Super App

545
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,580
because there's so many different
potential areas of fraud.

546
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,010
And there's gonna be a real concern

547
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,970
that a name gets solid based
on one particular integration

548
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,960
or one particular use case
like a pay at the pump

549
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,630
gets exploited for a specific brand,

550
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,040
than that brand name
that could be providing

551
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,960
hundreds of different services,

552
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,190
can really be brought down

553
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,360
just because of the local service station

554
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,280
and the interaction
that they may have had.

555
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,970
So I think that will be part
of the risk that we see.

556
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,990
And it's gonna be real interesting

557
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,943
to see how the market responds to it.

558
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,880
- Yeah, I was gonna comment Neil,

559
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,150
you're right that attack surface
has changed significantly.

560
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,960
It used to be, you know a corporate portal

561
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,530
or you know, maybe a web app

562
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,810
but now that you're
putting up mobile devices

563
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,760
and, you know pay at the pump,

564
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,620
and you pay at the grocery store

565
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,260
and you've got these mobile POSs,

566
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,470
they have had attack surface,

567
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,530
I think has expanded greatly.

568
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,369
- Yeah, the internet of things, right.

569
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:59,480
It becomes your, is your refrigerator

570
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,860
the future exploitable apparatus.

571
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,743
So, it's gonna be interesting.

572
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,693
- Yeah, no kidding.

573
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:10,690
And I think we've all seen
those situations arise

574
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,450
where we can imagine some of them

575
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,550
and some of them we
hadn't imagined, right?

576
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,379
Like I'm sure several read
the story a few years ago,

577
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,380
where there was a business
whose customer financial records

578
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,639
were accessed through
the internet of things,

579
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,020
connected thermometer from
their fish tank, right?

580
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,660
So there are things that we can imagine.

581
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,430
When designing that fish tank thermometer

582
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,820
there was never the thought, I'm sure,

583
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,889
that there might be a
data breach experience

584
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,130
at some business or financial institution,

585
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,470
but that can become the path

586
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,950
that gets exploited down the road.

587
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,750
So certainly I think learning
from situations like those

588
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,350
that, you know, we're all wary of that

589
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,848
when thinking about
how do we put our trust

590
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:55,330
into this kind of a Super App environment,

591
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,909
and is that any more risky

592
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,840
than it is with me interacting directly

593
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,620
with businesses that I do today?

594
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,939
Just to kind of continue
to pull that thread though,

595
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,930
around fraud and identity resolution,

596
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,310
what do you think is required to establish

597
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,429
a strong trust infrastructure?

598
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,500
One where you can authenticate
and use those Super Apps

599
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,800
and digital wallets with confidence.

600
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,870
So we just kinda continue
that conversation

601
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,399
a little bit further.

602
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,700
Neil, do you have
additional thoughts on that?

603
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,320
Maybe we'll start with you on this one,

604
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,153
- Yeah, sure.

605
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:28,530
I think the standards and where they start

606
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,530
and how they roll out globally
is really the starting point.

607
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,930
And if I think about where
will the strictest standards

608
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,660
come from and will those be
adopted for ease of use, right?

609
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,560
And we've seen that in
EU standards coming out

610
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,350
and then banks across the world
following those standards.

611
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,159
It's just easier to build platforms

612
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,430
to a single strong standard

613
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,610
and then be able to move
into a global footprint.

614
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:05,610
So we see that, and I
think we'll continue to see

615
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,350
the standards where they're generated from

616
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,959
and making sure that we're building this

617
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,400
to the strongest standards possible.

618
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,959
And with that, I'll turn it
over to Loren for his thoughts.

619
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,210
- I was gonna (indistinct)
when it comes to technology

620
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,590
and looking at how do we
solve some of these problems,

621
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,040
I break it down into a few things.

622
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,639
I think we first need to assess fraud.

623
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,230
And that's really, is it the device?

624
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,340
Is it the right user?

625
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,070
Is it, you know, any behavior
that we see as anomalistic,

626
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,160
but assess the fraud first.

627
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,790
Next is we verify and so
you gotta verify the user,

628
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,389
you gotta verify the device are
really who they say they are

629
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,660
or did they come from a trusted source?

630
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,690
And then you start the
registration process

631
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,700
where now I register who I am.

632
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,140
I also register the device

633
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,670
and pair it with the
right level of security

634
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,430
and then strongly authenticate.

635
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,380
And that can come not with
username, password anymore,

636
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,380
but really that adoption of
biometrics as well as face ID.

637
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,410
You know, those I think
have really strengthened

638
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,710
how we authenticate a
user based on the device

639
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,010
or the environment of
context that they're in.

640
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,979
The next would be authorized transaction

641
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,580
or authorized access.

642
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,040
And so really look at authorizes a user

643
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,909
to be able to see my data,

644
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,830
or a corporation needing
to authorize access there.

645
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,730
And then it really is just
then continually audit

646
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,540
and monitor and it's almost like

647
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,990
you bring the zero trust
concept to the identity world

648
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,340
and be able to essentially provide

649
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,290
a secure trusted process
but also be able to ensure

650
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,149
that just enough access is provided

651
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,673
for just right set of
capabilities that they need.

652
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:47,580
Julie, I don't know if you
have anything to add to that.

653
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,483
I'm sure you do.

654
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,050
(Julie laughing)

655
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,763
- Yeah, I think you
make some great points.

656
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,340
Yeah, I think with all of that,

657
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,240
we also have to keep in
mind that to get consumers

658
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,070
to engage and stay engaged,
it also has to be easy to use.

659
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,793
It has to have a positive
customer experience.

660
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,080
And so, you know, having the
appropriate levels of friction

661
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,110
at the right time, and
it gets even more complex

662
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,899
because as you go across
geographic boundaries,

663
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,640
you have places like the Nordics

664
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,430
where consumers expect friction,

665
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,010
they want friction, they
wanna feel protected.

666
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,070
And then, you know, at the
other end of that spectrum

667
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,590
we'll have the US where
it's just the opposite

668
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,790
and there's very low
tolerance for friction.

669
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,950
And so that's really
where digital identity

670
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,380
becomes very important into these concepts

671
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,180
and having the ability to
really maximize your use

672
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,210
of that metadata that
comes with the transaction.

673
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,310
And, you know, you were
talking a bit about

674
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,190
the opportunities and risks

675
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,070
associated with the internet of things.

676
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,840
And I think from an
authentication perspective,

677
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,669
the internet of things actually presents

678
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,420
some really interesting
opportunities going forward.

679
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,820
As you look at the fact that, you know

680
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,463
if you can see that Loren
is coming in from his PC

681
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,050
and he is within 20 feet
of his recognized Alexa

682
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,450
and within 20 feet of his
recognized smart thermostat

683
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,000
and within 60 feet of
his recognized smart car,

684
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,960
then all of a sudden you have
this very good understanding

685
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,930
that yeah, this is Lauren.

686
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,880
And so we need to let him
do whatever he's doing

687
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,000
and not put friction in his way.

688
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,840
And conversely, if you don't see

689
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,530
any of those trusted signals,

690
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,910
that's the appropriate
time to put friction in.

691
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,430
And we're not quite there yet

692
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,800
but I think we're moving pretty rapidly

693
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,740
towards that future state.

694
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,970
- Yeah, I know, I love it.

695
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,210
Yeah, I mean we think
the whole identity space

696
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,680
is becoming more personalized

697
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,610
and it's not just about securing

698
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,879
but it's about creating a good experience.

699
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,960
And I think you can get both,

700
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,450
it's kind of that festivals world

701
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,250
or, you know, that
synergy that is created.

702
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,723
So yeah, I really appreciate your points.

703
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,700
- Yeah and it's interesting

704
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,261
just as we think about that Julie,

705
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:22,360
bring up the example of certain markets

706
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,280
may actually be pleased to
see some degree of friction

707
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,889
or maybe certain types of transactions,

708
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,940
were pleased to see some kind of friction.

709
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,180
I'm sure those of us who
work in fraud and security,

710
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,010
especially, we're always very disappointed

711
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,070
if there's such a low hurdle

712
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,110
that we feel that our data
could have been compromised

713
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,179
but in the reality too
think to some degree,

714
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,650
the last several years, the
ship has sailed a little bit

715
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,790
with some of our private
information, right?

716
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,420
It's already been made
available to a large degree.

717
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,210
So if the new Super App has opened

718
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,110
and leverage is just the history of data

719
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,189
of things that have been
compromised, I'm a great example

720
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,370
you know, without using brand names,

721
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,050
I've shared documents online

722
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,409
in a personal level and photos as well.

723
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,260
I have a public email address

724
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,050
from a major distributor who
experienced a data breach.

725
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,520
You know, I connect with
other professionals online

726
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,310
in a place there was another data breach

727
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,629
and man, I love tacos and all these cards

728
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,860
were breached as well, right?

729
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,750
So a lot of their information's
already out there.

730
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,810
Can we talk about maybe
as our last topic here,

731
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,649
what role do we think
biometrics AIML can play

732
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,370
since just having me
creating a harder password

733
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,679
or answering instead of three questions,

734
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,540
can I answer seven questions about me?

735
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,899
Maybe aren't going to be the best approach

736
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,094
for some of these large markets

737
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:38,683
and ours being a good example of it.

738
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,210
- Yeah, I can jump in on that one first.

739
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,470
And I think as you look at, you know,

740
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,890
first the questions don't work

741
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,220
because the bad guys have all
the answers to the questions.

742
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,750
And often they have a better ability

743
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,623
to answer those questions than
the genuine consumer does.

744
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,960
So that's where, you
know layering in things

745
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,603
like, you know, device
fingerprints, behavioral biometrics,

746
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,900
email tenure, email reputation,

747
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,159
all of that great data that
we have available to us

748
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,562
by dint of engaging in
this digital channel.

749
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,469
You know, when you bring
all of that together

750
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,250
it really does require
having the machine learning

751
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,980
to make sense of it all.

752
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,719
And then, you know as you
are having to do things

753
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,409
to step up authentication

754
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,449
either because it's a
higher risk transaction

755
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,830
or you have some question marks

756
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,230
about that initial risk assessment,

757
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,340
that's where things like
device resident biometrics

758
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,170
are great because we as consumers
are now very well-trained

759
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,830
to do the facial recognition
or put the fingerprint down.

760
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,799
And so it's no longer viewed

761
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,590
as quite such a degree of friction

762
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,590
and you get into even
some of the gaming space

763
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,319
and they sometimes will
make it part of the game,

764
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,340
which is great, that's the win-win

765
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,290
from a customer experience perspective.

766
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,760
Loren, I know you spent a
lot of time talking to people

767
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,680
about this concept, so we'd
love to get your thoughts there.

768
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,629
- Yeah, for sure.

769
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,320
Well, I was gonna just
respond to your comment

770
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,820
about context in your last response.

771
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,090
And I think that's a big part

772
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:28,000
of what artificial intelligence
machine learning providers

773
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,590
that it's aware of
things that you're doing

774
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,680
either behavioral or the
context that you're in

775
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,930
around devices that
you trust or not trust.

776
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,450
And I remember attending
an analyst conference

777
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,839
a few years ago and the analyst said,

778
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,780
you know, why aren't we better modeling

779
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,820
how we interact on a human basis?

780
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,750
And so they're those people that we trust

781
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,350
because we have deep learning
and they understand us,

782
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,290
they understand what's important to me.

783
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,700
They understand the things
that I want to protect

784
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,830
and maybe some stupid trinket,
but to me it has high value.

785
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,970
And it's that what AI and
machine learning can give us

786
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,350
is collecting all that metadata

787
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,880
and being able to ensure that
there's context and trust

788
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,200
around it and then be able
to also model the behavior

789
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,850
according to what you value most.

790
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,150
And I think that that's a big
part of why AI is introducing

791
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,590
'cause it's going to give
us that implicit knowledge

792
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,290
and implicit understanding of
what's most important to us.

793
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,050
- Yeah, I think that's great.

794
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,900
I do wanna mention, I think AI is great

795
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,770
for zero day event as well, right?

796
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,500
We do a lot of time modeling.

797
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,200
What are the known behaviors and actions?

798
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,100
And how do they differ
from fraudulent attempts

799
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,370
and artificial intelligence
will ferret out differences

800
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,720
and behaviors, anomalies,

801
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,839
that we wouldn't even think
intellectually to put in place.

802
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,673
So...

803
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,260
- Excellent. Well, I know
we're running up on time.

804
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,520
That was an amazing conversation.

805
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,876
We covered so much in a short period here,

806
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,560
'cause I didn't even watch it back myself

807
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,490
and re-listen to some of
the commentary from you all.

808
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,109
Really appreciate your time.

809
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,910
I heard some great stuff
today just thinking

810
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,310
about the future and where we're headed

811
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,470
but especially what are
gonna be those challenges

812
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,810
in adoption of the Super Apps.

813
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,290
And I think from a business
and a consumer perspective,

814
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,130
gave us a lot to think about
here as far as cooperation goes

815
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,070
being mindful of privacy

816
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,860
and thinking about the critical role

817
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,700
of things like biometrics and so forth

818
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,720
and kind of a zero trust environment.

819
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,899
So thank you again,

820
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,690
appreciate our time from
Julie, Loren and Neil,

821
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,470
and appreciate all of you attending today.

822
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,959
Thank you so much

823
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,110
- Right, thanks Lee.

824
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,210
- Thank you Lee.

825
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,683
Loren, Julie, it's been a pleasure.

826
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:38,516
Thank you.

827
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:40,051
- Likewise.

828
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,051
- Thank you.
