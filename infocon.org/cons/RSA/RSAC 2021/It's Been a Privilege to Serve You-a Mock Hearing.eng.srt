1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,960
- Hi, I'm Hoyt Kesterson,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,470
I'm here to talk about this mock trial.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,789
It's structured in the following way.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,500
First we'll lay our scene,
laying out the hypothetical,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,990
describing everything that's going on

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,640
and then finally we'll
transfer it over to our judge.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,500
After we transfer it to the judge,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,170
we'll actually have fact
witnesses testimony.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,520
We have to fact witnesses and two lawyers

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,563
and each lawyer will
interview each fact witness.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,610
Then we're gonna get
down the legal argument.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,363
The two lawyers will basically
argue their position.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,980
And then we'll have the
decision and commentary

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,830
by Judge Beeler.

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,269
But prior to doing that, she's gonna look

16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,750
for bowls souls out in the
audience who will actually opine

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,750
on how they would have
actually decided and why.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,450
So we'd like to have some
audience participation here.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
The Who I Want To Grow Up To Be company

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,020
decides that in November of 2019

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,640
that they would like to
produce a set of action figures

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,940
based on Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,929
It's gonna be four dolls,
one when she's a young girl,

24
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,910
one when she's a graduating law student,

25
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,990
one when she's practicing law attorney,

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,520
and one when she Supreme court judge.

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,250
They're under some
pressure to get this out

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,000
in the following Christmas
so they have to go out

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,660
to all their suppliers, they
have to put up for quotes,

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,340
and they're concerned about two things.

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,550
Seeing all the attacks and
everything that's happening,

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,470
they wanna make certain
that whoever they choose

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,960
is resilient, can resist attacks

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,419
and also they don't want
anyone to steal their ideas.

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,530
So they want to make
sure that they're secure

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,320
so that there'll be confidential.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,649
So in their RFP, they actually
put out a requirement.

38
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,640
If you come to us with a proposal,

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,590
you have to state that

40
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,220
you have commercially reasonable security,

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,350
you have to have had a
third-party security assessment,

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,149
you've had to have had a
third party penetration test,

43
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,020
and you must buy adequate cyber insurance.

44
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,256
And so companies run around
and start doing all this

45
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:01,100
'cause they definitely wanna bid for it

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,919
and the one that wins the
bid for the production

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,230
of the dolls, not the
costumes, not everything else,

48
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,900
but just the dolls themselves

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,883
is a company called Dolls-R-Us,

50
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,860
they've done all this stuff
they're supposed to do.

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,710
The unfortunate problem is that Dolls-R-Us

52
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,070
has already really been penetrated.

53
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,760
So nefarious never-do-wells
have already penetrated them,

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,450
they've compromised credentials,

55
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,920
they've taken over accounts,

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,910
they've done all the persistent stuff

57
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,760
that people talk about,

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,670
they've surveilled the environment,

59
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,143
they've escalated privileges,

60
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,230
and they've inserted code
into various modules.

61
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,260
And one of the clever things they've done

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,410
is they've noticed that
there's an encryption utility

63
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,630
that has a service that they use

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,900
which encrypts the backups.

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,270
And so what they've
done is they've gone in

66
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,170
and taken over the role
of the administrator

67
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,623
and surreptitiously
changed the backups keys,

68
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,330
so, Hey, we are getting
backups but since the company

69
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,170
doesn't seem to be testing their backups,

70
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,559
they don't notice that
they're not any good.

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,430
But they end up compromising
management, development,

72
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,350
manufacturing systems, and
they get pretty good control.

73
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,560
And then over the Labor Day weekend,

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,370
when everybody's off,
they pull the trigger

75
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,060
and they just encrypt, encrypt, encrypt,

76
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,900
and put everything away
and locked everything away

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,110
and when people come back
the day after Labor Day,

78
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,970
they see this message, we
would like a lot of money.

79
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,793
Well, this causes a real problem.

80
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,640
Basically what happens
is it takes six months,

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,910
even paying the ransom,
it takes six months

82
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,910
before Dolls-R-Us can resume production

83
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,480
'cause it just takes time
to undo all this good stuff

84
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,963
and things get messed up, six weeks.

85
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:50,180
Dolls-R-Us retains α, β, and γ law firm

86
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,453
in anticipation of litigation,
they know they're in trouble.

87
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,763
That firm retains Technotronic
for forensic investigation.

88
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,220
Who I Want To Grow Up To Be
misses the holiday season.

89
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,920
And because they have to pay other people

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,149
who are supplying into this thing,

91
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,210
they have to pay a lot of money

92
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,223
for no product that they
can deliver, so they sue.

93
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,169
The law firm asserts that
Technotronic interviews

94
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,300
of Dolls-R-Us staff and the
report on investigative findings

95
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,723
are privileged work product and
not producible in discovery.

96
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,440
Naturally, someone takes
the umbrage at that.

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,140
So on May 17th in 2021
in the federal court

98
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,169
for the US District for the Cloud,

99
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,833
we find ourselves with
the following people.

100
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,213
Presiding as United States
magistrate, Judge Laurel Beeler,

101
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,640
Kimberly Peretti is the counsel

102
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,712
for Dolls-R-Us, for the defendant.

103
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
April Doss is the lawyer, the
attorney for who I want to be,

104
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,800
Who I Want To Grow Up
To Be, the plaintiff,

105
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,790
Julie Lewis is the director
of Technotronic Investigation.

106
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,613
She's a fact witness,
not an expert witness,

107
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,260
and she's from the company

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,130
that did the forensic investigation.

109
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,380
And then there's me, your
redoubtable Greek Chorus,

110
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,900
but I'm also playing the role

111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,669
of the vice-president
information system of Dolls-R-Us

112
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,410
and I'm a fact witness.

113
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,733
And so now I transfer the Judge Wheeler.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,000
- We're here today in the case

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,780
of Who I want To Be When I Grow Up

116
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,429
versus Dolls-R-Us, the parties dispute

117
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,513
whether Who I Want To Be
is entitled to the report

118
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,590
that Dolls-R-Us generated.

119
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,989
Ms. Doss, it's your motion to compel.

120
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,670
Let's hear from you
first about why you think

121
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,560
you ought to get the report

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,550
and then we'll hear from Ms. Peretti

123
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,080
about why she thinks it's privileged.

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,070
- Thank you, your honor.

125
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,070
Icon, inspiration,
trailblazer, one of a kind,

126
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,930
these are the words that
have been used to describe

127
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,140
Supreme Court Justice,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

128
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,900
These were the words that
were being used to describe

129
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,409
her throughout 2020, a
time of extraordinary

130
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,640
political conversation in this country

131
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,409
and a time when Ruth
Bader Ginsburg's example

132
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,610
and legacy were more vital
to the nation than ever.

133
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,120
My client, Who I want
To Be When I Grow Up,

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,280
was looking to make that
example of iconic inspiration

135
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,400
available to children and
adults all over the nation

136
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,219
to carry on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy

137
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,320
and to inspire future generations.

138
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,909
My client laid out
terrific plans to do that,

139
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,180
engaged in due diligence with Dolls-R-Us,

140
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,960
demanded that they have
cybersecurity precautions in place

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,870
and ensure that the contract
specified that Dolls-R-Us

142
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,980
had to be able to deliver on it's part

143
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,420
of the manufacturing
process in time to get

144
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,293
these figures to the public in
time for the holiday season.

145
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,870
Solely due to the failures of Dolls-R-Us

146
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,850
to properly inadequately
secure its systems,

147
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,230
its failure to implement
reasonable security procedures,

148
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,020
my clients suffered staggering losses,

149
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,349
loss of opportunity in the inability

150
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,170
to bring these dolls to
market and financial losses,

151
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,280
direct financial losses
in my client's inability

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,669
to make good on its commitments

153
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,180
to its vendors and suppliers.

154
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,660
With that in mind, we've
come before this court

155
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,910
asking for the information

156
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,750
that we are presumptively entitled to,

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,500
which is the information associated

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,750
with the forensic
investigation and interviews

159
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,410
of Dolls-R-Us personnel that were tied

160
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,910
to the incident investigation

161
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,630
following the ransomware penetration.

162
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,960
We know that Technotronic
did work before the incident,

163
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,750
we know Technotronic did
work after the incident,

164
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,130
we have reason to believe that failure

165
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,900
to remediate the early issues led to,

166
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,849
and at least in part
the incident that caused

167
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,580
my client's damages.

168
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,500
And of course, as the court is aware,

169
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,070
it is always the party claiming privilege

170
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,909
that has the burden to
establish privilege.

171
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,280
We believe in this matter
that Technotronic ' engagement

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,109
was part of a routine business procedure

173
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,080
and set of operations that Dolls-R-Us

174
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,800
would have carried out in any event

175
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,880
and that it is not entitled to the shield

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,830
of attorney-client
privilege or work product,

177
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,439
which currently Dolls-R-Us
as attempting to use

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,220
to withhold that information.

179
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,039
- Good, thank you, Ms. Doss.

180
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,659
Ms. Peretti, it is your
burden to establish privilege,

181
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,699
what's the basis for your
contention that it's privileged?

182
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,010
- Yes, your honor, we
are here today to address

183
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,770
two protections fundamental
to the practice of law.

184
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,610
First, the protection of communications

185
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,210
between an attorney and her client

186
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,020
through the attorney client privilege,

187
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,703
second, the protection over work product,

188
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,890
an attorney or its agents generate

189
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,150
when anticipation in litigation.

190
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,370
Well, these protections are
generally well-established.

191
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,590
We are here today to settle
whether the protections

192
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,260
should fall, where the
protection should fall

193
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,130
based on the facts of this
case and what are the facts.

194
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,580
Dolls-R-Us has been
contracted by plaintiff

195
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,980
to manufacture a series

196
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,930
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg action figures.

197
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,219
As part of the contracting
process with the plaintiff,

198
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,770
Dolls-R-Us agreed to perform

199
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,170
a third party security
assessment and pen testing

200
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,729
of its information systems.

201
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,420
These assessments and pen
testing were completed last June.

202
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,110
Then in September, Dolls-R-Us
suffered a ransomware attack.

203
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,320
This attack crippled its
operation for at least six weeks,

204
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,790
which resulted in production
delays for its products

205
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,250
and services, products and specifically

206
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,410
to the new line of the Ruth
Bader Ginsburg action figures.

207
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,589
As you will hear today through testimony

208
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,210
from the director of
Technotronic Investigations,

209
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,010
and the Dolls-R-Us vice
president of information systems,

210
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,590
Dolls-R-Us immediately
engaged outside councils

211
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,360
to investigate the matter
and manage the legal risk

212
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
associated with the attack.

213
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
Legal counsel then engaged

214
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,100
in external cybersecurity
forensics firm, Technotronic

215
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,950
to investigate and remediate the attack

216
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,360
and all the communications
and work product

217
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,960
relating to that
investigation were directed

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,230
and controlled by Dolls-R-Us in-house

219
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,240
and outside legal counsel.

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,780
It is Dolls-R-Us position
that the communications

221
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,150
and information regarding
the ransomware investigation

222
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,870
with Technotronic, including
the forensic report

223
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,170
are protected under the
attorney client privilege

224
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,770
and the work product doctrine.

225
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,120
But we must also be
precise in drawing the line

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,370
around what constitutes
protected information here.

227
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,810
The court should distinguish

228
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,199
between the general
cybersecurity assessment

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,360
and penetration testing performed in June,

230
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,490
and the materials generally generated

231
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,470
as part of the privilege
ransomware investigation.

232
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,064
Dolls-R-Us is not claiming

233
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:55,939
the general cybersecurity
assessment and penetration testing

234
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,980
performed in June are protected

235
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,380
by the attorney client privilege

236
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,990
or the work product doctrine.

237
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,260
This work was not done at
the direction of counsel

238
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,540
or in anticipation of litigation,

239
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,360
but rather to support the
business and contracting needs

240
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
of the company.

241
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,760
In contrast, the ransomware
investigation was conducted

242
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,010
and led outside counsel
and its primary purpose

243
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,260
was to provide legal advice to Dolls-R-Us

244
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,310
in anticipation of litigation.

245
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,747
Unlike the general business
purpose of the June incident,

246
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:26,699
the ransomware investigation involved both

247
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,540
a whole host of legal issues.

248
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,709
Those legal issues are for example,

249
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,680
whether there was data exfiltration

250
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,339
or other unauthorized access to systems

251
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,740
that would trigger state data
breach notification statutes,

252
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,910
whether the incident was
material to the organization

253
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,010
of Dolls-R-Us, and could
trigger SEC disclosures

254
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,480
or other contractual
reporting obligations,

255
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,540
whether engaging with
and communicating with

256
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,099
and paying threat actors
could violate OFAC Sanction

257
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,880
or international sanctions against

258
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,189
providing support to terrorists,

259
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,560
and whether there's an
increased risk of legal claims

260
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,859
or litigation arising out of the incident

261
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,410
and what defenses might be
available to Dolls-R-Us.

262
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,150
So of course, Dolls-R-Us bears the burden

263
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,180
of establishing that
the asserted privileges

264
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,959
and protections apply.

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,450
To satisfy that burden,
Dolls-R-Us will begin testimony

266
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,170
from two individuals,

267
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,050
Julie Lewis, the director of
Technotronic Investigations

268
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,760
and Hoyt L. Kesterson The Second,

269
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,717
the vice president of information
systems of Dolls-R-Us.

270
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:36,720
And this testimony will confirm

271
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,380
that the ransomware investigation
was for a legal purpose

272
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,890
and different in scope from
the general business purpose

273
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,960
of the cybersecurity work that the company

274
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,800
had previously done.

275
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,219
And lastly, we will close
with legal arguments

276
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,980
showing how these facts
satisfy the various standards

277
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,240
for attorney client privilege
and work product protection.

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,820
- All right thank you very much to both

279
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,570
for those opening remarks.

280
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,440
And the witnesses
previously have been sworn

281
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
in the interest of efficiency.

282
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,150
And so Ms. Peretti, I understand
that you're going to call

283
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,083
your first witness Ms. Lewis
from Technotronic, Ms. Lewis.

284
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,660
- Ms. Lewis, can you please
state your name for the record.

285
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,850
- Absolutely, Julie Lewis.

286
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,070
- And what is your occupation?

287
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,070
- Sure, I'm director of
Technotronic Investigations.

288
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,520
- Okay and can you describe
what Technotronic is?

289
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,199
- Absolutely, Technotronic is a provider

290
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,380
of security assessments, pen testing,

291
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,740
as well as incident response

292
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,833
and cyber investigation services.

293
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,213
- And what is a vendor
security assessment?

294
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,100
- Sure, a vendor security assessment

295
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,100
is looking at the controls
within a organization

296
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,800
to see where there may be weaknesses

297
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,859
and recommending changes
that need to occur

298
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,860
based on a vendor
requirement for due diligence

299
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,463
and looking at their security controls.

300
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,163
- And how do these
security assessments occur?

301
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,610
- So generally these security assessments

302
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,970
could be brought based on internal needs

303
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,050
where a company just wants to strengthen

304
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,410
their security controls
or could be brought on

305
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,410
by an external vendor
requirement where a corporation's

306
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,413
looking to use our client for services.

307
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,173
- Okay and what is penetration testing?

308
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,410
- So a penetration test is
essentially hiring a third party,

309
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,120
like Technotronic to try to
access or penetrate systems

310
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,470
or applications that
you believe are secure.

311
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,750
It is like trying to simulate
the way a threat actor

312
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,770
or hacker would try to
access systems illegally.

313
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,770
It's also known as red team
testing in the security world.

314
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,820
- And what is incident response
or a cyber investigation?

315
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,690
What type of services are those?

316
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,850
- Yeah, a cyber investigation is generally

317
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,100
when there's some known
wrongdoing, for example,

318
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,100
hacker or insider got into
systems and trying to figure out

319
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,450
the who, what, when and
how of what happened,

320
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,110
trying to stop any kind of data incident

321
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,840
as well as looking for PI and PHI

322
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,623
which may have been affected
for breach notifications.

323
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,760
- And what is a forensic investigation,

324
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,130
or is that the same thing
as incident response

325
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,653
of a cyber investigation?

326
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,720
- It's really the same
thing where we're conducting

327
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,480
an analysis in providing
information on what happened

328
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,153
in generally into a report
if requested by counsel.

329
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,680
- And how does Technotronic's
staff engagements

330
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,910
for security assessments,
penetration tests,

331
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,543
and incident response?

332
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,270
- Can you repeat the question please?

333
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,699
- Sorry, how does
Technotronic's staff engagements

334
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,270
related to security
assessments, penetrations,

335
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,819
and incident response?

336
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,520
- Sure, absolutely.

337
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,680
So we have different personnel

338
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,810
based on security assessments
penetration testing,

339
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,199
and then we have a Chinese wall,

340
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,100
basically a segregation
of our incident response

341
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,290
and cyber investigations practice.

342
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,992
So there's absolutely different
skillsets on both sides.

343
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,210
- And for the two
engagements with Dolls-R-Us,

344
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,230
were the same teams used
for the security assessment

345
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,223
and penetration testing
as the incident response?

346
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,330
- No, they were separate
teams that were used

347
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,563
with different skill sets for
each one of those services.

348
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,190
- Okay and was there any individuals

349
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,923
that participated in both efforts?

350
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,839
- The only overlap would be
myself in doing the agreements

351
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,782
but not on the actual underlying
work or quality control.

352
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,630
- And then, Ms. Lewis without revealing

353
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,300
any privileged information,
what services as any,

354
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,233
has Technotronic provided to Dolls-R-Us?

355
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,960
- Sure we were engaged back in June

356
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,483
to perform security
assessment and pen testing.

357
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,060
And then after we provided
the results of that,

358
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,060
we were engaged by external
counsel in September

359
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,620
to conduct a cyber
forensics or you may call it

360
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,820
incident response and
cyber investigations.

361
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
- And are you familiar with the agreements

362
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,533
Technotronic signed to
provide these services?

363
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,510
- Absolutely, the first agreement

364
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,893
was with Technotronic directly.

365
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,260
We performed that at, we were
brought in by Hoyt Kesterson

366
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,433
who is the VP of information systems.

367
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,200
The second part that we
performed again with segregation

368
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,200
and a Chinese wall, was to
perform our cyber forensics work

369
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,300
or incident response.

370
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,300
And that was external counsel, α, β, γ

371
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,649
was directly reached out to
us for that with work directed

372
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,590
by the law firm.

373
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,840
- So who signed both of these engagements?

374
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,429
Who signed the security
assessment agreement?

375
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,760
- Yeah, the first agreement,
the security assessment

376
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,730
and pen testing was
signed by Mr. Kesterson,

377
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,710
again, who's the vice
president information systems.

378
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,060
The second agreement
for cyber forensics work

379
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,450
was signed by external counsel α, β, γ.

380
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,460
- And was the scope of
services for each agreement

381
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,183
the same or very different?

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,430
- The scope was completely
different on both

383
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,430
and different staffing
was used on both matters.

384
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,540
- And can you give us
a sense quickly of what

385
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,263
the scope of services
was for each of them?

386
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,460
- Sure so the first scope was again,

387
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,903
that was directly with Technotronic,

388
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,510
was performing security
assessment for a vendor need

389
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,140
that was required in due diligence

390
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,033
and then penetration testing,

391
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,460
so that would be looking
for potential holes

392
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,547
that a hacker or external
party might perform

393
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,810
against what they consider
their secure environment.

394
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,110
The second is the cyber
forensics and that again

395
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,306
was with α, β, γ.

396
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:10,970
And that was looking at what had happened,

397
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,510
looking at how to get
them back up and running

398
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,546
when they were hit with ransomware,

399
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:21,370
and then performing analysis and a report

400
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,120
and then subsequently
looking at any PI or PHI

401
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,189
that might've been affected.

402
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,980
- I just wanna remind you
Ms. Peretti of the time.

403
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,760
- Okay, I just had two
last short questions.

404
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,290
Was there a forensic report
prepared for the engagement

405
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,393
with Dolls-R-Us?

406
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,310
- Yes, there was and that
was provided directly

407
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,760
to external counsel.

408
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,030
- And who directed Technotronic
to produce that report?

409
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,910
- That was α, β, γ, the
law firm, external counsel.

410
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,478
- Thank you very much, I
have no further questions.

411
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:57,150
- All right, Ms. Doss, your witness.

412
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,120
- Ms. Lewis, thank you
for being here today.

413
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,300
How long has Technotronic
been in the business

414
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,193
of doing security assessments?

415
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,580
- We've been doing this for over 10 years.

416
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,189
- And how long have you
been in the business

417
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,350
of doing incident response
or forensics reports?

418
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,139
- Sure, we've been doing cyber forensics

419
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,503
and computer forensics for over 18 years.

420
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,210
- Are you familiar from that
experience with the fact that

421
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,760
in some instances incident
response vendors work

422
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,643
is covered by insurance?

423
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,540
- Yes, absolutely.

424
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,800
- And that sometimes insurers

425
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,570
that underwrite cyber insurance coverage

426
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,290
in fact have lists or
panels of preferred vendors

427
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,750
that they approved for
use under covered acts,

428
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,980
is that right?

429
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,983
- That's correct.

430
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,080
- Technotronic wasn't
on the preferred list

431
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,860
for the cyber insurance
company that provided coverage

432
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,399
for Dolls-R-Us, was it?

433
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,660
- No, it was not at the time.

434
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,270
- So you were not part of
any of the panel coverage

435
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,770
that would ordinarily be retained

436
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,129
for an incident involving
Dolls-R-Us, is that correct?

437
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,183
- That is correct.

438
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:21,240
- So in fact there was a specific request

439
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,130
to add Technotronic to the
list of authorized providers

440
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,883
for Dolls-R-Us cyber
insurance, isn't that correct?

441
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,660
- That's correct because we were involved

442
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,300
in the security assessment
and pen testing,

443
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,760
so we already knew the environment

444
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,063
so we could react more quickly.

445
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,623
- And that request was made
by Dolls-R-Us, was it not?

446
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,730
- That's correct so that they could use us

447
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,510
and we'd be covered by
their insurance carrier.

448
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,490
- And at that point, did
the insurance carrier

449
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,700
then ask Technotronic to provide

450
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,590
some background information
about your capabilities

451
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,909
and so forth so they could
determine whether to approve you?

452
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,360
- That's correct.

453
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,379
- And this happened
before the cyber incident,

454
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,303
that's an issue here, is that correct?

455
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,610
- It happened after the
cyber in conjunction.

456
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,053
- Okay, okay, thank you.

457
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,090
And the security assessment team

458
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,730
found a number of deficiencies
as is ordinarily the case,

459
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,820
some things that can be
remediated, is that correct?

460
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,763
- That's correct.

461
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,020
- In the course of doing
the forensic investigation,

462
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,690
isn't it the case that
part of the investigation

463
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,700
was focused on determining
whether any of the deficiencies

464
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,830
found in the security
assessment played a role

465
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,143
in the penetration in this incident?

466
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,183
- That's correct.

467
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:54,820
Our cyber forensics team had
to talk to our pen testing

468
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,060
and security assessment teams.

469
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,970
- So the forensics team had
access then to the report

470
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,120
from the security
assessment team, correct?

471
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,147
- My understanding is they asked for it

472
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,750
and they reviewed that report as part of

473
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,150
the cyber forensics portion and reporting.

474
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,900
- So there was some discussion then

475
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,460
between the forensics team and the team

476
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,400
that had previously done
the security assessment,

477
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,233
is that correct?

478
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,043
- That's correct.

479
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:29,409
Similar to if it was external
company that would be

480
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,570
a common process in the
debriefing to do the analysis.

481
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,409
- Okay, so where you indicated early

482
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,220
that the only overlap was yourself

483
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,740
in signing the agreements, in fact,

484
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,560
there was conversation between
those two different teams

485
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,230
as the forensic team was
going through its work

486
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,200
to make sure that it
understood the environment

487
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,743
it was looking at based
on the previous work.

488
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,830
- That's correct.

489
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,860
There were different
technical resources however,

490
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,453
but that communication
happened between teams.

491
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,750
- And just a couple of other questions.

492
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,560
I know you indicated that
you've been doing forensics work

493
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,440
at Technotronic for many
years and I would imagine that

494
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,830
in some instances you do
that by direct engagement

495
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,110
with a client or customer,
and in other cases

496
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,949
by direct engagement from a law firm,

497
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,583
is that generally correct?

498
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,780
- It depends on what it is,
but in the cyber incidents

499
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,139
involving data breach,
potential data breaches,

500
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,350
it's driven by counsel in general.

501
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,850
- And have you ever been engaged

502
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,280
by the law firm, α, β, and γ before?

503
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,639
- No, this is the first time.

504
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,370
- Thanks very much, nothing further.

505
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,139
- All right, the witness may be excused.

506
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,930
And are you ready to call
your next witness Ms. Peretti,

507
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,290
Mr. Kesterson.
- Yes.

508
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,889
- All right, so you may proceed.

509
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,460
- Good afternoon. Mr. Kesterson,
please introduce yourself

510
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,020
to the court, say your name and title.

511
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,629
- My name is Hoyt L. Kesterson The Second,

512
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm the vice president in
charge of information technology

513
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,062
for Doll-R-Us.

514
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:11,149
- And how long have you
been a vice president

515
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,240
for information systems?

516
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,580
- Five years.

517
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,409
- Can you briefly describe your role?

518
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,780
- My role is pretty much everything

519
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,800
that happens with computers.

520
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,520
That's the normal business processing,

521
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,200
the process of keeping it running
and don't have operations,

522
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,480
but I do have all the
stuff that runs on it

523
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,490
and of course, naturally all those stuff

524
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,570
that secures the environment.

525
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,510
- And what types of policies
does Dolls-R-Us have in place

526
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,830
for its information technology program?

527
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,280
- Well, we actually have quite
a thorough set of policies

528
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,840
for written information security policies,

529
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,470
which here, we fondly refer to as WISP,

530
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,290
we have remote access policies,

531
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,100
so we have use policies,
we have business continuity

532
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,810
and disaster recovery policies,

533
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,710
and we have instant response policies.

534
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,390
- And are you familiar with
the incident response policy?

535
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,640
- Yes, I am.

536
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,490
- Under this incident response
plan, who was responsible

537
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,330
for managing and conducting
incident response?

538
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,332
- Well, it depends on the
incident response itself.

539
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,890
We have concerns if in fact
that ever affects user data

540
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,610
so forth, because then
we know there's potential

541
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,520
all kinds of statutory, regulatory,

542
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,490
and all kinds of people coming after us.

543
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,920
So in that particular
case we hand the lead over

544
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,150
to a law firm.

545
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,450
But other kinds of stuff,
just normal incidences,

546
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,653
we've structured team or out
of our own internal resource.

547
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,940
- And are you familiar with the
vendor security assessments?

548
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,830
Are you familiar with
vendor security assessments

549
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,500
and penetration testing.

550
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,910
- Yes, I am.

551
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,160
- Has Dolls-R-Us ever
been asked to perform

552
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,080
a security assessment or penetration test?

553
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,750
- Yes, to satisfy a recent RFP

554
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,600
for Who I Want To Grow Up To Be,

555
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,379
we had to have a security assessment,

556
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,380
we had to have a penetration
testing and we did so.

557
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:07,867
- And who performed
the security assessment

558
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:09,440
and penetration testing?

559
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,453
- We engaged Technotronic.

560
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,560
- What was the scope of your engagement

561
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,669
with Technotronic at that time?

562
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,680
- The scope is the
standard staff basically

563
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,820
to do penetration tests,
to see our firewalls

564
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,409
are configured properly, to
examine all our configurations,

565
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,450
to look at our policies, to
make sure we have in place

566
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,883
a reasonable commercial security.

567
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,010
- And what line in the
Dolls-R-Us annual budget

568
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,850
would have paid for these services?

569
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,100
- Well, this would come
out of our IT budget.

570
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,389
- What were the results
of the security assessment

571
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,410
and penetration testing generally?

572
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,840
- Well, they weren't perfect
so we spent the summer

573
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,060
getting our act together
so that we could respond

574
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,010
to the RFP that we had
what needed to be in place.

575
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,330
- Did you provide the results

576
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,600
to Who I want To Be When I Grow Up?

577
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,399
- No, we just basically said
we satisfy the requirement.

578
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,300
- Okay, has Dolls-R-Us ever had to use

579
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,620
its incident response policy?

580
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,020
- Absolutely, most recently.

581
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,690
- Hey counsel, I just I'm gonna remind you

582
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,680
of the time issues.

583
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,870
I know that you have a number
of questions need to ask here

584
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,152
but I think we all
understand that there was

585
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,390
a ransomware attack here
and it took six weeks

586
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,820
for the company to recover.

587
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,050
So I suggest you get right
to the scope of the work

588
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,580
because we're already over time.

589
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,413
- Okay.

590
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,230
- And we also know that outside counsel,

591
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,630
we've had the outside counsel testimony,

592
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,620
so why don't we try to
get to the quick of it.

593
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,040
- Okay, can you just tell
us the type of agreement

594
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,300
that you engaged with
Technotronic to conduct

595
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,950
the incident response please?

596
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,440
- That was essentially done by our council

597
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,400
because of they needed,
they basically stated

598
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,330
they needed to know
the scope of the attack

599
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,193
so that they can properly
advise us on exposure.

600
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,199
- And how did you pay
for the incident response

601
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
and these services?

602
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,929
- This particular case, it was paid for

603
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,863
out of our legal contingency budget.

604
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,380
- And what controls did
outside counsel place

605
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,830
around the sharing of information
from the investigation?

606
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,270
- Very much need to know.

607
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,360
We had to actually split
into different teams,

608
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,639
teams to actually
correct all the problems,

609
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,570
which knew they were
addressing a ransomware attack

610
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,490
and then another team, which
is basically trying to put

611
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,980
controls in place to make
sure it didn't repeat,

612
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,030
that those people didn't
know why they were doing

613
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,649
what they were doing and
they were just following

614
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,730
the instructions and they were
following the instructions

615
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,490
led by a very limited number
of people who had access

616
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:43,530
to the incident response, pardon me,

617
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,312
to the forensic examination report.

618
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,510
- So to be clear, did you
involve IT staff or other members

619
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,343
in the investigation?

620
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:51,700
Were they aware of the report?

621
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,380
Did they read the report?

622
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,300
- Only three people, myself, my assistant,

623
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,830
the system director, and one
other person, the architect,

624
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,830
so that we could structure a
plan to advise the second team.

625
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,080
- What other controls
did you have in place

626
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,899
to keep the investigation confidential?

627
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,910
- Well, they were told
not to talk about it.

628
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,562
That's it, you can't
do much more than that.

629
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:23,310
- Okay, then to your knowledge,
did the investigation team

630
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,980
abide by those rules.

631
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,210
- To my knowledge, they did.

632
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,080
- No further questions at this time.

633
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,060
- Thank you, Ms. Peretti,
Ms. Doss, your witness.

634
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,598
- Thank you. Mr. Kesterson,
those incident response plan

635
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:41,510
that you referred to, that
specifically calls for

636
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,900
conducting an investigation

637
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,710
whenever there's a significant incident.

638
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,700
And as you described for
certain types of incidents,

639
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,100
counsel may be engaged, and
for other types of incidents,

640
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,699
the investigation will be done in-house,

641
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,800
I believe that's what you
testified to, correct?

642
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,060
- That's correct.

643
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,060
- So in any case, under
your incident response plan,

644
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,590
isn't it true that the IRP
or incident response plan

645
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,790
calls for determining
to the extent possible

646
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,889
what root causes might be at the incident?

647
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,560
- Yes.

648
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,720
- And does it also call for determining

649
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,650
to the extent possible what
the scope of the incident is?

650
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,830
- Yes.

651
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,399
- And does it call for
to the extent reasonable

652
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,700
advising on remediation
steps that may be beneficial?

653
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
- That's certainly responsibility, yes.

654
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,610
- And doesn't the IRP also call
for an investigation report

655
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,773
to be done for all significant incidents?

656
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,450
- Yes at the end of the incident,

657
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,813
you're supposed to
basically, what did we learn.

658
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,560
- And that after action
report gets prepared

659
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,523
regardless of the type
of incident, does it not?

660
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,820
- Yes.

661
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,270
- And that after action
report gets prepared

662
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,220
regardless of whether
the incident is conducted

663
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,370
by outside counsel or
in-house, is that correct?

664
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,689
- Well, that one's slightly depends.

665
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,790
We don't really address
any legalities, okay?

666
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,030
That's not our business, right?

667
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,950
So we don't write it for that.

668
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,990
We basically say, this is
the stuff we fixed and why.

669
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,500
- Okay, so then in order to be more clear,

670
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,000
is it the case that under the IRP,

671
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,730
the technical dimensions
of their forensic report,

672
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,200
the assessment to the extent
possible of root cause,

673
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,090
scope, and any remediation
actions that may be relevant

674
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,403
are done regardless of
the type of incident?

675
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,640
- Yes, we record everything
in terms of change,

676
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,593
control, and documentation,
and so forth as to what we did.

677
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,250
- Dolls-R-Us has had a
relationship with Technotronic

678
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,340
for some time, is that correct?

679
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,122
- I wouldn't necessarily
say for some time,

680
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,090
we've known them off and on.

681
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,442
We knew about them and that's why we,

682
00:33:58,442 --> 00:34:02,870
we typically don't have a
requirement from a vendor to do,

683
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,560
from, pardon me, from a customer to say,

684
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,632
you have to do an assessment report.

685
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,980
But we knew them so when we had to do it

686
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,350
based on short notice,
they are people we went to.

687
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,110
- Sure and you were happy with their work

688
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,170
on the security assessment, I assume.

689
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,572
- Well, we got the contract.

690
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:26,109
- And so as a result of
the work they had done

691
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,600
on a security assessment,
didn't you also consider

692
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,259
whether or not they might be a good choice

693
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,627
to do incident response
work for Dolls-R-Us

694
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:34,192
if it was ever needed?

695
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,210
- Well, of course,
naturally you think of that

696
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,050
because there's someone
whom you've worked with

697
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,620
and the advantage of they
just studied your systems,

698
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,949
so they kind of know how it works.

699
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,929
- And isn't it the case that
it was in fact Dolls-R-Us

700
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,159
that reached out to your cyber insurer

701
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,739
to inquire whether
Technotronic could be approved

702
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,790
as an incident response
vendor in the event

703
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,790
that incident response would be needed?

704
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,290
- Well, we wanted to make
certain with our insurer

705
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,530
what could be done.

706
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,760
And since we knew these
people, we asked our insurer

707
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,730
if in fact they did do
it, would we get covered?

708
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,603
And they said, yes, if
we do certain things.

709
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,390
- So you reached out to
the insurer and asked,

710
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,279
could Technotronic be a preferred or panel

711
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,492
or approved provider for
the forensics, correct?

712
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:22,325
- Yes.

713
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:25,310
- And you reached out
to Julie Lewis and said,

714
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,160
we'd like to have Technotronic
be one of our providers,

715
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,993
is that correct?

716
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,833
- Yes.

717
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,020
- You talked about the
budget that was used to pay

718
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,430
for the forensics response work

719
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,149
and the security assessment work.

720
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,850
And you indicated the
security assessment work

721
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,190
had already been paid
out of the cyber budget.

722
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,270
I want to talk about
the budget for a minute.

723
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,393
Within the Dolls-R-Us
organizational structure,

724
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,600
the cyber organization,
and the legal department

725
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,549
both report to the same
person, the VP of finance,

726
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,383
is that correct?

727
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,600
- Yes.

728
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,670
- So both budget lines are within

729
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,690
that same organizational
component, correct?

730
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,450
- Well, it's all a one big bucket, yes.

731
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,250
- And you mentioned
earlier that Dolls-R-Us

732
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,960
had not anticipated having to do

733
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,070
the security assessment this year.

734
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,170
That was something that
was prompted by a request

735
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,650
from my client, is that correct?

736
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,020
- That's correct.

737
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,830
- So Dolls-R-Us on the cyber
budget had already incurred

738
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,130
an unanticipated costs
for this year, correct?

739
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
- Yeah, I would say so, but we really hope

740
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,089
the contract would make up for that.

741
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,770
- Sure, but there were
some additional expenses

742
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,330
that had not been
anticipated at the beginning-

743
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,757
- Well yeah.
- Of [Inaudible] cycle.

744
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:42,880
- Right, we don't normally have to do,

745
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,440
we're not under anything
where we have to do,

746
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,420
we're a manufacturer.

747
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,380
We don't really kind of
do security assessments

748
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,890
like financials, forensics, and so forth.

749
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,000
- So when the question came
up of who was going to pay

750
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,910
from Dolls-R-Us for
that bill, if you will,

751
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,279
for their forensic report,
there was a conversation,

752
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,113
wasn't there?

753
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:04,470
Among the VP of finance
and you about whether

754
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,910
that should come from the cyber department

755
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,080
or the legal budget, wasn't there?

756
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,779
- Well, there was discussion about

757
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,290
who should handle this, right?

758
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,660
Certainly we had all kinds of concerns.

759
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,299
I mean, our basic plan
said, if it's data loss,

760
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,540
but ransomware isn't
necessarily data loss,

761
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,540
but we also know that there
was going to be litigation

762
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,050
because we couldn't meet a contract.

763
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,560
So what do we do?

764
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,790
So we kind of a bit of
a tizzy and we said,

765
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,200
okay, this should really go into legal.

766
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,460
And that's why it came
out of legal funding

767
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,430
and that's why I was handed
over to α, β, and γ to lead.

768
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,930
- And weren't you also
concerned that your numbers

769
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,649
were already over budget and you knew

770
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,180
that having the forensic response

771
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,810
come out of the cyber budget would put you

772
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,120
even further in the red?

773
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,930
- Well, I was certainly
concerned with my numbers,

774
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,870
but I was much more
concerned with the fact that

775
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,240
I had just had the company
shut down six weeks

776
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,073
with my things.

777
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:56,650
So when you're looking at the problem,

778
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,270
yes, it was a problem, but
not as big as a problem

779
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,610
of the fact that we lost six weeks.

780
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,670
- Ms. Doss, I'll remind you of your time.

781
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,340
- Yep, just one further question.

782
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,340
So isn't it the case that
some of the deficiencies

783
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,350
that were found in the security assessment

784
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,610
were relevant in the
penetration that resulted

785
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,203
in this ransomware attack?

786
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,009
- Yes, we didn't catch everything.

787
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,958
That's true.

788
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:20,840
I mean, that's the problem.

789
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,210
I mean, if someone gets into your system,

790
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,623
it's clearly your fault.

791
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,853
- Thank you, your honor.

792
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:27,710
No further questions.

793
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,640
- All right, thanks to the
witnesses who are excused.

794
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,708
Counsel, you each have about three minutes

795
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,260
to make closing remarks.

796
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,870
Let's begin, I think because it's,

797
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,109
I think we'll begin with Ms.
Peretti since it's her burden.

798
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,310
- You honor, the communications related to

799
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,720
and materials generated from
the ransomware investigation,

800
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,209
including the forensics
report should be protected

801
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,930
from disclosure for the following reasons.

802
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,109
First, they are protected

803
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,260
because of the attorney client privilege.

804
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,030
As we see from cases that touchstone

805
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,170
for the attorney client privilege

806
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,120
is whether there's a
confidential communication

807
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,259
and that communication
was made for the purpose

808
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,700
of rendering legal advice.

809
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,049
Here, we have fact witnesses
say that communications

810
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,640
were confidential and that
the materials were provided

811
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,379
for the primary purpose
of rendering legal advice

812
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,960
for Dolls-R-Us including

813
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
whether state data breach
notification statutes

814
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,140
may have been implicated,
whether paying the criminals

815
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,569
may have been prohibited
by OFAC regulations,

816
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,240
whether the event was
material, whether contracts

817
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,310
could have been breached
causing litigation,

818
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,380
counsel must be involved
in leading and directing

819
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,070
the investigation at
every juncture in order

820
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,650
to assess these risks.

821
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,960
- But can you tell me why the lawyers

822
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,210
had to have the technical analysis

823
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,773
to provide the legal advice?

824
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,080
Was it really necessary?

825
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,600
- Pursuant to [Inaudible],
they need third-party agents

826
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,940
to help translate and
understand the technical facts,

827
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,560
which implicate the legal risks.

828
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,060
So those technical
facts help us understand

829
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,890
what deficiencies occurred,
what reasonable security

830
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,020
was in place, whether
certain systems were accessed

831
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,960
and may have had data compromised on them.

832
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,170
So they helped us in
rendering legal advice

833
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,330
to the organization.

834
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,674
- The Dolls-R-Us have any
other source of information

835
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:10,150
to allow it to take remedial action

836
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,033
besides this forensic investigation?

837
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:15,710
- No, this forensic investigation

838
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,700
allowed it to understand
how the criminals got in.

839
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,700
So it was very important for
us to both render legal advice

840
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,490
with respect to the incident, as well as,

841
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,040
there can be dual purposes
to investigations.

842
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,610
There's always gonna be
some fallout related to

843
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,150
how to do certain remediation,

844
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,070
but they were very, very careful
to not share that exactly,

845
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,090
with the technical team that needed to do

846
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,640
some of the corrective actions,

847
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,440
but the primary purpose here
was to help instruct lawyers

848
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,020
in rendering legal advice.

849
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,780
- Okay, so about 15 seconds to wrap up

850
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,480
and then we'll hear from Ms. Doss.

851
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,622
- Okay, I also wanted to
emphasize that there was

852
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:01,129
a tightly held information on the report.

853
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,280
It came from legal, the legal budget,

854
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,140
there was a legal purpose to
both the privilege purposes,

855
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,593
as well as the attorney client
and work product privilege.

856
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,500
And importantly that the investigator here

857
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,730
was engaged in a very
different scope of services

858
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,990
in its prior relationship,
there was no existing retainer

859
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,560
to do incident response
with this particular group.

860
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,470
It was the first time they were engaged

861
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,439
to do incident response,
and it was by council.

862
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,952
- Okay, good, thank you
very much, Ms. Doss.

863
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:33,263
- Thank you, your honor.

864
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
First I would draw the court's attention

865
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,750
to the legal standard
here as was made clear

866
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,023
by this court in previous rulings.

867
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,560
Courts generally disfavor assertions

868
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,913
of evidentiary privileges
that could result, excuse me.

869
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,853
Courts disfavor assertions
of evidentiary privileges

870
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:58,180
because they shield evidence
from the truth seeking process.

871
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,569
As such, those privileges
are to be narrowly

872
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,210
and strictly construed,

873
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,340
so they are confined to the
narrowest possible limits,

874
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,420
consistent with the
logic of its principle.

875
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,740
We've seen course uphold that
principle time and again,

876
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,390
we saw it most in the
Capital One decision.

877
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,650
And what counsel for
Dolls-R-Us is asking us to do

878
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,100
is to fly in the face of that standard.

879
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,230
In this instance, there was
a preexisting relationship

880
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,830
between Technotronic and Dolls-R-Us.

881
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,529
Technotronic had done work,
gotten to know the system,

882
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,410
created a security assessment,

883
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,758
which revealed issues that
were left unremediated

884
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:37,482
and led to this ransomware that
caused injury to my client.

885
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,810
Because of that existing relationship,

886
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,020
Mr. Kesterson said to Technotronic,

887
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,070
we're gonna recommend you to counsel,

888
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,490
counsel brought in
Technotronic, Mr. Kesterson went

889
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,950
to the insurance company and
said we want them on our panel.

890
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,549
It is clear that it was
the company, Dolls-R-Us,

891
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,360
that valued this relationship.

892
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,620
There's nothing wrong with
valuing that relationship,

893
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,009
but there is a stream of work here.

894
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,860
We can't view the forensic
work in isolation.

895
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,220
Even if we could view the
forensic work in isolation,

896
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,040
it's clear that the Technotronic didn't.

897
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,900
We have testimony from
Julie Lewis at Technotronic

898
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,820
that in fact, the two teams collaborated,

899
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,580
they talked with each other to understand

900
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,660
what they were looking for,
what they were looking at.

901
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,430
We have testimony from Mr.Kesterson

902
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,537
indicating that under Dolls-R-Us' own IRP,

903
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,950
the forensic report would
have been done in any event.

904
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,290
Counsel for Dolls-R-Us is
pointing to the legal work

905
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,700
that of course counsel has to do.

906
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,210
Yes, of course counsel has to advise

907
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,330
on any potential regulatory
obligations and so forth.

908
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,750
None of that is contained
in the forensic report.

909
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,590
That's contained in counsel's own work

910
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,780
and counsel's own advice to the client.

911
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,030
The forensic report was
written by Technotronic.

912
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,170
We believe it contains
information that draws

913
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,470
that straight line from
the security assessment

914
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,169
to the breach, to the scope
and extent of the compromise

915
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,130
that has injured our client.

916
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,620
We can't see that
information if it is shielded

917
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,980
behind privilege.

918
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,080
We know from Mr. Kesterson
that they're frankly who paid

919
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,700
out of which budget, and Dolls-R-Us

920
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,250
was a little bit of a fiction.

921
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,369
He was over budget, it all
comes out of the same pot.

922
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:19,170
And as he said, you know what,
if Dolls-R-Us has a breach,

923
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,840
if they don't secure their
systems, it's their fault.

924
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,070
Once again, counsel for Dolls-R-Us

925
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,170
has an extraordinarily high burden,

926
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,720
counsel for Dolls-R-Us must
demonstrate that not only

927
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,439
did Dolls-R-Us know that this
could result in litigation,

928
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,550
but also that the work product
would not have been prepared

929
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,810
in substantially similar
form, but for the prospect

930
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,630
of that litigation.

931
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,583
- Let me ask you one question

932
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,570
because you're about out of time.

933
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,020
So maybe you could take
15 seconds to answer this.

934
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,020
Under what set of circumstances
in a post breach analysis

935
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,940
of the weaknesses that led to the breach

936
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,260
would a forensic report be work product

937
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,430
under your theory of the law?

938
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,430
- Well, potentially if it
had been two different firms,

939
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,740
if the two firms hadn't
collaborated with each other,

940
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,209
hadn't conversed with each other,

941
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,530
hadn't consulted with each other.

942
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:21,190
But in this instance,
we know it's the company

943
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,873
that did the security assessment,

944
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,210
provided some recommendations
that apparently

945
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,410
weren't all followed.

946
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,279
There was a breach that resulted,

947
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,290
the same company had
two teams that consulted

948
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,980
with each other to do
the forensics report.

949
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,580
And that's what we're fighting over here.

950
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,360
So there's many scenarios
where those facts

951
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,860
would not converge.

952
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,830
- All right, does anybody,
so we had a lot of

953
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,480
heated discussion from the
lawyers and we were trying

954
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,480
to keep things on a tight path
to get through the testimony.

955
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,080
I think you guys did a great
job illuminating the facts

956
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,180
through the witnesses.

957
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,990
April or Kim, is there something

958
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,529
that you would have liked to
say from a legal perspective

959
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,860
of why the case law supports your position

960
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,440
that you didn't get a chance to say

961
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,241
because you were cut off
in the last a minute or so,

962
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:14,063
a couple minutes of your closing remarks?

963
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,120
- Yeah, I would.

964
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,259
I mean, there's been several cases now,

965
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,130
Premera, Dominion, Dental, Cap One,

966
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,090
and the courts really are
focused on that statement of work

967
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:31,340
and whether there was a
previous similar engagement

968
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,660
with the forensic firm
because a lot of times

969
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,660
these forensics firms get
hired by companies repeatedly

970
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,020
and sometimes just by the company

971
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,720
and then sometimes by outside counsel.

972
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,640
So when the courts have seen
the same scope of services

973
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,480
happen earlier in an engagement
for incident response

974
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,870
and then a subsequent one
where they're hired by counsel,

975
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,580
often, that's very determinative for them

976
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,900
in their conclusion that
the subsequent engagement

977
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,673
has the same scope of
services so it's also,

978
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,109
it's a business investigation rather than

979
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,830
for a legal purpose or in
anticipation of litigation.

980
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,880
- All right, so Kim, that was helpful.

981
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,630
April, anything that you
wanted to add to that

982
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,288
or that you want it to say

983
00:47:22,288 --> 00:47:24,020
and you didn't have a chance to say.

984
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,790
- Yeah, nothing in
particular I would have added

985
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,960
in the scope of the argument itself,

986
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,930
but I would just, to add to
some of opposing counsel's

987
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,040
comments on the landscape of the law,

988
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,490
one of the things that's
a challenge here is that

989
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,530
it's so common for a forensic
vendor to be on a retainer

990
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,250
in advance of an incident happening

991
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,010
and in the face of good policy reasons

992
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,220
for encouraging that to be done

993
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,970
at the traditional work product analysis

994
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,140
is a bit of a challenge.

995
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,240
And if it were not so difficult

996
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,959
to get around attorney
client privilege issues

997
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,360
in a line of questioning about exactly

998
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,850
how much counsel really
directed that forensic report,

999
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,799
that would certainly be
an area that as counsel

1000
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,326
for the plaintiff I would
have wanted to pursue

1001
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:18,890
because candidly in
many incident response,

1002
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,830
there can be wide variation
in how much counsel

1003
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,600
truly directs the
investigation that's done

1004
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,815
by the forensics firm and
how much counsel ever been

1005
00:48:27,815 --> 00:48:29,670
or works with them is keeping an eye

1006
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,100
on the legal ramifications,

1007
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,790
but certainly not directing
the technical work

1008
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,440
in many instances.

1009
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,050
But that's a hard line of
questioning to go down.

1010
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,893
- Right, that's a great observation.

1011
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,773
And do you think it's better practice?

1012
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,000
If you think of it as this is a shorthand,

1013
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,470
but if you think it is
fact product as opposed

1014
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,649
to work product and any
forensic report probably

1015
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,610
has at least some
component of work product,

1016
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,610
opinion work product,
directed work product,

1017
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,700
and there's probably got to be part of it.

1018
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,230
Is there really an upside
for it to have two reports?

1019
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,793
Because what does it
matter anyway at the end

1020
00:49:08,793 --> 00:49:11,420
if you get a reasonable
forensic investigation

1021
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,420
that you need to make sure
you do your remediation

1022
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,060
for a business purpose that
you would have to do anyway,

1023
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,350
what's the strategy here?

1024
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,270
Do you have any comments
on that from the lawyers?

1025
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,276
Is it?

1026
00:49:21,276 --> 00:49:22,383
That's the business question.

1027
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,583
Or it's a business/litigation question.

1028
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:28,449
Do you have a view of what you think

1029
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:29,800
is the best better practice?

1030
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,620
- No, I think it's challenging because-

1031
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,440
- 'Cause either way you're
producing information

1032
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,710
and you're probably not gonna
hide the fact information

1033
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,240
by having a directed by an attorney,

1034
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,656
you're just not, right?

1035
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:45,734
- That's right.

1036
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:47,380
- So I think that's the answer.

1037
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,213
- Yeah.

1038
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,370
- Good, well with that,
any concluding observations

1039
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,330
from our, one last chance for
someone from the audience,

1040
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,730
we have about a minute left.

1041
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,883
Let's see, we have somebody
just said something, sorry.

1042
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,450
So in the panel in the morning,

1043
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,140
the speaker suggested
having a two tech approach

1044
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,790
conducting an investigation
for business purposes

1045
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,490
and one for forensic purposes.

1046
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,069
That was really, that was the
question or the observation.

1047
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,060
And that was what I was asking is,

1048
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,049
is there really a strategic
upside for doing that?

1049
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,700
Because at the end of
the day, the business,

1050
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,129
it's interesting, you would certainly,

1051
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,080
you might have a better shot at insulating

1052
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,580
the report prepared for
litigation purposes,

1053
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,540
maybe the two that you track report,

1054
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,350
what do you really gain by it?

1055
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,630
I think that's what I was trying to say

1056
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,710
rather than inexpertly,

1057
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,060
because you have to do
the forensic investigation

1058
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,880
to remediate and to mitigate
and to therefore reduce risk.

1059
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,440
And that has both a business purpose

1060
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,540
and a litigation purpose.

1061
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,350
So my question was, doesn't
really matter at the end?

1062
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,350
You're gonna have to
give out the information

1063
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,577
that's fact information
and investigations.

1064
00:50:57,577 --> 00:50:59,770
And we all know this there's
a good way and a bad way

1065
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,790
to do investigations, but investigations

1066
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,310
that are done right are spendy.

1067
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,480
So that's another issue.

1068
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,730
So with that, I'm gonna look at our time

1069
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,580
and I think we're at
time unless someone wants

1070
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,413
to correct me.

1071
00:51:10,413 --> 00:51:12,140
So thank you everybody
for your attention today.

1072
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,589
It was nice to see everybody.

1073
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:15,780
(alarm chimes)

1074
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,880
And look, that's my alarm.

1075
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,713
(Laurel laughs)

1076
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:19,683
Hoyt, last word to you.

1077
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,360
- Nop, I think we're all good.

1078
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,193
- All right.

1079
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:24,026
- It's tough to do something like this

1080
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:26,002
in a short amount of time,
but everyone did wonderfully.

1081
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,000
(Laurel laughs)

1082
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,530
- You just speeded your
voice up, that was cute.

1083
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,830
All right, thank you guys.
