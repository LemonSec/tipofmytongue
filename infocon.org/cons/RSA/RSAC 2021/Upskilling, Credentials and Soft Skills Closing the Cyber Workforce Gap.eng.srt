1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,223
- Good day.

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:03,239
My name is John Brandt,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,680
Information Security
Professional Practices Lead

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,883
here at ISACA.

5
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:09,090
I would like to welcome all

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,200
of our conference participants today

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,850
to today's session titled
Upskilling, Credentials

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,890
and Soft Skills: Closing
the Cyber Workforce Gap.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,870
Today I'm joined by my
two esteem panelists,

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,740
Caitlin McGaw and Greg Touhill.

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,200
Caitlin would you like to
introduce yourself please?

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,910
- Hi, I'm Caitlin McGaw,

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,180
CEO and founder of Candor McGaw,

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,600
an executive Search and
Career Management Practice

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,723
for IT audit cybersecurity
and IT GRC professionals.

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,843
- Greg.

17
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:41,747
- Hello everyone.

18
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:42,580
I'm Greg Touhill.

19
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,120
I am a board director at ISACA.

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,870
I'm also in my day job,

21
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,919
I'm the Director of the CERT Division

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,240
at the Software Engineering Institute

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,450
at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,900
And previously I served as the president

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,960
of AppGate FederaL,

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,800
a cybersecurity and advanced
technologies company.

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,350
And before that I was the Chief
Information Security Officer

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,850
of the United States government.

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,292
And I'm looking forward
to our conversation today.

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,493
- Thank you very much.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,200
I wanna begin this morning

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,510
by sharing new research from ISACA

33
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,630
that measures where we
are with the current state

34
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,619
of the cybersecurity workforce.

35
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,430
Particularly the skills gaps,

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,600
the higher managers are noticing

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,479
and the long time it
takes to hire open roles

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,623
in those cybersecurity teams.

39
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,800
ISACA's 2021 state of cybersecurity

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,560
was released this week
in conjunction per say.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,910
This annual research is
released in two parts.

42
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,800
The first examines the
cybersecurity workforce

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,520
and the second, which will
be released this summer,

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,270
looks at the threat landscape

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,250
and current trends in
combating cyber attacks.

46
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,220
More than 3,600 cybersecurity
leaders participated

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,480
in this year's annual survey

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,170
which represents our largest response

49
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,950
and 44% over last year.

50
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,960
We found that it's recorded each year,

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,910
there are mains challenges

52
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,150
in finding qualified
well-rounded candidates.

53
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,430
Research also shows

54
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,500
that understaffed teams
remain strongly correlated

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,443
to an increasing number of cyber attacks.

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,220
Despite years of effort
by industry, government

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,880
and academia and many taxpayer dollars

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,290
to develop a stronger pipeline

59
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,382
of cybersecurity candidates,
little has changed.

60
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,910
One problem remains that

61
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,190
while cybersecurity
jobs are in high demand,

62
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,446
few organizations offer
entry-level opportunities

63
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:43,740
leaving few entry points into the field.

64
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,840
How can we once and for all

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,130
begin making a significant impact

66
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,912
to the ongoing skills gap.

67
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,670
Before we begin discussing these gaps

68
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,109
and possible solutions,

69
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,340
I wanna briefly share some responses

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,140
that ISACA received

71
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,183
to its 2020 State of Cybersecurity Survey.

72
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,440
With this particular question here,

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,270
how would you describe
your current staffing

74
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,980
of your organization's cybersecurity team?

75
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,109
61% say that their cybersecurity
teams are understaffed.

76
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,770
14% saying significantly.

77
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,590
Only 34% say that their teams
are appropriately staffed.

78
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,121
Of interest here that
although that number is low,

79
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,980
it does represent a slight uptake

80
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,803
from last year of 3% points.

81
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,890
Does your organization have unfilled

82
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,029
or open cybersecurity positions?

83
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,660
And more than half of respondents say

84
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,770
that their team still
has unfilled positions.

85
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,400
And this is just a growing trend

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,820
that continues year after
year and really a pain point

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,813
for everyone who is involved,
trying to make a difference.

88
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,816
On average, how long does
it take your organization

89
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:01,563
to fill a cybersecurity position
with a qualified candidate?

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,019
In one glimmer in good
news, only 16% reported

91
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,500
it takes longer than six months

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,100
to fill an open cybersecurity position

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,049
in 2020, 29%...

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,709
last reported that it takes
longer than six months.

95
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,120
However the three to six month timeframe

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,100
is still very prevalent and increasing.

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,100
In 2020, 30% had said it did
take take three to six months

98
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,623
which represents a double-digit
gain from the year prior.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
On average, how many
cybersecurity applicants

100
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,500
are well-qualified for the position

101
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,693
which they're applying?

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,280
50% of those generally
surveyed do not believe

103
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,299
their applicants are well-qualified.

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,158
It can be pretty disheartening
to be a hiring manager

105
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,900
and feel that only 6%

106
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,760
of the applications you
receive are from qualified

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,140
or are from candidates
who are fully qualified

108
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,590
for that role.

109
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,630
Two more data points to add

110
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,030
that are on the side are that only 27% say

111
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,729
that recent university
graduates are well prepared

112
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,180
for cybersecurity challenges

113
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,470
that the organizations are facing.

114
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,710
And only 31% say that their
HR teams regularly understand

115
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,763
their hiring needs.

116
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,750
What are the biggest skills gaps you see

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,260
in today's cybersecurity professionals?

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,940
While technical skills
remain in highest demand,

119
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,918
employers are seeking
well-rounded candidates

120
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,630
with solid soft skills.

121
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,460
The biggest skills gaps is shown here

122
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,334
on the screen begin
with soft skills at 56%.

123
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:41,430
And as you'll see,
technical related skills

124
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,600
are a significant distance behind those

125
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,100
and vary everything from
security controls down

126
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,093
to basic IT knowledge.

127
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,570
When we hear that cyber
professionals lack soft skills,

128
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,573
what does generally entail?

129
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,219
I wanna first start with Caitlin

130
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,140
if you would take this question.

131
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,260
- Thanks, Greg.

132
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,599
John, sorry.

133
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,010
I think there are some things that come

134
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,880
up all the time, such as, verbal

135
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,719
and communication skills and writing.

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,660
But things that I hear about particularly

137
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,380
from CSOs is emotional intelligence.

138
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,460
Being able to understand

139
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,729
and manage your own emotions in order

140
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,880
to effectively communicate, empathize

141
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,880
with others as well as resolve conflicts.

142
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,660
And in fact, the CSO

143
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,050
that I was just talking well said

144
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,635
he'd take emotional intelligence any day

145
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,230
over certifications.

146
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,160
Not that certifications
are irrelevant, but just

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,440
that it's so much harder to
train emotional intelligence

148
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,760
and enthusiasm rather than the skill set,

149
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,969
the hard skill set.

150
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,330
And another thing that
comes to mind is resilience

151
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,620
which folds in a lot of
different sorts of attributes,

152
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,003
such as optimism and persistence or grit.

153
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
Continuing to push through
even when you faced challenges,

154
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,539
because gosh, cybersecurity is,

155
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,810
can be a frustrating business.

156
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,310
Things can go terribly wrong

157
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,800
and people have to be able to
sort of get back on the horse

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,870
and get going to solve
those huge problems.

159
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,240
So I would highlight
those two amongst the many

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,923
that we often hear about.

161
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,710
- Thank you very much.

162
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,780
Greg, would you weigh in on this?

163
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,715
- Yeah, I will give a big
amen to Caitlin on that.

164
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:35,716
Having served in a wide
variety of organizations,

165
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,790
for example, at one point I was head

166
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,410
of the Air Force's cyber training programs

167
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,730
and commanded a wing

168
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,730
of 12,000 Airmen as they
were entering their careers.

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,960
But then I've been an
operational commander,

170
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,940
I've led the federal
government's cyber programs

171
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,040
as the Chief Information Security Officer.

172
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,040
And we've seen all of that
with the different environments

173
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,257
that I have been involved with.

174
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:09,840
And that grit and
perseverance, those are things

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,299
that you really need to
nurture with individuals

176
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
and particularly in
the cyber career field.

177
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,810
And our survey shows
that, the demand out there

178
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,980
about 79% are looking

179
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,840
for folks who are individual contributors.

180
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,580
And we say that cyber security
really is a team sport

181
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,059
because you've gotta
work along a wide range

182
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,239
of skillsets in order to

183
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,539
have an effective risk management program

184
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,539
for your cyber environment.

185
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,409
So having those soft skills,

186
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,420
the communications, the empathy,
the grit, the perseverance,

187
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,760
the ability to work as a team.

188
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,420
And it's often a pickup team
based on different situations

189
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,256
and that kind of flexibility
and adaptability,

190
00:08:55,256 --> 00:09:00,256
that's a collection of skills
that leaders need to nurture.

191
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,369
And often you may get a new employee

192
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:09,369
that is not necessarily fully
experienced in those areas

193
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,550
but as a leader, you've gotta help

194
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,640
those folks gain those skills

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
and nurture them along the way.

196
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,230
And it's a twin edged sword

197
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,370
because you're not gonna
really have an opportunity

198
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,650
to find that perfect
employee right off the bat.

199
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,120
Sometimes you're gonna have to say, okay,

200
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
so what skills and attributes I must have

201
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,230
and then where can I grow

202
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,803
that employee into meet
the needs of the team.

203
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,740
- Fantastic responses
and a lot of value there

204
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,220
and things that we've heard before.

205
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,940
Something I didn't hear
mention though in particular

206
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,380
which I, if we could just extend this

207
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,330
for a second here is
critical thinking, right?

208
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,280
In particular, the analytical
data interpretation.

209
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,790
And I think that in
today's modern landscape,

210
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,030
especially with this
emphasis on misinformation

211
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,372
or disinformation, right?

212
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,017
So two questions come to mind for me.

213
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:20,790
One is that the part of
typical job description

214
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,819
that's out there is
typically highly focused

215
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,190
on the technical attributes
you're looking for, right?

216
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,770
And while we've seen
some better men on those

217
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,290
with job posting shrinking in size

218
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,699
and not necessarily
looking for the unicorn

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,423
who's done everything.

220
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,310
It begs, the question is...

221
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,890
Is if soft skills is
remaining the largest gap

222
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,710
there, are employers actually changing

223
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,610
how they're hiring, right?

224
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,000
And what's happening with
regards to the programs,

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,053
the talent pipeline if you will. Caitlin?

226
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:07,240
- Well, I think, let me
address first, you brought up

227
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,730
sort of the job descriptions.

228
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,190
It's interesting that I'm
seeing more job descriptions

229
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,760
that are actually folding
in, bullets around sort

230
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,760
of the soft skill attributes
that companies are looking for.

231
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,120
But I think something that
continues to be problematic is

232
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,740
the search for the purple squirrel.

233
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,820
The aspirational job
description, which tends to rule

234
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,420
out too many people, women in particular,

235
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,180
if they don't see a
really strong correlation

236
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,329
between the skill sets that they possess

237
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,290
and those listed on the job description

238
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,839
will often be discouraged from applying.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,260
And then to Greg's point about management,

240
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,650
I think managers really
absolutely have to understand kind

241
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,600
of what they need in the job

242
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,930
and who can really do it

243
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,609
because there are many ways to expand

244
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,070
that candidate pipeline,

245
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,230
if you think creatively about

246
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,220
what it really takes to do the job

247
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,650
and what could be trained

248
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,300
from a hard skills perspective

249
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,382
with a moderate investment in training.

250
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,130
Greg what do you think?

251
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,663
- I'd like to pile on to that?

252
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
At the end of the day,

253
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,280
there's a couple of
things that I've learned

254
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,800
throughout my professional career.

255
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,810
And one that's really
important is one I learned in

256
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,680
the military where leaders lead people,

257
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
managers manage stuff.

258
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,640
And in the cyber business,
you've got to be both.

259
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,380
You've got to be both
a leader and a manager.

260
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,110
And you can come to the
table with a certain amount

261
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,890
of skills out there, but
you also have to recognize

262
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,240
that you're gonna grow in your skillset

263
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,700
both as a manager of stuff
like processes and procedures

264
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,290
but also leader of people.

265
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,270
And the key thing that
helps folks along the way

266
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,140
and if I'm a hiring authority,

267
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,930
I'm looking for the proper attitude.

268
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,099
And there's lots of different ways

269
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,670
that you can look during
the interview process.

270
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,900
Does this person have the right attitude?

271
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Does he or she have the
ability to go out there

272
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,200
and be dynamic and embrace new challenges?

273
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,540
Do they have a willingness to learn?

274
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,849
Are they eager to better themselves?

275
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,570
All of those things, it's
very difficult in a resume

276
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,780
to push forward those types of things

277
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,930
but candidates can really
posture themselves well

278
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,170
by demonstrating the potential for growth.

279
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,099
The willingness to extend
beyond just the job description

280
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,370
and demonstrate that they're
willing to go out there

281
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,730
and compete well.

282
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,210
Such as going out and
getting certifications

283
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,260
from ISACA or other organizations

284
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,220
to prove not only their ability
to expand their horizons

285
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,030
and demonstrate their technical powers

286
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,209
but also to go above and beyond.

287
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:14,210
And attitude will always
trump the paper route.

288
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,089
So as a hiring authority

289
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,017
and somebody who's hired a lot of folks

290
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,350
and had to recruit a lot of folks.

291
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,685
I'm looking for folks that
are showing me the potential

292
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:27,939
to do even more than what
they've done in the past.

293
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,170
And I can go and I can teach
you how to be a better leader.

294
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,620
I can teach you how to be a better manager

295
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,320
but I can't teach you to
have a positive attitude.

296
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,690
I can help just to emulate that

297
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,290
and I can show you the way.

298
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,230
So as we're recruiting, we're looking

299
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,070
for that person who is
demonstrating the potential

300
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,933
to learn and grow.

301
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,463
- You know, if I can
add just one more thing.

302
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,699
I think that those are excellent points.

303
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,690
And to that, it's on the
candidate side to sort

304
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,430
of demonstrate their skillset

305
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,609
and to bring those stories
about their good works

306
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,070
and their attributes forward.

307
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,370
But it's also on hiring leaders

308
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,470
and Greg you strike me
as an exemplary one,

309
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,850
you actually try and help people,

310
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,780
but I've seen so many hiring leaders

311
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,050
in my professional practice

312
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,530
who just simply aren't good interviewers.

313
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,850
And maybe more comfortable
interviewing candidates

314
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,600
around the technical skills,

315
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,030
but in fact aren't very
thoughtful at times

316
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,890
about the questions they could ask

317
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,730
and the listening they
could do around sort

318
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,780
of the soft skills and the traits

319
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,430
that the candidates might bring forward

320
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,339
if they were asked other
sorts of questions.

321
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,749
So just to kind of put that
out there to hiring leaders

322
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,490
to also really think about
the questions they're asking

323
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,600
and what they're listening for.

324
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,910
- Yeah and let me go to one more pile on

325
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,963
before we hand back to John.

326
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm actually looking for folks

327
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,700
that provide me diversity, equity

328
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,870
and inclusion in my workforce.

329
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,109
And for those folks who feel like,

330
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm under qualified for certain portions

331
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,710
of this particular job.

332
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,680
If you've got the hard skills

333
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,420
and you can contribute
as part of that team,

334
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,670
I still wanna hear from you.

335
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,120
I still want you to apply

336
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,480
for those types of jobs and
go through that process.

337
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,910
And don't be deterred just

338
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,110
because you may not have 100%

339
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,870
of all the skills I'm looking for.

340
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,470
So for our audience members

341
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,900
who have looked at jobs and said,

342
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,459
hey, I don't meet 100%,
so I'm not going to apply

343
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,560
or I'm not probably the
right person for this.

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,770
Let me as the hiring authority
be the decider on that.

345
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,960
Tell me what you bring to the table.

346
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
And the best thing you can do
is not sell yourself short.

347
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,350
I can teach you a whole lot.

348
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm looking for somebody
who has potential to grow.

349
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,810
And a lot of my peers are out
there thinking the same way

350
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,760
because it's a challenging
market for hiring.

351
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,840
And I don't wanna necessarily
wait for six months

352
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,569
or four months to get
somebody who's perfect.

353
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,899
I'm willing to get somebody in there

354
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,150
who can hit the ground running

355
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,079
and deliver some capability,

356
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,899
but really can grow to that 100%.

357
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,800
Back to you, John.

358
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:20,599
- Those are two outstanding perspectives.

359
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,419
And I think that I would
just add on to that, right?

360
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,750
To wrap up this point before we open it

361
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,510
to our first opportunity for questions is

362
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,510
that to recognize that
largely speaking, even today

363
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
that the workforce represents
a million of people

364
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,827
who just took different journeys, right?

365
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,140
And some of the best analysts

366
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,120
out there didn't come up through

367
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,080
what would, someone would coin

368
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,020
the perfect technical
pipeline or whatnot, right?

369
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,280
Because they look at problems differently

370
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,470
and I believe speaks to
both what you had said.

371
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,010
And at this time we'll
open up for questions

372
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,523
from the audience specifically
related to soft skills.

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Okay, we're gonna advance.

374
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,380
Well soft skills are a
great asset to be able

375
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,170
to communicate and lead.

376
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,990
Critical thinking skills are also required

377
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,990
to be successful in cybersecurity roles.

378
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,780
What are some of the hard skills

379
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,270
that a cybersecurity
professional needs to pair

380
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,629
with these softer skills?

381
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,660
We had touched on these briefly, right?

382
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,530
I had introduced it previously
when we had just talked

383
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,550
about a critical thinking
there, but really taken it.

384
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,580
And we're focusing specifically on

385
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,540
those hard skills related
to cybersecurity profession

386
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,450
which, well for a level setting, right?

387
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,480
Is very broad.

388
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,460
If they could be SOC related jobs,

389
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,490
they could be pen testing.

390
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,210
It could be on the
compliance in governance side

391
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,550
of things.

392
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,513
Greg, we'll start with you on this one.

393
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,543
- Well, thanks John.

394
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:06,129
As we take a look at the types of skills

395
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,493
that folks in our sector are looking for.

396
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,030
During my military career, I
was involved in both education

397
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,990
and training.

398
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,610
And we defined education
differently than training.

399
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,639
Training focuses on how
to do certain things

400
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
but education focuses
on understanding the why

401
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,630
and being able to integrate
the two is the acne of skill.

402
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,140
And when we are looking
to bring folks on board

403
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,530
into our cybersecurity
organizations, typically

404
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,389
it's very easy to gauge levels

405
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,057
of accomplishment on the how.

406
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:53,057
The hard skills, the search,
the demonstrated capabilities

407
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,040
that have been illustrated
in their resumes based

408
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,399
upon certifications and accreditations

409
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,760
that the individuals have.

410
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,410
Some organizations including the military

411
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,260
here in the United
States are actually doing

412
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,640
what I called the last Starfighter tests.

413
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,370
Where they're actually doing
hands-on demonstrations

414
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,879
of capabilities.

415
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,170
And I think that's way cool

416
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,220
and we need to keep on doing that.

417
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,310
But on the soft skills, those things

418
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,760
that we're also looking
for, we are looking

419
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,720
for folks who have the
ability to communicate well,

420
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,830
orally, in writing, in email

421
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,149
and be able to give briefings

422
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,470
and be able to articulate themselves well

423
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,230
because that helps build better teams.

424
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,280
So we're looking for skills like that.

425
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,710
We are in fact, looking for folks

426
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,570
who are able integrate themselves

427
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,710
into very inclusive teams,

428
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,380
because if you're going in
like in an incident response

429
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,070
to a cyber event, you're gonna roll in

430
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,040
with a database administrator,
a network administrator,

431
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,530
generally somebody from
the supervisory team

432
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,010
who's gonna choreograph activities.

433
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,270
And you're gonna have other specialists

434
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,230
who come in often as
part of the ad hoc teams.

435
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,130
So we're looking for folks
who can integrate well as part

436
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,130
of teams and generally be
very flexible and adaptive.

437
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,970
So as audience members, if
you're building out your resume

438
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,790
and you're looking to
position yourself well

439
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,790
for a cybersecurity position,
consider putting in examples

440
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:41,250
of how your education has prepped you

441
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,810
with certain skills and abilities.

442
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,360
How you, even if you're
an individual contributor,

443
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,919
how you've worked as members of teams.

444
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,180
How you've maybe been involved
in software development

445
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,233
or using software.

446
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:00,180
What kind of coding skills you have?

447
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,270
what kind of languages you speak?

448
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,960
And, Oh, by the way your oral languages

449
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,710
are just as important as
your coding languages.

450
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,570
Because more and more
in a global community

451
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,980
and the internet brings us all together,

452
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,980
having language skills that
go orally, as well as coding.

453
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,490
Boy, you can write your own ticket.

454
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,260
So it's an exciting time.

455
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,510
And I look forward to hearing what Caitlin

456
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,913
has to say on this as well.

457
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,123
- Thanks, Greg.

458
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,050
I'm just, I wanna dovetail right

459
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,460
into Greg's commentary on the flip side

460
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,940
with hiring leaders, looking to again,

461
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,850
how do you do that effectively in terms

462
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,909
of drawing out the candidate
to hear about their,

463
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,130
how do they think?

464
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,670
How do you get to that?

465
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,490
I used to work with Motorola extensively

466
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,800
for many, many, many years.

467
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,530
And one of the things that impressed me

468
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,960
about their hiring process was the fact

469
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,270
that they would bring in professionals

470
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,520
and have them do a case study.

471
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,040
They get 30 minutes to prep
it, write down your notes

472
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,420
and then 30 minutes to
present it to a hiring leader

473
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,227
who kind of listens and walks through it

474
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:11,820
and it has a dialogue.

475
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,899
And what you see from that is kind of

476
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,210
how did this person
approach problem solving?

477
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,930
And one of the things
that was interesting now

478
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,780
this was particularly an audit
and I'll just speak to that.

479
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,590
But they would take a
financial operational leader

480
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,159
who knew nothing about computers systems

481
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,000
and give them an IT audit case study.

482
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,370
Why did they do that?

483
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,830
Because not that they want
to stress the candidate out,

484
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,000
but they wanted to see

485
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,300
how did the person
approach problem solving

486
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,780
in a context that they
weren't totally comfortable.

487
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,490
So I think the case
study, short case study

488
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,260
can really give you an
opportunity to dialogue

489
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,610
with candidates in a different way.

490
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,409
So I'm just throw that in as an add on

491
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,960
to Greg's extensive answer
there, which is awesome.

492
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:55,850
- Those are excellent points there.

493
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,659
And I think that when I
hear you both speak here

494
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,900
from both the hiring managers
perspective, as well as,

495
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,824
if you put yourself in the shoes

496
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:08,930
of the candidate is humility
comes to mind, right?

497
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,750
At the end of the day,
Greg great commentary

498
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,740
on education versus training.

499
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,750
And I think that something

500
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,290
that gets lost out there at times, right?

501
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,629
Because first of all, all professions

502
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,680
we're just, you have to embrace this thing

503
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,587
were lifelong learning is
never gonna go away, right?

504
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:31,330
And part of that's gonna
happen professionally.

505
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,870
Some of that happens
personally, based on experiences

506
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,530
and whatnot.

507
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,530
But to recognize, we don't
know what we don't know

508
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,409
but at the same time, I
like the recommendation

509
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,026
of the case studies or whatnot

510
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:51,230
and also involving other
people perhaps in some

511
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,680
of the interview process

512
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,430
or at least to review how
they were previously scripted.

513
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,490
Because some of the, I
think the newer folks

514
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,233
to the industry might have
a different perspective

515
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:07,409
and kind of help shape
those things to really draw

516
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,203
out the best side of candidates.

517
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,250
We're gonna transition
here, real quick here

518
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,203
and focus here specifically, right?

519
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,020
How a cybersecurity student or a candidate

520
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,603
that's transitioning from another field,

521
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,090
are these soft skills something

522
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,867
that can actually...

523
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,940
Do we really think they're gonna learn

524
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,170
them in a university program?

525
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,140
And I'll preface that by saying that,

526
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,810
every program that I've
either been part of

527
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,730
or evaluated, there's
gotta be a selling point

528
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,563
to that, right?

529
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:49,750
What's the value there?

530
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,440
And for cybersecurity, the inclination

531
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,920
is it's gonna be
cybersecurity related things.

532
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,180
But as we've talked about this far

533
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,827
all of these soft skills
are largely important

534
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:06,188
and have we potentially undervalued

535
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:10,773
the general education
components leading to which.

536
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,973
Caitlin?

537
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,530
- Yeah that's a really, really good point.

538
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,290
I was actually, I went
out and they was looking

539
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,639
at various cybersecurity master's programs

540
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,617
and even undergraduate programs

541
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,440
and see CS in preparation for this.

542
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,360
I was actually pretty surprised

543
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,719
that at top universities
in the master's programs,

544
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,390
there wasn't much outside sort
of the hard skills teaching

545
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,960
and the undergraduate
electives in CS still

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,670
aren't necessarily the ones

547
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,140
that are to foster strong
soft skill development.

548
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,140
But, I think well-run
programs should optimally,

549
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,983
if they're going

550
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:54,899
to create well-rounded
security professionals,

551
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,410
be obviously stressing team projects

552
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,520
where people have to learn

553
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,399
to collaborate, negotiates,
solve problems together

554
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:06,439
and involve presenting
and writing the kinds

555
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,720
of reports that industry is looking for.

556
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,050
So I can't speak to that

557
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,399
as any expert around
university programs per say

558
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,260
but it seems that those
things can be taught

559
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,740
if the right components are built in.

560
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,680
But adding to that, on the student side

561
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,170
here you are in this amazing setting.

562
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,550
And gosh, I mean, learning
those soft skill components

563
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,310
can be done through joining
student organizations

564
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,159
where you can take a leadership role

565
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,015
or at least volunteer your
time teaching perhaps,

566
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,560
high school students coding

567
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,480
or teaching computer literacy
out in the community.

568
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,240
And so you build empathy
for learning how to work

569
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,910
with non-technical people.

570
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,300
Listening to their problems

571
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,280
and trying to explain technical stuff

572
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,590
in non-technical terms.

573
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,280
There's just a whole
myriad of opportunities.

574
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,790
One of my favorite information
security leaders told me

575
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,170
that she learned soft skills,

576
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,840
conflict resolution, negotiation

577
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,990
and just understanding people
by working as a bartender

578
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,100
throughout college.

579
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,490
So I think there's that huge opportunity

580
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,730
if you take some customer facing roles

581
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,520
and internships to learn
a tremendous amount

582
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,343
about soft skills that will
augment the university program.

583
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,510
- Yeah and I'll pile on there too.

584
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,593
As we take a look at the ISACA survey,

585
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,750
the data shows that 27% of
the hiring officials say

586
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,190
that the recent university
grads are well-prepared

587
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,290
to do everything that's expected during

588
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,378
their position in their tenure.

589
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:52,929
Nobody expects I think that
when you come right out

590
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,530
of school, you're going to
be ready to hit the ground

591
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,210
to be the master of everything.

592
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,200
You're not gonna be there.

593
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,080
What you have to do is make sure

594
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,199
that you have that well-rounded education.

595
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,450
And it doesn't matter if you're
coming out of high school

596
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,070
or a university program,
you have to be balanced

597
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,909
and we can train you to
do a lot of great skills.

598
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,840
We can also help you be
educated on some other things

599
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,750
that could round you out.

600
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,810
Ultimately though it doesn't
matter if you're coming in

601
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,860
from another career field too

602
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,622
and you're being up-skilled
into the cyber career field,

603
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,300
you need to be balanced

604
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,190
and you should be striving to be somebody

605
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,290
who works not only within
your job description

606
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,420
but being to branch out well
beyond that job description.

607
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,950
And a lot of the things that Caitlin

608
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,946
was saying just resonates extremely well

609
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:52,689
for me in my professional career.

610
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,210
We're looking for people who can think

611
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,790
and move quickly on their feet
and are adaptable to change.

612
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,790
If there's one thing about the cyber world

613
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,330
is change is inevitable and the job

614
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,560
that you'll have in five
years, you'll be inventing.

615
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,960
It hasn't been invented yet.

616
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,010
- Fantastic points by the both of you.

617
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,060
This is a great transition here.

618
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,760
So we talked about the
flexibility and the grit.

619
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,610
So we're focus here for a few minutes here

620
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,832
on upskilling teams in
elevating your staff, right?

621
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,900
Which seems to be increasing based

622
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,410
on the respondent data here is you

623
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,220
have these trusted, you
know, corporate resources.

624
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,780
You know what they are

625
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,950
but how do you then teach them, right?

626
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,800
Those hard skills is we've
heard from both of you

627
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,990
and I've done it as well
is all those intangibles

628
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,230
that you bring that to the table.

629
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,380
I could teach you to do most things.

630
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,090
Now arguably maybe the glide
slope is a little longer

631
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,100
in some cases, depending on the aspect.

632
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,060
So from your perspectives,

633
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,129
what positions at an enterprise

634
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,193
or a natural transition
into cybersecurity?

635
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,333
Greg?

636
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,560
- Well, I found during
my professional career,

637
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,040
there's several different positions where

638
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,180
I have seen folks successfully transition.

639
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,180
And the organization that I
saw the best transition were

640
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,478
from the Air Force security police people.

641
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:35,660
The folks that were
manning the flight line

642
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,540
and guarding the airplanes

643
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,460
but when they hit the staff Sergeant level

644
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,020
they came eligible for cross training.

645
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,550
Some of the smartest cyber
pros that I've ever worked

646
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,263
with were former Air Force
security police officers.

647
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,149
I've also had folks who

648
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,260
were in the information
management career field,

649
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,950
administrative staff.

650
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,710
They understood the processes

651
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,980
and the procedures, the
culture, the language

652
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,520
of the business,

653
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,450
but then when we layered
on technical skills,

654
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,450
they made a seamless transition
into the cyber career field.

655
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,100
And I had one lady, she was exceptional.

656
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,959
And when she ultimately
retired, she was one

657
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,960
of the government's most senior
cybersecurity professionals.

658
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,580
And she started out as an
intern clerk, worked her way

659
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,580
up to secretary and then
just exploded up the chain

660
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,830
as she got technical skills
added to the repertoire

661
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,480
she brought to the table.

662
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,480
So as long as you understand
the culture of organizations,

663
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,790
we can teach you the technology.

664
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,470
And we've seen folks from
multiple career fields

665
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,250
make the pivot into cyber
and do so extremely well

666
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,480
and auditors and controllers.

667
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,430
I'm seeing more and more
folks in the auditor

668
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,370
and the accounting fields,
making the pivot as well

669
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,010
because they've spent
so much time analyzing

670
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,820
and doing all of the
business process analysis.

671
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,963
Once we pair them with the
technical skills, look out.

672
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,407
Fantastic. Well we're
running short on time.

673
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:18,419
So I have one last question here

674
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,950
and I'm gonna leave this...

675
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,840
I'll put this out to you, Caitlin.

676
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,959
How do we expand the net so

677
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,650
we are attracting more diverse candidates?

678
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,260
- Yeah I think there's some
really important pieces there.

679
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,129
First. I think just from the
get-go, being willing to look

680
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,820
at people that fit the need,

681
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,919
what really needs to get done in the job

682
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,350
and where can that person come from?

683
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,939
I mean, beyond, I mean, IT audit,

684
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,750
IT crime justice, military.

685
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,927
I was gonna pile onto
Greg's commentary there.

686
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:56,219
One of my best people who's moved

687
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,440
into security actually came

688
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,970
from a Navy mission logistics role

689
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,060
and he had brilliant skills to transfer.

690
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,649
But within the organization,
if you think broadly,

691
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,389
there are people that have the
soft skills, the creativity

692
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,746
the analytical skills to
move into cybersecurity

693
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,420
if they're offered the training

694
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,929
and those people could
come from risk management,

695
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,710
they could come from marketing,

696
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,550
they could come from public relations.

697
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,510
The hard parts, the hard side

698
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,370
of marketing is entirely
analytically oriented

699
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,179
and looking for anomalies
and things that stand out

700
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,540
and patterns that should be absorbed

701
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,476
and recognized as well as the writing

702
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:37,159
and the speaking skills.

703
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,112
But engineering and as I
mentioned, logistics are all places

704
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,469
that people can come from.

705
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:44,239
But the key thing is to
have a welcoming culture.

706
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,449
I mean, from the start
of outreach to candidates

707
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,909
and especially if you're
trying to recruit them

708
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,000
into security from other areas and working

709
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,920
with diverse populations as well,

710
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,770
that are underrepresented in security,

711
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,360
the process from the first outreach

712
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,370
through the recruiting,
interviewing, onboarding

713
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,109
to the day-to-day work, the culture

714
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,280
of the team has to be
welcoming and accepting.

715
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,000
And I just can't stress that enough.

716
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,850
But I think also a couple
of things is you've got to

717
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,460
get the better job description so

718
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,340
that you don't discourage
people from applying.

719
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,930
You have to have hiring managers

720
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,379
who are thinking more broadly.

721
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,330
So I think those would be some

722
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,799
of the points I would put in there.

723
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,230
- Thank you very much, Caitlin.

724
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,710
So as we wrap up here.

725
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,463
key takeaways from the presentation.

726
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,319
These are, nothing here is hard and fast.

727
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,090
I think I'm hoping that
this panel discussion

728
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,400
was thought provoking

729
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,490
and really meet hiring managers

730
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,439
and candidates alike or
prospective candidates, right?

731
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,500
Because you know people continue to move

732
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,541
within the industry.

733
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,740
The catalog, what it is you're asking for

734
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,379
and what it is that you
bring to a particular job

735
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,563
or what you might need there.

736
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,150
Surely expanded criteria
is been a common theme.

737
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,680
We've looked at looking at non-cyber staff

738
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,669
that already understand
a corporate culture

739
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,283
which just there's a lot of value there.

740
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,450
Something we didn't get a chance

741
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,259
to touch on here, training programs.

742
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,170
ISACA offers a wide range

743
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,700
of opportunities from new entry points up

744
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,700
to your mid level and
executive level folks.

745
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,040
With that, I will open it up to

746
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,317
for more questions for our panelists.
