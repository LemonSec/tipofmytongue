00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,550
- Welcome to Public
Health Cyber War Games.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,730
How Hackers Are Exploding Healthcare.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,210
My name is Caleb Barlow and
I'm the CEO of CynergisTec.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,020
We're a services organization
with a large practice

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,950
in healthcare security and privacy

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,530
operating in about 1,000 hospitals.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm joined today by Robin Ford.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,400
Robin, please introduce yourself.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
- Hi, my name is Robin Ford.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,900
I'm the manager of
Information Systems Security

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,130
at Palomar Health.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,560
I have over 15 years of
combined information technology

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,210
and cybersecurity experience

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,150
and over 30 years
experience in healthcare.

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,300
- So in today's session, we're gonna start

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,830
by baseline the current
situation in healthcare

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,230
with a specific focus
on the kinetic impact

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,940
that ransomware is having on patient care.

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,070
We'll look at several recent breaches

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,830
and give you some insights,

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,320
not only to what has been
captured in the press

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,890
but also what's actually
going on inside a hospital

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,210
from both a business and
a clinical perspective

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,120
when a hospital loses access

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,290
to their electronic medical records

26
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,440
we're then gonna switch
gears and talk about

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
the new threats in healthcare.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
From attempted attacks on the cold chain

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,120
and vaccine production to genomic testing

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,400
and the concerns over how we secure it.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,050
We'll end with a focus on actions

32
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,940
that you can take away and lessons learned

33
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,830
throughout the pandemic
that could be applied

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,840
to any institution, not only healthcare.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,480
So let's start with this situation report.

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,870
The threat in the healthcare is no longer

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,420
primarily focused on data exfiltration

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,700
and the loss of patient records.

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,760
Not that that issue is
subsided, but it's been eclipsed

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,330
by a far more impactful
threat, ransomware,

41
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,780
that is focused on locking
up electronic medical records

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,604
literally the lifeblood of how
a healthcare system operates.

43
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:48,679
Now, ransomware interestingly enough,

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,640
has its roots in healthcare.

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,710
So an interesting historical fact

46
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,800
the first ransomware attack
called the AIDS trojan

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,619
was created by biologist, Joseph Popp

48
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,120
who handed out 20,000
infected disks to attendees

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,220
of the World Health
Organization's AIDS Conference.

50
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,010
Now, when your files were locked up

51
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,990
you had to send a ransom
payment via the mail

52
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,733
to P.O Box in Panama, needless to say

53
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,100
this was not the most effective
method of ransomware payment

54
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,123
but it was the start of
this entire industry.

55
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,442
So healthcare data breaches
increased by 2,733%

56
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,170
over the last decade.

57
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,440
And healthcare has been
targeted, but this only got worse

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,000
during the pandemic.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,090
But I want you to start
by putting yourself

60
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,920
in the shoes of the adversary.

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,070
So let's face it.

62
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,790
2020 was a hell of a year
for just about everyone

63
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,850
but what impact did COVID-19
have on the narrative wells?

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,299
Remember, there's a person
on the other side of this

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,300
and cyber crime is estimated
to be a $1.5 trillion industry.

66
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,269
So let's just put this in perspective.

67
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,160
The GDP of let's say
Ireland is only 328 billion.

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,570
So has this cyber crime
industry shut down?

69
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,390
Has it been impacted?

70
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,540
Oh yes, it has.

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,250
Remember that travel,
entertainment, retail, and education

72
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,060
were all major targets
for adversarial activity.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,670
Well nation state and organized crime

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,730
but they were all shut down.

75
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,480
It's not like a closed,
retailer's gonna pay a ransom

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,310
if their systems get locked up.

77
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,440
So the bad guys had to
change their targets

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,910
and well healthcare was an
industry that was still open.

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,900
So let's boil this down.

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,860
If you went to the doctor's office in 2019

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,520
in the United States,

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,520
you had get this a 12.5% chance

83
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,860
that your medical record
would be disclosed

84
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,430
or stolen in a single year.

85
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,530
And that's before the pandemic.

86
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,120
The hasty rollout of
telemedicine and the movement

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,120
of healthcare back office
to work from home in remote.

88
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,340
Imagine if I told you

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,290
that you had a 12.5% chance

90
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,970
of contracting immersive infection

91
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,313
if you went to the doctor, what'd you go?

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,050
So why is this happening?

93
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,360
Why target healthcare

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,053
versus let's say a bank
or an energy company?

95
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,779
Well, I think most of
us are probably familiar

96
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,429
with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,760
And I recognize that it was
never intended to be a scorecard

98
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,099
but follow along with me for a minute.

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,700
If we assume a maturity level of a three

100
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,690
on a one to five scale
is minimally acceptable,

101
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,390
which I think most of you that
are security professionals

102
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,390
would agree with been 66% of
America's healthcare providers

103
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,490
cannot get to that level, 66%.

104
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,530
And that is not a new problem.

105
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,049
This has been an ongoing
problem for years.

106
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,100
Now, this is not to say
that healthcare providers

107
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,620
are not investing in
security quite the opposite.

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,050
They're just not investing
fast enough to keep

109
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,600
up with the adversery.

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,890
And in many cases, including
the latest data from 2019

111
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,430
there are actually starting
to fall slightly behind.

112
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,550
So healthcare is open.

113
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,630
Healthcare is vulnerable and
healthcare is heavily insured

114
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,133
with cyber insurance and
likely to pay a ransom.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,200
So now, let's look at some of
the more key breaches of 2020

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,729
that impacted healthcare

117
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,830
and what we learned from them.

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,120
So to kind of set the stage here

119
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,130
at the start of the pandemic
reported some bleeping computer

120
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,909
reached out to multiple ransomware gangs

121
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,410
and started to asking them if
they would attack healthcare

122
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,720
during a time when I see
use we're overloaded.

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,540
Now here's some of the replies.

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm not gonna read them
all, but you get the idea.

125
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,830
No, we're not gonna attack
healthcare during a pandemic.

126
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,330
Well, of course we can take these folks

127
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,190
for their word, right?

128
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,230
Unfortunately I think some CSOs

129
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,760
might have actually believed them.

130
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,690
So let's take a look at
some of the big breaches

131
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,540
over the last year and a half

132
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,510
and how they started to
shape our view of ransomware.

133
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,349
We start with vcpi in November of 2019.

134
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,000
Now they run the it
systems for 100 clients

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,760
that service 2,400 nursing
homes in 45 states.

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,150
When hit with ransomware,
they decided to decline

137
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,169
to pay the ransom reported
to be $14 million.

138
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,140
It took down their EMR,
Electronic Medical Records,

139
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,650
email and phone service.

140
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,780
So this was a cloud
provider that had frankly

141
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,900
a large blast radius, including hundreds

142
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,179
of nursing homes all at once.

143
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,790
When they refuse to pay the bad guys

144
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,800
the bad guys started
releasing sensitive data.

145
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,300
This is the first of what we're now know

146
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
is double extortion.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,940
In other words, pay up or
we're gonna release your data.

148
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,130
Then we moved to UHS.

149
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,950
Now, UHS occurred in September of 2020.

150
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,310
And up to this incident,
attacks on healthcare

151
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,690
would generally limited to a hospital

152
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,780
or a clinic or an office at a time.

153
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,890
Not that these attacks do not historically

154
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,530
have a significant impact,

155
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,260
but again the blast radius
was well, relatively small.

156
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,560
Understand targeting is not
random with these groups.

157
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,280
They spend time picking targets.

158
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,190
So when UHS was taken down,
this impacted around 250

159
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,030
of their 400 locations in
the middle of a pandemic

160
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,159
taking out their entire it
system, including the phones.

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
The adversary was knowingly
attempting to take

162
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
down an entire system,

163
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
knowing that they would have
have a catastrophic impact

164
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,143
on patient care across the entire system.

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,220
Now, the good news is this
breach, it does not appear

166
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,470
they made it into the
electronic medical records

167
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,070
as they apparently were
outsourced to a cloud provider.

168
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,070
Now, in my opinion, this is the bridge

169
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,490
that crosses the Rubicon in
terms of adversarial intent.

170
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,830
Had they gotten into the
electronic medical records

171
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,550
it would have been far worse.

172
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,220
Even then the overall
breach cost is estimated

173
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,013
to be around $67 million.

174
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,220
Now we get to Dusseldorf
University Clinic.

175
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,430
So this is in Germany and
a patient allegedly dies

176
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,110
due to them emergency room diversion

177
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,200
to another facility 20 miles away

178
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,210
brought on by a ransomware incident.

179
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,570
Now, there's some reporting question

180
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,150
the accuracy of this attribution,

181
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,590
but regardless there's no doubt at that

182
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,690
at this point, ransomware
is impacting patient care

183
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,023
when it comes to a ransomware incident.

184
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,123
And then we get to the

185
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,159
University of Vermont
health network in 2020.

186
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,340
Now, we've got to say at the stage here.

187
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,590
In October 29th, SISA, the FBI,

188
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,110
the department of health
and human services

189
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,179
were warning of a significant attack

190
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,349
on the healthcare sector
with more than 400 healthcare

191
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,240
institutions in the crosshairs.

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,330
Now, by the time the dust settles,

193
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,720
there were about a
dozen hospitals impacted

194
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,300
the most significant of which was

195
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,469
the University of Vermont health system

196
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,170
where the adversary was successful

197
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,849
in taking down the electronic
medical record system.

198
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,590
It was so devastating
that the Vermont governor

199
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,950
deployed the national guard
to help with the remediation.

200
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,120
The overall anticipated
cost of just the situation

201
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,000
at Vermont, not even the other
hospitals was $64 million.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,070
They had to furlough 300 employees

203
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,983
because they had nothing to do.

204
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,670
5,000 computers, 1,500
servers were impacted.

205
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,510
The most significant impact was

206
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,260
to emergency, oncology, and imaging.

207
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,520
And this breach got everyone in healthcare

208
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,220
thinking about threat
intelligence and realizing that

209
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,420
well, frankly prevention is certainly

210
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,469
a whole lot less expensive than the cure.

211
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,280
So take a look at this map.

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,490
The New York Times produced
this fascinating study

213
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,430
looking at the density of population

214
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,500
and their distance to an emergency room.

215
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,300
Now, the darker areas on
this map indicated counties

216
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,109
with 30 to 50,000 residents that live more

217
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,070
than a 30-minute drive
to an emergency room.

218
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,340
Now this is in normal circumstances

219
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,650
and this is just the drive time.

220
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,189
It doesn't include, let's say the time

221
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,100
for an ambulance to get to you.

222
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,040
Imagine what this map might look like.

223
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,089
If a large regional system,
like for example, UHS

224
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,790
was taken down with ransomware

225
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,319
for an extended period of time.

226
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,970
Now to put this in perspective,
the goal pros for trauma

227
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,610
and emergency medicine
is to have a patient

228
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,580
to definitive care in under an hour

229
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,540
from the time the incident occurs.

230
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,939
This is referred to as the golden hour

231
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,440
in emergency medicine.

232
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,060
And it's not a lot of time

233
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,500
when you realize it includes the time

234
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,070
for the ambulance to respond,
to retrieve the patient

235
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,430
and package them and get
them to a trauma center.

236
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,040
Now, if you start taking down
an entire region of hospitals,

237
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,550
diverting patients you quickly realize

238
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,630
the impact could be devastating
at some parts of the country

239
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,840
that are already far from the hospital,

240
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,380
as you start to break that golden hour.

241
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,040
So now what I wanna do
is I actually wanna turn

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,500
the conversation to Robin and get a view

243
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,260
of what happens on the inside Robin

244
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,670
when all this goes down?

245
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,719
What's the impact of staff and patients

246
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,600
and well, the business
of running a hospital

247
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,070
when it's taken down by ransomware?

248
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,390
- What happens on the inside?

249
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,000
These next few slides are
based upon information

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,050
from two separate healthcare organizations

251
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,459
and what they went through.

252
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,080
Please keep in mind that no
two incidents are the same

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,210
and organization responses
will be different

254
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,420
for each breach.

255
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,610
Thankfully, this was
not at my organization.

256
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,740
However, we can all take this information

257
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,710
and the lessons learned from
them to help better plan

258
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,160
for an attack and how
to handle the response.

259
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,620
Now, let's dig a little deeper

260
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,670
into the timeline of these attacks

261
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,540
with the real impacts they experienced.

262
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,329
The attack containment lasted two weeks.

263
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,960
Immediately their electronic
medical record system

264
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,990
went down and claims processing stopped,

265
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,730
their expenses went up over
time outside the system

266
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,360
and elective procedures were diverted.

267
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,310
While the electronic
medical record was down

268
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,790
they had 14 days worth of paper order

269
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,959
charges and results paddling up.

270
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,200
That was enough to fill
an entire conference room.

271
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,140
During this time they were
also conducting investigations

272
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,790
to determine if any Electronic
Patient Health Information

273
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,469
also known as EPHI was involved.

274
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,840
And if there was a
reportable privacy breach.

275
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,570
Two plus weeks post attack

276
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,270
the electronic medical
records was back online

277
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,270
but other systems were still down.

278
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,480
Cash reserves were now depleted.

279
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,010
All those paper documents
began being entered

280
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,000
and scanned into the system.

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,220
Think about how much
paper it takes to fill

282
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,950
an entire conference room.

283
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,890
Now, I think about what that workload is

284
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,780
to get all that entered and scanned

285
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,120
into the system huge effort.

286
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
Nine plus weeks post attack,

287
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,440
the first claims were
finally getting paid.

288
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,210
Cash deficit reached $100,000 per bed.

289
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,140
26 weeks post attack.

290
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,100
So six months later all back
claims were submitted and paid

291
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,100
but there was a 6% to
10% reduction in revenue

292
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,630
due to the loss charge capture.

293
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,090
In the end, a 200-bed facility
in a competitive market

294
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,583
never fully recovered.

295
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,510
From org-wide perspective,
in addition to the downtime

296
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,530
they had to open and staff

297
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,079
an incident command center 24/7.

298
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,270
The paper processing was being
done for nearly everything

299
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,870
and younger staff weren't familiar

300
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,970
with the paper downtown procedures.

301
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,350
Thank goodness for seasoned nurses.

302
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,520
They needed many runners to go everywhere

303
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,829
pick up lab orders, et cetera.

304
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,780
Their downtime boxes were only designed

305
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,350
for two or three days.

306
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,480
They ran out of forms
and prescription pads

307
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,130
and had to use a print shop for things

308
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,500
they could get printed.

309
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Paper order sets were found to
be old and outdated versions.

310
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,250
When I first heard about
these, I shared them at

311
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,910
our daily IT huddle

312
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,160
as they are things you
might not think about.

313
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,020
IT does a great job
about keeping systems up

314
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,160
but we also need to help the organization

315
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,660
think about the impact
should these systems go down.

316
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,880
There was confusion and
inconsistency regarding back-loading

317
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,810
of data and charges.

318
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,599
From a clinical perspective,

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,040
without access to
hospitals computer systems,

320
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,849
doctors and nurses are communicating

321
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,360
by fax, in-person or phone.

322
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,550
If the fax and phone
lines are up and running.

323
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,550
Medical records shows that
patient treatment history

324
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,610
are inaccessible and the x-rays CAT scans

325
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,960
and other medical tests
can't be easily shared.

326
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,850
Should we don't see
dietary needs allergies

327
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,900
or medication is normally
basic information

328
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,150
to tend to be in-house patients.

329
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,990
These all pose potential
patient safety issues.

330
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,440
In the records some patient
registration information

331
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,300
are being recorded on paper.

332
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,250
And some patients have to be transferred

333
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,463
to other hospital.

334
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,050
System impact idea to focus on payroll

335
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,699
and materials management.

336
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,970
You have to pay your staff

337
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,200
and you have to order your supplies.

338
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,320
There's no picture archiving
and communication system

339
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,390
known as PACS availability,

340
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,040
access to radiology and 2 and
3D imaging was a challenge.

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,910
Operating room schedules
were reviewed for elective

342
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,593
or postponable procedure,

343
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,930
Downtime information from the
electronic medical records,

344
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,099
724 or business
continuation access systems

345
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,420
lost nearly all value
after only a couple days.

346
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,300
The electronic medical record
was never actually impacted

347
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,829
but the limited workstations access

348
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,170
made it virtually unusable.

349
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,160
They had to focus on a few workstations

350
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,610
in order to maintain an up-to-date census.

351
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,340
The sounds initially impacted

352
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,880
because they were on the same network,

353
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,390
then flooded once up and
running due to the other system

354
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,603
still being down.

355
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,510
From an it and information
security and privacy perspective

356
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,780
besides all the containment
and remediation efforts

357
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,709
there were also those investigations

358
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,160
that need to be conducted into determining

359
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,770
if any electronic health
record was involved.

360
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,650
And if there is a
reportable privacy breach

361
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,833
in addition to the security breach.

362
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,810
The typical impact,
staff burnout, mistakes,

363
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,939
stress, and irritability are already high

364
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,950
due to COVID and health
care operations in general

365
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,150
but now throwing a cyber
attack and the loss of access

366
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,800
to systems can push it
staff to the breaking point.

367
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,920
They had to force a few stay at home days

368
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,680
for some staff so they can
recharge and come back refreshed.

369
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,489
You think about most IT shops,

370
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,830
the IT people are working
24, 36 hours straight

371
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,580
when there's an incident like this.

372
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,960
They had stress and worry that
any negative patient outcome

373
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,213
would be their fault.

374
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,319
They were stressed and worried about

375
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,370
missing something critical.

376
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,620
It's the reverse the basis

377
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,490
of critical cancer regiment data access

378
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,500
to old clinical data images,
access to allergy data.

379
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,730
The remediation services
was not what was expected.

380
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,880
They required obtaining extra staff

381
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,603
from peer organizations and temp agencies.

382
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,419
The recovery had many
delays as previously noted

383
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,310
and then additional
expenses of 250 to 500,000

384
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,888
not including new security
hardware or software.

385
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:18,089
And there was the lost revenue.

386
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,589
With no incoming cashflow

387
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,689
while having all the additional expenses

388
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,203
they had a revenue
reduction of $2 million.

389
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,700
There was no progress on any
IT projects for several months.

390
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,630
And the cleanup is never 100% done.

391
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,500
Even after a solid four months
of enterprise wide effort,

392
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,770
it was still happening
six months post to that.

393
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,116
There was confusion and
inconsistency of cleanup processes.

394
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:47,379
There was no clear roles and
responsibilities outlined.

395
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,217
Some departments in clinics
entered their own back load

396
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:53,290
of data, other side of
ancillary departments

397
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,280
or enter their orders and charges.

398
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,020
A few didn't nothing or
any frustration and delays.

399
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,139
There was finger pointing
and comments such as

400
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,123
it's not my job or burn out responses.

401
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,897
There was missing data.

402
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,540
They're are still
occasionally finding missing

403
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,673
charge order or results.

404
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,300
The adverse impact lasts a long time.

405
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,149
The financial recovery
following a ransomware event

406
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,620
takes a minimum six months
and in some cases years

407
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,989
and even then the end recover what costs

408
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,513
are measured in the millions.

409
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,240
There's potential regulatory
fines and civil lawsuits.

410
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Financial penalties can be sanctioned

411
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,240
by the office of civil
rights known as OCR.

412
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,410
The attorney generals can also
sanction financial penalties

413
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,050
if a breach of electronic
patient health information

414
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,090
breaches state legislation.

415
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,730
And if it can be shown that an
individual has sustained harm

416
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,520
as a result of negligence
of the covered entity

417
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,250
or business associates,
it is also possible

418
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,600
for the individual to initiate

419
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,040
a civil lawsuit for compensation.

420
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,360
These can range anywhere
between 100 up to in excess

421
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,350
of 1.5 million for breach.

422
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,709
If losses can be filed
against organizations

423
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,060
even when the breach occurred

424
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,409
to one of your third party associates.

425
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,170
So even if the breach isn't yours

426
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,573
if it's your data, your
organization's responsible.

427
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,050
When we get into loss of patients' trust,

428
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,550
that leads the patients to
change where they receive care

429
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,440
and organizations that pay the ransom

430
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,093
may face additional fine.

431
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,730
US organizations that
paid ransom were targeted

432
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,730
and attacked again with
ransomware 73% of the time.

433
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,360
45% of US companies with
ransom attack last year

434
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,620
and paid at least one ransom

435
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,933
but only 26% of these companies
have their files unmocked.

436
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,060
Organizations that pay ransom may also be

437
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,280
at risk by fines by the US department

438
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,533
of Treasury's office of foreign control.

439
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,120
- Thanks Robin.

440
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,610
That's really a fascinating perspective.

441
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,189
I mean, I just have this
visual of this conference room

442
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,470
full of paper as nurses
and doctors have to switch

443
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,330
to more manual means during an incident.

444
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,139
Well, let's now pivot again
and let's look at what's

445
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,550
on the horizon and what
adversaries are targeting next.

446
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,200
And let's start this conversation

447
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,320
by talking about vaccine
producers in the cold chain.

448
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,530
Now the bad news here

449
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,250
is there a lot of signs
of significant targeting.

450
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,890
The good news, at least
as of this recording

451
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,700
is that we're seeing targeting
and breach disclosures

452
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,180
but not a whole lot of
reports of material breaches.

453
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,660
Now, every transfer during

454
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,150
the vaccine production
distribution process

455
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,640
represents a different
potential attack point

456
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,290
as you can see on this chart.

457
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,350
But just to give you an example

458
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,649
of a few things that have happened so far

459
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,810
IBM X-Force researchers
discovered in September of 2020,

460
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,520
a COVID-19 phishing campaign targeting

461
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,100
the cold supply chain by
impersonating a business executive

462
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,570
from a biomedical company.

463
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,080
A miracle, the largest cold
storage provider in the US

464
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,070
disclosed in November
that had been the victim

465
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,300
of a cyber attack.

466
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,820
Might know the German biotech supplier

467
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,240
of SARS COVID to antigens

468
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,300
impacted in a similar
timeframe as a miracle.

469
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,560
In February, Oxford
university reported a breach

470
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,250
in their structural biology lab

471
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,140
where researchers were
doing COVID-19 research.

472
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,740
Microsoft noted in November
the nation state actors

473
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,870
were identified as targeting
seven prominent companies

474
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,149
directly involved in researching
vaccines and treatments.

475
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,570
And in February, South Korea's
intelligence agency reports

476
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,070
that North Korea attempted to obtain

477
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,800
coronavirus-related technology
by attacking Pfizer.

478
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,260
So again, as of this
writing, lots of targeting

479
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,220
but no real significant impacts.

480
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,370
Now the next thing is
we're creating new data

481
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,409
during the pandemic.

482
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,910
And one of those data elements

483
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,450
we really haven't thought about
how to secure or regulate.

484
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,480
Now, we've been sharing location data

485
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,810
off of our phones and applications

486
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,810
and the games we play and
the mapping and GPS for years

487
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,600
but COVID-19 contact tracing data

488
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,889
contains this really
interesting new element

489
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,880
that we all haven't thought through.

490
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,120
Who you associate with.

491
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,929
Not just where you've
been, but who you're near.

492
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,670
So think about what's in
this dataset for a second,

493
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,430
family, friends, coworkers,
all right that's obvious.

494
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,020
Students and coast
students, frequent visits,

495
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,420
like, you know, the gym,
the hair salon, your office,

496
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,210
but what's also in this
are lovers, drug dealers,

497
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,640
business associates.

498
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,660
And there's very little consistency

499
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,840
in how this data is being stored.

500
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,459
If it's being regulated

501
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,160
and what happens to this data
when the pandemic is over?

502
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,370
So who we associate with is
this entirely new data element

503
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,669
we have not thought through
how to address yet as a society

504
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,330
and what the implications could be.

505
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,379
How it's stored, sold, or shared

506
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,873
in ways we have just not considered.

507
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,430
But it's not all about stealing data.

508
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,300
Sometimes the bad guys just purchase it.

509
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,270
FBI agent EDU has been warning for years

510
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,670
about the investment
Chinese entities are making

511
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,970
in the field of genomic sequencing.

512
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,380
Now China has gained significant access

513
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,880
to Western genomic data
and biological samples

514
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,660
through research
partnerships, investments,

515
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,590
mergers and acquisitions.

516
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,980
This literally includes US
healthcare accreditation's,

517
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,753
work with US hospitals
and even investment in 23.

518
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,120
The point here is if you're
gonna do genomic sequencing

519
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,290
there's a very good chance the equipment,

520
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,220
the laboratory, the foundational research

521
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,530
or the companies involved
have a Chinese nexus.

522
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,570
So a little bit of a case study,

523
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,960
BGI genomics, now this is the
Chinese genomic sequencing

524
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,370
powerhouse was offering
COVID-19 testing capabilities

525
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,750
on a global basis.

526
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,750
They sold or even gave away 35
million COVID-19 testing kits

527
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,149
that were distributed to 180 countries.

528
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,380
They then built 58 COVID
testing laboratories

529
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,290
in 18 countries.

530
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,720
But in addition to the
tests and laboratories

531
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,210
they were also requesting that researchers

532
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,740
send the data generated on its equipment

533
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,500
as well as the patient
samples back to them.

534
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,830
So they could be sequenced

535
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,919
and shared in China's government
funded national gene bank.

536
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,340
Now for storing this
data that BGI created.

537
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,980
It has a partnership with a company

538
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,890
that you may have heard of, Huawei.

539
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,090
So again, this is all
legitimate above-board work

540
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,350
but it does raise some
really interesting questions

541
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,780
including a warning and February, 2020

542
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,750
from the National Counter-Intelligence
and Security Center,

543
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,280
which resulted in multiple
high profile media reports

544
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,879
including coverage and
Reuters, 60 minutes, the Hill

545
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,993
and a bunch of others.

546
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,510
So onto a new threat, changing data.

547
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,120
Now, if an adversary modifies data,

548
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,260
let's say in an electronic medical record

549
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,770
it is particularly problematic.

550
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,379
There is no reliable
secondary transaction record

551
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,220
to validate the accuracy of
an electronic medical record.

552
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,640
There are no receipts,

553
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,390
there's no traditional transaction logs

554
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,770
or statements like with
a financial record.

555
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,810
And many patients cannot
self-advocate for the

556
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,050
accuracy of their medical record.

557
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,120
So imagine if an adversary
states they've changed

558
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,419
medications on five patients,

559
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,900
but you need to pay them a million dollars

560
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,400
to know which ones.

561
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,350
What are you gonna do in that situation?

562
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,550
So a data integrity attack
on even a single record

563
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,409
breaks trust in the entire system

564
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,500
causing an immediate
impact on patient care.

565
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,550
And there are signs that this
is already starting to happen.

566
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,000
Hackers stole data from the
European Medicine Agency

567
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
and later leaked it

568
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,020
including internal confidential
email correspondence

569
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,280
relating to the evaluation
process for the vaccines.

570
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,730
Now here's the interesting thing.

571
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,270
When this data was leaked,

572
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,450
it was noted that the data
appears to have been manipulated

573
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,980
in an attempt to undermine
public trust in the vaccine.

574
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,980
So what I wanna do now is the
RSA team wanted to make sure

575
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,060
we all have some to-do lists for you,

576
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,200
some homework out of each presentation

577
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,610
that you could apply when
you got back to the office.

578
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,689
So Robin and I came up with
this admittedly somewhat

579
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,300
cheesy metaphor to
articulate to executives

580
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,330
the key things you need to have in place

581
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,540
to prevent ransomware
in a healthcare setting.

582
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,310
Now, the reality is this could
be applied to any market,

583
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,370
but bear with me.

584
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,300
First of all, we need some testing.

585
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,040
So amid the pandemic
testing is critical to slow

586
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,260
the spread as ransomware
attacks increase in healthcare

587
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,690
a compromise assessment unearths

588
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,720
if an organization is currently infected,

589
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,240
prepared and resilient
to withstand a breach.

590
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,150
Screening is critical both in
public health and security.

591
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,170
Now how about some social distancing?

592
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,810
Now ransomware can find its way

593
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,720
into the most protected environments.

594
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,840
So defensive strategy is all about

595
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,919
preventing the spread, sound familiar?

596
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,230
Just like we see in social distancing

597
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,070
as a strategy to prevent
the spread of COVID-19,

598
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,540
Ww need social distancing on our networks.

599
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,590
So if a single department of
an organization gets infected

600
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,520
it's imperative to stop the spread

601
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,850
from infecting the entire organization.

602
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,030
Network segmentation
divides a computer network

603
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,990
into smaller parts,

604
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,930
which can limit the harm
caused by ransomware.

605
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,770
So the last thing you
want is a small outbreak

606
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,760
in one department taking
down your entire system.

607
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,280
And of course we need
some contact tracing.

608
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,129
In a ransomware attack the
equivalent of contact tracing

609
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,180
is endpoint detection and response or EDR.

610
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,040
EDR tools provide telemetry

611
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,370
from every end point in the organization

612
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,330
allowing those IT teams to
immediately identify risk

613
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,120
at the first sign of infection

614
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,830
while enabling an automatic
quarantine as the team response.

615
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,540
And of course, to continue
on our cheesy thread

616
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,983
we've got to have some asks, right?

617
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,059
PPE.

618
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,170
PPE goes beyond pandemics.

619
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,460
Digital maps are needed
to prevent networks

620
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,520
from being corrupted.

621
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,210
Now in security, this
metaphor is really equivalent

622
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,130
to multi-factor
authentication based on access

623
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,710
and adversary will deploy
tools to crack passwords

624
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,200
and elevate their credentials.

625
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,310
Multi-factor authentication
will slow that adversary

626
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,520
and potentially send them off

627
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,420
to the more vulnerable targets.

628
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,400
And of course, if we're talking PPE

629
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,930
we need some scrubs and gaps.

630
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,310
If medical professionals
wore their everyday clothes

631
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,460
into a sterile setting

632
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,450
their clothing would
introduce unwanted pathogens

633
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,100
implementing a privileged
access management tool

634
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,260
or conducting a Pam audit
as it's often called,

635
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,020
can help detect any loopholes

636
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,790
in privileged users and keep
out the unwanted adversary.

637
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,270
And just like we got to go to the doctor

638
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,410
we need to get a checkup.

639
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,060
And an annual checkup helps identify where

640
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,110
individuals might need
medical intervention

641
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,490
or maybe a change in diet or exercise.

642
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,410
In the same way we need to check
up of our security controls

643
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,480
with a security validation assessment.

644
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,597
Now, what this is gonna do

645
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,410
is we're gonna test your
production environment

646
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,290
against inoculated attacks
to verify the people

647
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,100
the processes and the technology
respond appropriately.

648
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,179
And then of course we
need a treatment plan.

649
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,450
Just like doctors, if you get infected,

650
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,730
we need to build a treatment plan

651
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,560
for patients with a complex
illness like ransomware.

652
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,669
Time is of the essence and digital health

653
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,520
of the organization hangs in the balance.

654
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,650
Having an updated
ransomware response playbook

655
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,650
can easily guide leaders to manage

656
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,170
respond and recover from that attack.

657
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,220
Simply put, if you've got
the ransomware playbook

658
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,900
the impact is probably
going to be a lot less.

659
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,340
So if you apply these seven
things to your security program,

660
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,720
you can dramatically improve
your risk posture relative

661
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,553
to ransomware.

662
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:54,130
And Hey, it's a much
more interesting way to

663
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,320
explain the necessary security investments

664
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,300
at your next board meeting.

665
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,180
Okay, so now let's move up
from the word ransomware threat

666
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,460
to looking at your
overall security posture.

667
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,710
Now the goalpost, I want
to see all of you get to

668
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,030
is something we like to
call security validation.

669
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,810
Actually verifying if
your security controls

670
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,310
are working properly in
your production environment.

671
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,659
So think of this as a four-step process.

672
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,850
First step, not new, get
a third-party assessment

673
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,120
and take this well beyond a
traditional risk assessment

674
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,679
or an interview where you
sit down with an assessor,

675
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,240
get a third party to
look at your controls,

676
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,330
actively pen test and environment,
scan for vulnerabilities

677
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,010
and conduct a compromise assessment

678
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,800
especially where you've had
all these people working

679
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,370
from home over the last number of months.

680
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,800
A compromise assessment is so important

681
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,800
as it helps you identify
any endpoint that you know

682
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,720
may have been compromised over
the last number of months.

683
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,530
Why people working from
home or using workstations

684
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,950
and tools that maybe you
weren't so familiar with.

685
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,290
Next advance your program

686
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,639
by remediating the issues
found in that assessment.

687
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,070
Now, if you're using a NIST assessment

688
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,450
you want everything above a
three and headed towards a four

689
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,930
on that one to five scale.

690
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,500
Now, although this sounds
simple, remember the statistic

691
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,170
at the beginning of the
presentation where 66%

692
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,860
of America's health care providers

693
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,830
could not get above a level three.

694
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,060
And let's face it, that's
really just the basics.

695
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,100
So then let's also not
forget the importance

696
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,050
of managing process in people.

697
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,379
Do you have runbooks?

698
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,620
Are they comprehensive?

699
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,889
When was the last time you updated them?

700
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,720
Simply the runbooks should
be updated at least annually.

701
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,106
You should be conducting
exercises four times a year,

702
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:39,600
twice announced, twice an unannounced

703
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,040
and at least one of them
should ideally be immersive.

704
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,860
And in all the business exercise

705
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,129
versus let's say just the tabletop.

706
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,510
Lastly, and this is one
of my biggest takeaways

707
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,050
for all of you is to
bring security validation

708
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,200
into your program.

709
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,090
Now, this technology has
really advanced significantly

710
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,550
and it works by effectively
launching northwars attack

711
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,889
in your production environment.

712
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,920
The tools then monitor your security logs

713
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,810
to validate if the security controls,

714
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,860
the people, the processes
were working properly.

715
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,610
So did the IPS detect the attack?

716
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,189
Did the EDR fire?

717
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,500
Did it properly correlate in the SIM?

718
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,820
Did your SOC open a ticket?

719
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,000
How long did it take?

720
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,890
Was it dispositioned and investigated

721
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,180
in a reasonable period of time?

722
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,270
So again, think of security
validation as your end goal

723
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,240
it can prove that the
investment you've made

724
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,210
in your security program are working

725
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,083
and the team you have deployed
is ready for anything.

726
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,340
So the last takeaway in all
of this is your supply chain

727
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,173
and let's face it.

728
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:42,110
We've all known supply
chain security is important

729
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,240
but it's largely been ignored
since the target breach,

730
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,450
which was well eons ago

731
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,510
but along comes the solar winds breach

732
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,580
the Microsoft exchange vulnerabilities

733
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,649
and the focus is now on
supply chain more than ever.

734
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,980
So how do we better ensure the security

735
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,110
of our supply chains?

736
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,070
Well, let me introduce you to CMMC.

737
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,860
Now this is a us government initiative

738
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,020
for securing the defense industrial base

739
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,200
specifically focused
on military procurement

740
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,570
in the controlled unclassified space.

741
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,560
Now the US government is
losing 600 billion a year

742
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,179
in intellectual property theft

743
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,600
through America's adversaries.

744
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,790
And CMC is the answer to this problem

745
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,909
and involves a third party assessment

746
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,420
for the security posture
of a government supplier

747
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,930
leveraging a this based framework.

748
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,590
Or there are a couple of
things about this though

749
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,290
that are very different from
a traditional assessment.

750
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,899
First of all, is the scale of it.

751
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,260
This involves 300,000 military contractors

752
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,040
and it will likely expand beyond that

753
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,330
to other parts of the government

754
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,899
probably starting with the
department of Homeland Security.

755
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,790
Let's face it folks.

756
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,070
If the US government figures this out

757
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,260
it is headed to the private sector.

758
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,030
But it also has teeth.

759
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,060
If you don't meet the minimum requirements

760
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,510
you are not gonna get awarded

761
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,230
a government contract hard-stop.

762
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,500
The assessors are
credentialed, a rigorous set

763
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,470
of ethical standards, quality
review, and security controls

764
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,920
over the assessors in the
companies they work for

765
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,520
to ensure the integrity
and quality of result.

766
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,379
And it is an impressive model.

767
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,330
And I think it's likely

768
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,449
with the rest of the
industry is gonna head.

769
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,299
So take a look, learn something new

770
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,460
and think about leveraging
some of the CMMC practices

771
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,020
in managing your own supply chain.

772
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,090
So look that gives you all
a few things to think about

773
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,650
to take away and some homework to do.

774
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,040
When you get back to your office.

775
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,020
Prepare for ransomware,

776
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,310
add validation to your security program

777
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,759
and start to get serious about
your security supply chain.

778
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,810
With that, Robin and I
would love to open it up

779
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,027
for some questions.
