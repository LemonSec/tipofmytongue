1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,630
- Welcome to the Transformation
of a Digital Leader.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm Scott Howitt.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,680
I'm the CIO at McAfee,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,520
but I've held various
roles in many organizations

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,267
where I was either the CTO or the

6
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:13,559
CISO.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,650
And so I've seen a different point of view

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,397
on going through digital transformation.

9
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:22,470
And so what I wanted
to share with you today

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,910
is some of the experiences I've seen

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,770
and some case studies of how
teams are actually going out

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,150
and embracing digital transformation.

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,570
And I think it's really
important as with most things

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,390
is you got to start with a little history

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,910
to understand where we came from

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,500
before we talk about where we're going.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,020
So, from a CIO point of view,

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,020
the term

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,230
CIO was first coined in a book

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,599
called "Information Resource Management:

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,280
Opportunities and
Strategies for the '80s".

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,393
And so when the book was released,

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,067
the CIO was a very new role.

24
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,490
And to give you some flavor
where it was back then,

25
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,360
the first IBM PC was released

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,790
that year.

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,890
And usually the CIO

28
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,537
was somebody who was doing
mainframe programming,

29
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,780
and the role was elevated up

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,620
from doing application programming.

31
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,520
And so there was very
little budget responsibility

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,149
for the CIO

33
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,860
and it really took this
role quite a few years

34
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,429
to elevate to the level
of other C-Suite officers.

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,530
And the real idea behind the role

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,770
was that technology would
deliver more for less

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,539
in organizations.

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,910
And we're still seeing organizations

39
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,042
struggle with that concept some.

40
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,450
There's always an appetite

41
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,430
to spend more money on technology,

42
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,800
but what's the business value

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
that we're really getting out of it?

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,180
Then I think too, it's
important to look at the role of

45
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,440
the chief information security officer too

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,140
because it gives you a good flavor

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,640
of how things were evolving.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,633
So the very first CISO was Steve Katz.

49
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,470
It's Katz who was at Citibank in 1994.

50
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,989
And the reason that
they created the role is

51
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,180
they had suffered a large breach

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,670
and the CTO at the time
decided that he needed somebody

53
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,950
in this infrastructure organization

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,350
to take on the role of CISO.

55
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,150
And again, back to

56
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,460
a lot of companies were
still in the mainframe days.

57
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,530
So usually the person they pulled from the

58
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,850
rack F are top secret department

59
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,970
in the organization who was
doing just mainframe security.

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,670
And the role was usually buried

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,049
within infrastructure somewhere

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,730
and the CISO was very
rarely a peer to the CIO.

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,880
And so the role is really evolved.

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,890
But a lot of times it
was a compliance function

65
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,339
and not really a business
enablement function,

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,390
which is where I think
organizations are really starting

67
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,100
to look at their technical
officers and saying,

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, that's why the
role is really in place.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,220
So let's look at the
state of the CIO today.

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,440
Many companies not only have a CIO,

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,700
but now they're starting to
hire a Digital Business Officer,

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,760
or a Chief Data Officer, or
a Chief Innovation Officer.

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,370
And I think that the reason
that you're seeing that

74
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,210
is the role's kind of eroding a little bit

75
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,110
where organizations are
looking at the CIO and saying,

76
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,160
Hey, I need somebody
who's not just responsible

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,020
for running the day-to-day operation,

78
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,330
but I need somebody who's
really gonna transform

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,299
the organization.

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,060
And so I think they're looking at the CIO

81
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,720
and saying, Hey, maybe
you're not nimble enough

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,670
or maybe you want too much control

83
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,109
over how the business is using technology

84
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,910
to transform themselves.

85
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,859
And I think too, there's
a higher expectation

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,960
on CIOs that they're expected,

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,010
just like all the other C-Suite officers,

88
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,560
to not only understand technology,

89
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,443
but to understand the business
that they're supporting.

90
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,860
And now I think we moved from an age where

91
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,770
with all the different SaaS applications

92
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,079
that we have out there,

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,490
Salesforce and Elastic and
Snowflake and all that,

94
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,350
integration is more important
than actually building items.

95
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,250
And so how do you tie
all the clouds together

96
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,027
and how do you protect them?

97
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,250
And so the role is really changing

98
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,580
and I think that's why you're seeing

99
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,240
some disruption in the suite.

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Also,

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,160
the CISO has changed a lot.

102
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,220
So I know in the last
organization I was at,

103
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,060
I reported directly to the CEO.

104
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,363
I did not report into the CIO.

105
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,250
And a lot of times the role is elevated

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,091
to the CIO level, or in some cases beyond.

107
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,470
And the other advantage that the CISO has

108
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,303
is

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,803
he or she has regular
meeting with the board,

110
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,260
but I think there's still
a struggle at how do we

111
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,630
verbalize

112
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,409
our business value

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,323
back into the organization?

114
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,190
And too, with all the breaches

115
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,023
that have gone on for such a long time,

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,380
the CISO had an almost unlimited budget

117
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,600
because

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,330
people didn't wanna suffer a breach.

119
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,520
But now that so many organizations

120
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,930
have suffered breaches and recovered,

121
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,870
now they're starting to see
budgets shrink a little bit

122
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,720
and they're having to verbalize

123
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,610
their business value to that.

124
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,920
And then even more
challenging in the role is

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,530
we're used to a walled
garden infrastructure

126
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,880
where everything was in our data center,

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,210
and that's going away.

128
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,700
And so a lot of the
tools that the CISO knew

129
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,830
how to use and protect his
organization are going away

130
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,370
and they're having to shift to
other more cloud-based tools

131
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,856
or zero-trust applications
or stuff like that.

132
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:05,210
And they already had challenged

133
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,239
that there was a shortage of people

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,810
who actually understood security.

135
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,920
And now they're having

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,060
to finding people that are also

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,670
container or cloud or application savvy,

138
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,190
which is very challenging.

139
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,340
And what's gonna happen

140
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,710
is they're actually gonna have

141
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,150
to raise some of those
people up themselves.

142
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,310
And so let's take a case study

143
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,000
of an organization that has gone

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,070
through some amazing transformation.

145
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,336
So I wanna talk about Tencent and WeChat.

146
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:39,410
So for those of you not familiar

147
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,920
with Tencent,

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,280
it's a large organization
based out of Asia.

149
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,599
And they've really started in...

150
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
They were just a chat function.

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,109
And so they had WeChat,
which was a competitor

152
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,890
to their former messaging
application, which was QQ chat.

153
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,490
And so QQ instant messaging
was available on the PC

154
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,770
and they really wanted to
shift over to the mobile phone

155
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,700
and they were willing

156
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,840
to start cannibalizing their own market

157
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,270
in order to obtain more
of the smartphone market

158
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,580
because they knew in China,

159
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,150
that's where everything was going to.

160
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,409
And so

161
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,100
quickly, in one year,

162
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,410
they had 100 million users.

163
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,320
And then by 2013, they had increased it to

164
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,909
300 million users

165
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,010
'cause people really liked
the WeChat functions.

166
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,560
And then it started
adding in other features

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,850
like voice and video messaging

168
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,690
and things like that,

169
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,000
and WhatsApp, which was the
other big player in that space

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,090
didn't start adding similar
features until about 2016.

171
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,969
And so

172
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,260
then

173
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,730
Tencent and WeChat came
forward and said, you know,

174
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,270
since we have so many people
that are using our platform,

175
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,700
why shouldn't we get
into the payment game?

176
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,349
And so what they did is,

177
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,270
those of you that are
familiar with lunar new year,

178
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,700
in Asia, it's when you give
out red envelopes to loved ones

179
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,640
and people on your staff and all that.

180
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,680
And they said, well, why don't we

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,340
create virtual red envelopes?

182
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,150
And so they launched
their payment platform

183
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,440
with these virtual red envelopes.

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,330
And this resulted in
16 million transaction

185
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,820
and 5 million new bank accounts
acquired for their platform.

186
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,210
So this little spark of an idea

187
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,810
totally transformed them into,

188
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,570
Hey, now we're gonna start doing payments.

189
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,030
And by the end of

190
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,929
2014,

191
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,589
the same year that they launched that,

192
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,500
AliPay owned 82% of the market,

193
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,400
while Tencent only own 10.5,

194
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,170
but because they really
started leaning into this

195
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,110
and adding other features and functions,

196
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,220
suddenly AliPay was only having, by 2019,

197
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,800
AliPay only had captured 53%

198
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,729
of the digital payment markets

199
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,730
and then it eroded and Tencent
now owns 39% of the market.

200
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,540
So it's a big change in
how they're approaching it,

201
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,099
but then they took it

202
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,090
one step even further.

203
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,280
And what they did is they said, Hey,

204
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,730
why don't we just make this

205
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,170
a Swiss army knife of applications?

206
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,479
So it's very different than
how we've thought about it

207
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
in the U.S., if you think
about something like Facebook.

208
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,530
Even the messaging service is split

209
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,550
from the core application,

210
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,859
but that's not how they
did it with WeChat.

211
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,400
They said, Hey, we just
wanna make it easier

212
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,189
and easier for people to use our platform.

213
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,370
So

214
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,760
your chat function is there.

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,630
You can do instant messaging.

216
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,750
You can do voice and video calls.

217
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,933
You can do all of that.

218
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,660
It also allows you to do
third-party services like

219
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,810
Uber,

220
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,890
or they have a ride-hailing
app just like Uber.

221
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,180
They do news subscriptions.

222
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,130
You can do online air and

223
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,530
in-train travel.

224
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,890
They have online shopping
and food delivery.

225
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,970
And so

226
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,220
that was part of the third-party
services that they offered,

227
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,820
but they also offered things like

228
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,340
you could book a doctor's appointment.

229
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,890
Not only could you book
the doctor's appointment,

230
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,189
you could go ahead and pay

231
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,410
for the doctor's
appointment with WeChat Pay,

232
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,000
and you could take it one step further.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,370
You could go ahead

234
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,840
and have the prescription
sent to your home

235
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,380
using WeChat.

236
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,270
And from a social thing,

237
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,400
people are using it
just like they're using

238
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,819
Facebook, but they're also
using it as a dating app.

239
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,320
And then from a wallet standpoint,

240
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
you can transfer money,
like you can with Venmo.

241
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,940
You can pay your credit
card bills off of it.

242
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,720
You can donate money,

243
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,910
like you can do
Kickstarter-type activities.

244
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,760
You can do wealth management.

245
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,650
So

246
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,972
they added it all into
the app and gave people

247
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:58,300
lots of different options to use.

248
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,439
And so I think about this all the time.

249
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,170
In the U.S., think about it
when we're in a restaurant

250
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,740
and especially in the age of COVID

251
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,150
where we've done contactless,

252
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,060
I pull up the menu on my phone

253
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,579
and I look at it.

254
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,300
Why is it that we're

255
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,810
taking it one step further and say,

256
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,010
well, I might as well order

257
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,870
since the menu's in front of me?

258
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,240
And so you're seeing a
big emergence of this

259
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,410
in Asia.

260
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,110
And what they've discovered is that, Hey,

261
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,450
if I'm using WeChat to do that,
I can have less wait staff

262
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,750
and I can have better profits

263
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,380
or I can roll that into a
better customer experience

264
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,750
or I can spend the money somewhere else.

265
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,960
And so it's actually

266
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,510
a huge transformation that they're seeing

267
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,040
the restaurant industry go through there.

268
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
And so I think you're seeing a lot

269
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,670
of innovation coming out of this platform.

270
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,420
The more people use it,

271
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,219
the more that they request

272
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,510
and the more that they add more blades

273
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,580
into the Swiss army knife of application,

274
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,480
which is, like I said,
it's just a transformation

275
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,300
that we haven't seen a lot of here.

276
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,303
And hopefully, we'll see more of this.

277
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,590
And so let's look at why a
lot of transformations fail.

278
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,960
And I think the reason
that transformations fail

279
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,470
is that you hear people
say, "well, (sniffles)

280
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,990
the business objective I have

281
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,337
is to move everything to the cloud,"

282
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:23,170
and that's not really a business
objective, it's an outcome.

283
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,329
And so I think Gartner describes it well,

284
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,200
(clears throat) that there's
a Pace model that they have

285
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,663
on what should IT organizations look like.

286
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,480
And so one of them is saying

287
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
you really have three different systems

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,450
that you should look at.

289
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,230
You have systems of record,

290
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,290
systems of differentiation
and systems of innovation.

291
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,319
So let's talk about each one.

292
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Systems of record is what I really call,

293
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,750
it's systems of commodity.

294
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,480
It used to be,

295
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,350
when I first started my career,

296
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,330
companies had like big HR implementations

297
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,720
and they were very proud
of all the customizations

298
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,260
that they did and all that.

299
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,470
And then something like Workday came along

300
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,927
and people are like,

301
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:10,048
"You know, I really don't get a lot of...

302
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:12,690
It doesn't make my stock price rise

303
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,880
because I have a highly
customized HR system.

304
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,670
I can just use Workday and
they're gonna innovate it

305
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,630
probably quicker than I ever did."

306
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,850
And so you see that with ERP
systems and all that, like

307
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,920
those are systems of commodity.

308
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,810
You should put them up,
you should set it up,

309
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,699
and you should forget it

310
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,100
or move it to SaaS as quickly as possible

311
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,260
'cause it really brings no
value back to the business.

312
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,700
What does is a systems of differentiation.

313
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,610
And so where you have ideas
that make your business

314
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,380
just a little bit different

315
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,220
and that's what really
brings in the dollars,

316
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,220
that's where you should
make more investments.

317
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,053
And then

318
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,770
it opens up to

319
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,790
systems of innovation

320
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,060
where if I'm spending less
money on my systems of commodity

321
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,099
and I'm concentrating on what's happened

322
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,300
with my systems of differentiation,

323
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,500
I can spend more time in
innovation and innovating.

324
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,710
So you see, that's exactly
what WeChat is doing was,

325
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,290
hey, they got their core services

326
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,849
and got them up and running.

327
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,360
And instead of just enhancing
their core services,

328
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,810
hey, once you're making money,

329
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,079
let me figure out new ways to make money.

330
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,950
And so I think that's
where you really need

331
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,690
to help your organization focus of,

332
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,050
what would set us apart from others?

333
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,500
And then

334
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,290
I think the other thing that
causes a lot of problems is

335
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,959
business objectives have
to drive the effort,

336
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,310
but again, back to there's some

337
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:40,680
unrealistic expectations
on movement to the cloud.

338
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,900
And so I think

339
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,709
this chart is actually a
really good example of, "hey,

340
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm gonna take everything out of on-prem

341
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,670
and I'm gonna go ahead
and move it to the cloud.

342
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,737
And look, I'm gonna squeeze
my cost 'cause I'm like

343
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:53,850
the workload's more elastic
and I'll do all those things."

344
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,840
And then what really happens is

345
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,070
the implementation time

346
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,150
is a little longer than people expect.

347
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,260
A lot of it is just overcoming
organizational momentum

348
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,370
where there's gonna be people

349
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,950
that don't wanna move away from the cloud

350
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,823
and you're gonna have to
help encourage them to move.

351
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,240
And so that's one of the things
that we're really seeing.

352
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,910
I think the other thing that we're seeing

353
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,100
is that

354
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,150
we're retaining some of our data center

355
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,819
because we couldn't move
those legacy things out.

356
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,020
So now cloud in my legacy data center

357
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,840
is actually more expensive
than what I had in that.

358
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,140
And so

359
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,790
that's really a problem.

360
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,610
And so what you're gonna
have to really think

361
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,320
about is it's not only a transformation

362
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,330
of your digital technology,

363
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,020
but it's actually a
transformation of your people.

364
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,670
And so what you're gonna have to do is

365
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,370
retrain and re-certify your staff

366
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,440
and you're gonna have
to teach them new skills

367
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,880
like cost management and
cyber liability engineering

368
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
and things like that.

369
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,520
And then too, you're
also gonna have to set

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,550
the right expectation
with your organization,

371
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,689
that things are gonna fail

372
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,700
and assume that things will go wrong

373
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,650
until you gain proficiency
as a cloud native,

374
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,689
which is hard for a lot of organizations

375
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,900
to get their brains around,

376
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,420
but it's a realistic conversation to have.

377
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,363
So,

378
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,439
I think one of the
things that you're seeing

379
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,460
from my own personal experience,

380
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,230
being in technology industry for 33 years

381
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,730
is that the one constant around technology

382
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,340
is change,

383
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,370
but there's times where
we see major disruption.

384
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,380
So, I can think of two things

385
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,507
in my past where I saw
it as major disruption.

386
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:47,507
And the first one was when we
went from mainframes to PCs,

387
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,140
and then we started massively
networking together.

388
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,113
That was a huge change
in how things worked.

389
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,390
We went away from a lot

390
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
of printouts and stuff like that, too.

391
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,300
We did a lot more emailing

392
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,510
and doing virtual messaging
and things like that.

393
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,740
Then we saw companies take
these massively networked

394
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,470
organizations and we hooked
them up to the internet.

395
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,839
And that was a huge transformation
because now it's set up

396
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,520
business-to-business
transactions electronically

397
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,359
and all that, which
before were hard to do.

398
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,310
And now I think what we're seeing is

399
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,879
another large transformation
where people are realizing

400
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,670
that technology's becoming
commoditized and democratized.

401
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,040
Anybody can do entry-level things.

402
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,450
So how do we make your
business more resilient?

403
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,810
And what we saw, especially during COVID,

404
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,790
was

405
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,399
not only did we need business continuity,

406
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,810
but we needed business resiliency.

407
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,700
Organizations that were
able to quickly transform

408
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,180
and shift on a dime

409
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,400
went ahead and survived

410
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,870
and those that couldn't,
some of them didn't.

411
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,647
And so, I love this quote by Kennedy,

412
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,810
"change is the law of life
and those that look only

413
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,070
to the past or the present are
certain to miss the future."

414
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,496
You got to look at the lessons of the past

415
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:10,510
and you gotta look at what
you're doing in the present

416
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,000
in order to make sure that
you're prepared for the future.

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,930
So

418
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,730
let's talk about what do we
think we can expect in 2021.

419
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,690
Technology investment is
growing in all these areas.

420
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,690
So what we saw with COVID is
like contactless technology

421
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,480
is really gonna reduce the need
for face-to-face interaction

422
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,800
and the estimate is that
we've accelerated that forward

423
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,080
by 5.3 years because of
what happened with COVID.

424
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,080
So, where before Americans
typically on average had a meal

425
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,420
delivered to their home
once or twice a month,

426
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,800
and now what we're seeing is
three to four times a week.

427
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,740
Totally changed their paradigm.

428
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,573
And even

429
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,670
when you're going to a physical location,

430
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,990
you're seeing more and more
contactless credit cards

431
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,380
and things like that happening.

432
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,670
So you can have

433
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,660
less face-to-face interactions.

434
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,190
Too we certainly seen companies switch

435
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,920
to virtual interactions.

436
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,330
This whole conference is virtual.

437
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,370
We didn't see the rapid
embracing of that before,

438
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,899
but now we're really seeing it.

439
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
And quite honestly, I
look at my organization

440
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,910
and I'm not sure why we would ever go back

441
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,850
into the office in force.

442
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,330
I think my people are more productive

443
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,270
working from home

444
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,050
and I think it's actually

445
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,830
a better work-life balance that you get.

446
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,919
Even though we're working more hours,

447
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,733
I can choose when I wanna work in.

448
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,070
And we talked about this before,

449
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,800
I think you're also gonna see a shift

450
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,010
from business continuity.

451
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,050
Yes, it's important that
business are able to recover

452
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,830
from some disaster is happening,

453
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,350
but it's just as important
to be able to shift

454
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,669
and be more agile.

455
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,070
So I think you'll see a
lot more focus on the term

456
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,562
business resiliency.

457
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,677
Work from home will far outlast COVID

458
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:01,709
and that means you're gonna
have to really start thinking

459
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,500
about things like
zero-trust architectures.

460
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,480
How do I put those in place?

461
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,240
How do I set up better security controls

462
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,620
to handle people working from home,

463
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,860
and handling

464
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,800
people who are working on a device

465
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,190
that you perhaps do not control?

466
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,900
And I think that's a big
paradigm shift in security

467
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,250
because we love controlling the device,

468
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,250
and then it just might not happen

469
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,103
with the way that we're working now.

470
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,840
I think you're gonna see
that your presentation layer

471
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,689
will be separated from
your backend systems

472
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,560
through Headless Techs.

473
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,629
So again, back to the, hey,
as long as there's an API

474
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,793
or a container there waiting for me,

475
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,760
who says

476
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,220
I have to demand that you
come through a certain UI?

477
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,050
And so I think you'll see
a lot of shifting on that.

478
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,700
And you're seeing it already that

479
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,150
I can talk to one of my Alexa devices

480
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,650
or in my Google Echo
or something like that

481
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,450
and actually have an interaction
to my banking account

482
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,030
just like I can on my phone,
just like I can on my PC.

483
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,899
So the different ways
that you're gonna be able

484
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,540
to access the technology become unlimited.

485
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,409
And just like we saw the
democratization of compute

486
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,140
through the cloud,

487
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,750
now you're gonna start
seeing it through AI and ML

488
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,870
because

489
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,870
now I can just buy GPUs when I need them

490
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,810
and I can turn them back over
when I'm done using them.

491
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,169
And so where before AI and ML

492
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,810
was very prohibitive for companies to use,

493
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,710
now, it won't be,

494
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,460
which means you're gonna need stronger

495
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,880
data strategy and governance,

496
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,760
which perhaps your organization

497
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,827
might not have in place today

498
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,980
and you need to really
start thinking about it.

499
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,420
And then

500
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,060
I think it really begs the question is,

501
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,100
so what is the future of tech leadership?

502
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Do we need a CISO?

503
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,773
Do we need a CIO, but
other roles will come up.

504
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,720
And so I would say
tomorrow's tech leadership

505
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,380
is really gonna have to embrace,

506
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,050
and it's not just Dev Ops,

507
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,887
it's really BizDevSecOps,

508
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,050
is developers or as tech people,

509
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,050
we have to be more intimately involved

510
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,210
with understanding how the business works

511
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,580
and making sure that as we
go through rapid iterations

512
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,340
with the business

513
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,860
we also bake security into that.

514
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,120
And so having that mindset

515
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,399
is really got to shift people along.

516
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,050
I can't

517
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,270
tell people enough,

518
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,129
like read books like "The Phoenix Project"

519
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,963
or things like that.

520
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:39,550
Really change the way
that you're thinking.

521
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,383
And

522
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,340
hey, the internet of everything is coming.

523
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,889
You may have to meet it head on.

524
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,060
And so

525
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,970
IoT will be prevalent everywhere.

526
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,450
I worked in the casino
organization for a long time.

527
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,880
We had monitors that were
monitoring food safety,

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,780
environmentals, all those things

529
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,300
and you have to figure
out how to secure them.

530
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,190
I think if we didn't learn anything

531
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,580
from the Mirai botnet a
couple years ago is like

532
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,070
IoT will become

533
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,200
problematic and exploitable

534
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,080
unless we figure out either
how to micro segment it

535
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,470
and away from the rest of the network,

536
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,170
or we figure out how to secure it.

537
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,490
And so,

538
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,460
my challenge to you would be, hey,

539
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,040
we're technologists.

540
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,600
We understand the tech really well.

541
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,480
If I understood the business better,

542
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,020
maybe I would be the leader

543
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,810
in leading the business
in tech transformation

544
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,429
instead of being the
one being pulled along.

545
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,920
And I think, a lot of tech leaders

546
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,543
really need to consider their role

547
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,582
into that and lean into it more.

548
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,629
And too what we've seen
with the solar wind attack,

549
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,120
and then we also saw it
in our own organization,

550
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,300
not an attack, but when COVID hit,

551
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,139
hey, our VPN was up and ready
to go and it worked great.

552
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,430
Oh, but

553
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,610
some of the third parties that I use

554
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,360
to help with customer support,
their VPNs didn't work

555
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,449
and they were overwhelmed.

556
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,950
And so my supply chain shut down.

557
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,520
And so what we had to do was we set up

558
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,210
VDI sessions through AWS app stream

559
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,020
and allowed people to access it that way.

560
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,550
So we're gonna have to
come up with new paradigms

561
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,300
of how to deal with our supply chains.

562
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,260
And then too, I think

563
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,500
there is a legal and moral
aspect to, hey, as we get

564
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,040
more into AI decision making,

565
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,360
what are the ethics around that?

566
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,100
For customer trust and loyalty,

567
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,209
how do we manage that so that
we're not taking advantage

568
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,490
of people or using their

569
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,240
information in means that
they didn't understand

570
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,850
or intend us to use?

571
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,360
And what's the real economic
impact of what we're doing?

572
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,820
So these are all things that we have

573
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,860
to be very, very smart about.

574
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,840
And so

575
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,820
I think one of

576
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,750
the really cool things

577
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,477
that you had from Alan Parc was saying,

578
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:03,800
"hey, the best way to predict
the future is to invent it."

579
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,360
I think that's really the right way

580
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,500
to look at what we're doing.

581
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,090
And there's also a, hey,
we can't solve problems

582
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,600
by using the same kind of thinking

583
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,949
we used when we created those problems.

584
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,623
And so I think both of
those are speaking to the,

585
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,419
you can wait for technology to come along

586
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,000
and actually come at you
and just react to it,

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,693
or you can be a driving
force in how it changes.

588
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,060
And too

589
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,149
I think we're seeing a lot of,

590
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,720
back to the unrealized cloud dream

591
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,370
or whatever people shifting to the cloud.

592
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,469
That's because they're
bringing their paradigms

593
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,970
of how stuff worked in the data center

594
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,647
to the cloud

595
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:47,620
and it doesn't make sense anymore.

596
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,120
So if you think about

597
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,770
true transformation,

598
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,040
let's just use an
information security example.

599
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,060
We have vulnerability management programs

600
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,040
in most of our organizations
'cause we have a lot of servers

601
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,860
that were stood up and
people got to patch them

602
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,830
and we haven't gotten really good

603
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,310
about how do we update our
OSs and all that all the time.

604
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,389
So in some organizations,

605
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,040
I've seen vulnerability management teams

606
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,610
as large as 10 or 12 people

607
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,860
that do nothing but
vulnerability management.

608
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,390
If you've set up your
cloud workloads properly,

609
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,410
the day patch Tuesday comes out,

610
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,670
you patch a new image,

611
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,950
you test it and you start
burning down your old servers

612
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,320
and bringing up your new ones.

613
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,200
You can have a vulnerability
management team of one

614
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,010
who's just working with the people

615
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,150
who create the golden images

616
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,149
and move forward with it.

617
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:39,050
And so

618
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,230
you got to rethink and
retrain your organization of,

619
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,810
hey, here's more efficient ways to do it

620
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,940
so we can spend

621
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,657
less time playing with the technology

622
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:52,169
and more time aligning the
technology to the business

623
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,120
where the rubber really meets the road.

624
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,110
So how do we

625
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,530
apply these concepts to your business?

626
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,889
The first one, I think

627
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,520
the key components of a
transformation is, number one,

628
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,830
you got to get yourself in order first.

629
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,830
If everything that you're doing
as a technology organization

630
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,350
isn't in order and isn't straight,

631
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,550
you're gonna have a hard
time convincing the rest

632
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,230
of the organization that
they need to go ahead

633
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,863
and come along in your transformation.

634
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:27,120
And two, I think

635
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,300
you have to be

636
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,120
ready to embrace new
technology for innovation.

637
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,610
So, again, back as somebody

638
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,550
who works in the security industry,

639
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,620
some of the things that I've
seen that are really cool is,

640
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,453
hey,

641
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,410
now we're starting to see security tools

642
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,750
work with APIs of
application monitoring tools

643
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,310
or APMs

644
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,840
and they're taking that data

645
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,919
and they're saying, hey, this
is how we should be looking

646
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,520
at security trajectory or whatever.

647
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,980
We really hadn't seen that before.

648
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,710
So it's a very cool new
paradigm, or things like,

649
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,610
why do we have web application firewalls

650
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,719
still

651
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,190
when there's technology
out there that will

652
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,260
scan your code and say, hey,
you got a flaw in your code.

653
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,580
And you know what?

654
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,810
I'm just gonna go ahead
and shim the JAR files

655
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,250
so somebody can't take advantage of that,

656
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,630
and then you can come back
later and fix the code.

657
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,130
Like that makes a heck of a lot more sense

658
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,400
than having another WAF in place,

659
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,140
which is just yet another thing

660
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,173
that can go wrong in an implementation.

661
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,210
And focus

662
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,947
less on technology strategy

663
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,320
and more on business strategy.

664
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,830
How is what you're doing
going to help out the business

665
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,840
not just the technology team?

666
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,409
And you have to be able to
clearly articulate that.

667
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,493
And this can be achieved by, like,

668
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,310
work like a venture capitalist.

669
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,350
If you were pitching this to a PE firm,

670
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,629
how would you do it?

671
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,010
That's how you're gonna have to pitch it

672
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,160
within your organization.

673
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,030
They've got to see business value there.

674
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,720
So again, back to

675
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,200
really highlight what you're doing on

676
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,500
your systems of innovation
and differentiation

677
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,357
because that's where likely
the most business value is.

678
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,750
And you have to show
them the balance sheet.

679
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,850
I think one of the things I
struggled with most in my career

680
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,139
was really understanding P&L and cashflow

681
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,690
and EBITDA and all those things,

682
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,547
but guess what?

683
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:30,490
As a technical leader, you have
to understand those concepts

684
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,580
because this is how what you
do is gonna affect the business

685
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,495
and this is how you're gonna wanna do it.

686
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:38,560
And the effort should be there

687
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,350
to address business priorities.

688
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,370
If your technology strategy isn't aligned

689
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,810
with the corporate business priorities,

690
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,350
then you're likely working
on the wrong things.

691
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,169
And I would also say focus
on speed and flexibility

692
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,410
because that's where everything

693
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,100
is working towards right now.

694
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,889
And so companies wanna
see speed and innovation

695
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,170
out of their technology teams.

696
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,680
So,

697
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
in conclusion,

698
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,629
what I would say is

699
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,960
no matter what technical role
you have in an organization,

700
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,470
if you're a leader,

701
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,510
you're gonna be leading
transformational change

702
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,120
over the next few years.

703
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
And the higher up in the
organization you get,

704
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,260
the more that that responsibility

705
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,230
is gonna lie on your shoulders.

706
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,780
And so what you're really gonna need to do

707
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,710
is focus on

708
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,130
how you can talk to the business more as a

709
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,730
peer at the chair

710
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,770
than the technology person
who's sitting over in the corner

711
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,203
and people raise questions
when they need technology.

712
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,890
I'd also like to say I'm gonna have

713
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,670
a birds of a feather session

714
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,930
later on.

715
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,580
And in that session we
can discuss in more detail

716
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,139
or you can ask questions around, hey,

717
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,360
how are you doing it in your organization?

718
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,860
Where are you seeing successes

719
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,310
and where are you seeing failures?

720
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,610
And what can we do to do that?

721
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,580
So thank you for your time today.

722
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,923
I really appreciate it.
