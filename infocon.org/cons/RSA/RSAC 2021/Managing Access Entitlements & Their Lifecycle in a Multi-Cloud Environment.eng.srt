1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,670
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,883
My name is Anmol Singh.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,713
- Hey everyone.

4
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,730
My name is Victoria and we both
are the Security Architects.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,350
And today we are going to talk about

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,240
the managing access entitlements

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,893
and their lifecycle in a
multi-cloud environment.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,830
- As organizations continue to explore

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,689
and onboard a multi-cloud strategy

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,540
poor management of access entitlements

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,540
and the lifecycle introduces
several new and unknown risks.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,919
During the cloud migrations,

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,680
are leading to a number of
security and compliance issues

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,580
that continue to accumulate over time.

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,890
In the session today,
we are gonna talk about

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,800
how you should be effectively
managing access entitlements

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,712
and their lifecycle in
a multi-cloud setup.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,419
So this is how our agenda
is going to look like

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,333
for the session.

20
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,419
We are going to talk about
some of the stats from industry

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,790
that are going to be validating,

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,769
the overall uptake of a
multi-cloud environment

23
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,310
for organizations.

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,100
We'll talk about some
of the key challenges

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,250
that most organizations
and security leaders

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,100
are facing when it comes to
managing access entitlements

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,550
in a multi-cloud environment.

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,880
Also, we'll talk about
how some of these hybrid

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,699
and multi-cloud environments
are have adopted

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,920
for managing access entitlements.

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,550
And what's the mode of
popular adoption patterns

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,550
that have emerged over a period of time.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,070
From there, we'll talk about

34
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,369
some of the best practices
and recommendations,

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,120
basically an approach
for managing entitlements

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,270
in a multi-cloud environment.

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,270
- And from there we will deep
dive into the technical part

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,729
like let's do the some demo

39
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,530
and see how we can manage the entitlements

40
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,230
from the practical perspective.

41
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,350
And after that, we will wrap the session

42
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,690
by the takeaways and the action plan

43
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,789
which you can take with
you after the hour session.

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,890
- Thank you, Victoria.

45
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,633
So let's straight away
dive into the numbers.

46
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,410
This is how we have witnessed
the multi-cloud sprawl,

47
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,670
growing in the industry.

48
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,700
If you look at some of the
surveys from the industry,

49
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,550
you'll see that on an average

50
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,643
about 80 to 85% of organizations

51
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:16,560
have an active multi-cloud
strategy as of today.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,190
And some about 50 to 55% of organizations

53
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,590
are actually executing
on a multi-cloud setup.

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,130
Even if you look at the two
surveys on the left hand side

55
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,130
they're from a single
source about an year apart

56
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,140
and they talk about an
increase of somewhere 3%

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,900
in the uptake of a multi-cloud strategy

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,573
for their enterprise cloud setup.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,070
What are the key challenges

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,380
in terms of managing the access
entitlements in the cloud?

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,890
What we see is, there is
a cloud adoption patterns.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,290
Both the pace and objectives,
are not consistent

63
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,010
with the critical access
management requirements

64
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,859
in the cloud,

65
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,070
and therefore they are
ignorant or I would say devoid

66
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,093
of cloud access governance
objectives on a broader scale.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Basically the entitlements
lifecycle management

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,890
is more frequently absent from
cloud migration strategies

69
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,649
leading to continued access authorization

70
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,793
and governance issues.

71
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,230
Moreover, a lack of visibility
of anti-lifecycle management

72
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,030
across the cloud workloads

73
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,440
in the early adoption processes

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,510
leads to some inconsistencies

75
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,903
in the management of access
entitlements at a later stage.

76
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,600
We also see some challenges around

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,799
common cloud misconfiguration

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,330
evolving from the disparate
cloud security models,

79
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,570
security features and skills,

80
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,000
as well as the quest of organizations

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,383
to implement a cross-cloud
least privileged model at scale.

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,130
There is also an emergence of
multitude of entitlement types

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,000
given the capabilities of different CSPs

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,380
or Cloud Service Providers,

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,680
of native access
entitlements capabilities.

86
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,080
As well as there are
significant differences

87
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,610
in the overall granularity
of cloud native entitlements

88
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,413
that the CSPs are supporting.

89
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,539
We also see some of the challenges

90
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,840
around enterprises having internal

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,330
or native entitlement
management capabilities.

92
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,849
For example, they might
be using tools like IGA,

93
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,780
Identity Governance Administration

94
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,429
or even EAMs Authorization
Management tools

95
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,440
that are mostly,

96
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,940
built around managing
course green entitlements

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,920
focused on certain applications.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,140
And therefore,

99
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,080
they fail to address the
overall entitlement management

100
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,532
requirements of a hybrid
cloud environment.

101
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,220
Plus they can be really
remodeled for the purpose.

102
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,490
And finally, we also see that
there is very poorly managed

103
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,880
or entirely absent cloud access governance

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,159
resulting from a poor planning
of managing extent elements

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,710
early in the process of
cloud migration strategies.

106
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,610
So how is the state of
entitlement management

107
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,963
in the cloud evolving?

108
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,880
Before we dive into that,

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,580
I'd like to quickly take you through

110
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,090
some of the common
definitions of the terminology

111
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,690
that we are going to frequently
use throughout the session.

112
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,010
Well, access entitlements are simply

113
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,263
the individual access
rights or permissions,

114
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:30,310
which determine access to an asset.

115
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,800
The roles which are more
commonly referred to as

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,523
a logical grouping of
these access entitlements.

117
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,060
Administrative entitlements,

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,400
are basically the assignment
of attributes and permissions

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,549
that enable your users
to perform given tasks.

120
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,820
And most of the time

121
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,590
these are the entitlements
which are given to a user

122
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,989
at the time of provisioning.

123
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,669
We've also got runtime entitlements,

124
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,360
which are based on specific contexts,

125
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
depending on activity of the user

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,010
what the user is trying to attempt

127
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,460
when to access an asset or a service.

128
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,270
And finally Cloud Service Providers

129
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,000
as we all are aware of
these are the companies

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,350
or organizations offering cloud-based,

131
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,980
asset, services, resources

132
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,623
for your organizations.

133
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,140
So most commonly,

134
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,690
when you try to build upon
a multi-cloud strategy

135
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,600
or even a cloud migration strategy,

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
you'd see that there are
different type of users

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,210
who are trying to use
your cloud infrastructure

138
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,419
and services.

139
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,213
And they would result
into specific cloud roles.

140
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,660
Those roles could be auditors,

141
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,070
testers, operators, developers,
cloud administrators

142
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,230
or even the resource owners.

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,100
At the same time, we have got
the Cloud Service Providers

144
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,710
offering you different
cloud service model.

145
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,650
For example, there's a management plane

146
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,359
which comprises of different

147
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,040
resource management entitlements.

148
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,800
There is also going to be
infrastructure security layer

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,860
which comprises of
infrastructure entitlements

150
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,218
as well as network
management entitlements.

151
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:06,180
There is a virtualization layer

152
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,000
which comprises of compute entitlements

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,220
that need to be provided to
some specific users as well.

154
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,080
And also application security
and database security layers

155
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,919
which have got a specific
application access

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,770
and information entitlements with it.

157
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,940
Now, for all of these cloud
roles, as you would see

158
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,540
there's a need for you to provide access

159
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,940
to these different layers within
the cloud service provider.

160
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,240
For example, the developers

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,240
may need access to database
and application security layers

162
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,960
while they might have a
need to have full access

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,099
on the virtualization components.

164
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,130
As well as the resource owners,

165
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,640
who may need to have restricted access

166
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,909
or read only access to
application security

167
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,830
versus the need full access

168
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,219
on your resource management plane

169
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,393
or resource management entitlements.

170
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,150
So how are you gonna provide

171
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,120
the access management entitlements

172
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,360
and managed over a lifecycle
of these entitlements

173
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,913
throughout in the cloud
adoption framework.

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,990
All these roles, for example, as you see

175
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,860
they would be fed into your
entitlement lifecycle journey.

176
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,030
And those could be at different stages

177
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,880
of creation and addition of the roles,

178
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,659
for example, applications registrations

179
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,450
or those could be identified

180
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,063
as enterprise roles or
even application roles.

181
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,929
Most organizations have
some sort of a tool

182
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,479
or a framework to manage these roles,

183
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,500
to create these roles,
to maintain these roles,

184
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,630
upgrade these roles and deploy them

185
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,123
whether it's on-prem or
in a hybrid environment.

186
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,910
And these tools basically
comprise of a policy engine

187
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,910
which is eventually looking
to connect with your CSPs

188
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,139
via different sort of mechanisms.

189
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,080
There are different mechanisms

190
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,160
that these different
Cloud Service Providers

191
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,900
are supporting as of today.

192
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,270
For example, some Cloud Service Providers

193
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,189
might provide you with the
provision of gateway based

194
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,540
application proxies, that sort
of use a native policy agent

195
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,360
on the cloud service provider end

196
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,960
for you to push these access
entitlements into the cloud

197
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,580
for the applications to consume.

198
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,890
Some CSPs may have a built-in
policy enforcement point

199
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,900
and you need to integrate
your policy engine.

200
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,560
We are some sort of a framework

201
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,779
that would push these automation claims

202
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,250
for these access
permissions to be enforced

203
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,900
in the cloud service provider

204
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,620
for the users to access these resources

205
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,963
or applications on demand.

206
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,670
There is also, some mechanisms

207
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,110
which we have depicted as
broken policy management

208
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,890
because they require manual intervention

209
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,430
for you to push these rules

210
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,780
and push these access entitlements

211
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,459
in form of some flat files

212
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,293
or other formats for the
applications in a particular CSPs.

213
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,710
We have also seen some patterns

214
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,860
where enterprises are using private cloud

215
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,660
and they have come up with
an idea of maintaining

216
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,000
an entitlement databases

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,740
which are integrated with their
on-prem entitlement manager,

218
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,950
and they fetch in

219
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,980
the required access
entitlement and information

220
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,980
for the applications and
resources to be provisioned with.

221
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,380
Now, these were some of the
common cloud adoption patterns

222
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,510
for managing access entitlements.

223
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,680
The same time in the section
we are going to focus on

224
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,396
how you should be looking
at managing the entitlements

225
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:44,463
in the cloud.

226
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,459
So to begin with, you need to understand

227
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,013
and start to build on a
common evaluation criteria.

228
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,390
We like to sort of divide that
into the more specific parts.

229
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,730
How are you gonna define

230
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,060
your cloud administrative entitlements?

231
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,699
And this is going to be more dependent

232
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,800
on what kind of role model

233
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,199
that is existing as of
today in your enterprise.

234
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,150
At the same time what is the maturity

235
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,240
of an access policy management

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,960
as well as what is the maturity

237
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,530
of your group management capabilities?

238
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,220
For example, do you need
to create specific groups

239
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,750
when it comes to start
managing access entitlements

240
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,100
in a particular resource or application

241
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,790
or can existing groups

242
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,860
can be tweaked with the specific
access group permissions

243
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,490
for managing these excellent
element for these applications.

244
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,330
Also, you need to look into
what is the requirement

245
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,640
and also support

246
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,100
which is available for managing

247
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,833
some segregation of duty
conflicts that might arise

248
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,449
when these specific access
permissions are to be assigned

249
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,800
or grouped within specific
roles for the users.

250
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,740
All of these can be
dependent on the requirements

251
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,270
or capabilities around user provisioning,

252
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,600
access cataloging, access
requests workflows,

253
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,290
access approvals,
segregation of duty checks,

254
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,390
what kind of automation that you have

255
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,730
or you're planning to
achieve over a period of time

256
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,550
for managing your cloud
administrative entitlements,

257
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,089
as well as what is the
role lifecycle management

258
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,543
function in your organization.

259
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,680
Similarly, we have also got
the cloud runtime entitlements.

260
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,650
These are the entitlements
that need to determine

261
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,600
the type of faxes,

262
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,120
which will be given to a
user based on the context

263
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,973
that the user is bringing
at the time of the activity.

264
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,040
And this will depend on
the overall granularity

265
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,329
of the resource and targets

266
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,180
because the user is trying to access.

267
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,569
For example, what is
the kind of database VM

268
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,630
or a specific type of files

269
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,100
that the user might be trying to access.

270
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
There are the support
for subject attributes.

271
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,100
What is the user type, whether
it's employ a remote worker,

272
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,990
whether it's a guest user

273
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,330
or it's an consumer, what is the locale,

274
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,850
or what is the nationality of the user

275
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,140
and all those different attributes

276
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,330
which might be directly relatable

277
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,680
to this particular subject.

278
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,750
Support for resource attributes.

279
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,600
What is the type of resource
the user's trying to access.

280
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,349
Support for contextual
attributes, as I mentioned

281
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,380
those could be the geolocation
time of day, et cetera.

282
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,310
And finally,

283
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,270
the support for some of
the obligatory requirements

284
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,280
for the access.

285
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,650
Things like, if a privileged user

286
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,870
is trying to access a specific asset

287
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,830
which has privileged nature.

288
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,110
Again, you might want
to ramp up the overall

289
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,670
logging requirement for the user.

290
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,530
So basically the various attributes

291
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,610
that you are gonna be
evaluating for determining

292
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,417
these criteria are the class
of application or resources,

293
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,900
an oppression within application

294
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,900
that might also be required to
determine the type of access.

295
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,010
What is authenticated type,
geolocation time of day,

296
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,933
device identity, device health

297
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:10,293
as well as specific, you
know, a logging requirement.

298
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,270
This is what an entitlement lifecycle

299
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,410
in the cloud should look like.

300
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,410
So to start with these
are different phases

301
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,477
of how you're gonna
manage the entitlements

302
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:30,410
right from the stage of
discovering those entitlements.

303
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,449
So the first stage as we
talk about is the analysis

304
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,080
where we are looking to sort of discover

305
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,410
the overall permissions

306
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,719
that might be required to be built

307
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,290
as part of your overall
role design process.

308
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,150
Generally, role mining is a
very good framework or a vehicle

309
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,520
for you to start building
upon these roles.

310
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,210
Also, what is important
for you to understand

311
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,840
is what is the uniqueness level

312
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,570
of these permissions as when
you're trying to combine

313
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,100
or do a logical grouping of
these entitlements into a role.

314
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,440
What are the type of these permissions?

315
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,410
Whether the application system is specific

316
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,568
and also what is the scope of
these particular permissions

317
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:16,390
that you have discovered?

318
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,970
Similarly, what is the,

319
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,210
how are we gonna,

320
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,700
start to look into the
role designing process

321
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,170
where you would have
to start building upon

322
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,209
the logical grouping of these entitlements

323
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,080
by the business functions, risk

324
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,600
and the compliance requirements.

325
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
This is where you will need to
have the business involved in

326
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,000
and have an active
collaboration with business

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,960
to understand what is going to the most

328
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
logical grouping of these entitlements,

329
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,800
that is most relevant to
the business functions.

330
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,719
Also, you might want to understand

331
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,370
what are the different kinds of attributes

332
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,020
that should also be built
in your role design.

333
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,770
A common recommendation
at the stage is that

334
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,140
you might want to keep your role design

335
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,180
pretty flexible.

336
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,819
So you might want to also bring in

337
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
some of the dynamic attributes
or even contextual attributes

338
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,863
at the time of building these rules.

339
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,340
As well as you might also want to consider

340
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,470
what is a segregation of duty
risk analysis requirements.

341
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,640
At this stage you might want
to only want to consider

342
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,540
what specific permissions

343
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,569
might be creating
segregation of duty conflicts

344
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,140
when they're combined
together in a specific role

345
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,020
and how these roles should be assigned

346
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,593
to different users for
different applications.

347
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,150
Now, we move into the
role deployment phase,

348
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,319
which is more of a shared responsibility

349
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,370
between the customer and the CSPs.

350
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,670
This is exactly where
you start to think about

351
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,760
how you're gonna provision
these roles for your CSPs.

352
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,580
Off course, for the users to access

353
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,230
these applications and resources.

354
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,640
Most CSPs would offer you
some sort of a role simulation

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
capability and this could be
in form of a role simulators

356
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,230
or some sort of a, what
if analysis exercises

357
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,670
where you can understand what
is the going to be the impact

358
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,253
when these roles are
provisioned for the users.

359
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,359
At this stage, you also
might want to consider

360
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,639
what is going to be your
deployment methodology.

361
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,010
How are you gonna make
sure that these roles

362
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,030
are going to be deployed
across the different CSPs

363
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,270
as well as different environments

364
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,639
that are going to be
provisioned in the CSPs.

365
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
As I mentioned, it's important
for you to also bring in

366
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,220
the DevOps perspective here to make sure

367
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,490
that there is most efficient way

368
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,020
for you to move these role deployment

369
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,760
across your environments.

370
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,140
And finally, what kind of
mechanism are you going to use

371
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,610
in terms of the deployment scripts

372
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,439
whether those are publishing
scripts, Terraform scripts

373
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,253
or let's say, pattern scripts.

374
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,360
There's also, the maintenance
capabilities for your roles,

375
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,963
which are most commonly
offered by the CSPs.

376
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,641
And they provide you capabilities

377
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:04,400
with updating these
roles on a regular basis.

378
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,320
Also optimizing these roles,

379
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,300
making sure that the
roles are consolidated

380
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,550
if there is a need to be.

381
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,820
Some of the CSPs also have a pretty decent

382
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,639
continuous segregation of duty checks.

383
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,060
This is also an important feature

384
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,260
because when there are
specific role updates

385
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,570
or some changes to the rules,

386
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,810
you're not gonna go back
into the role design process

387
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,480
to make sure that

388
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,460
the changes which are
being done to the roles

389
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,620
are compliant to the
segregation of duty analysis

390
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,629
or is the collection of
duty of requirements.

391
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,120
So make sure that your CSPs
also offer some features

392
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,870
around the continuous
segregation of duty checks.

393
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,162
And finally also,

394
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,270
what is the automated
remediation mechanisms

395
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,470
that these CSPs are offering

396
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,250
when there is a specific
conflict or a permission issue

397
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,100
with some of the rules or some updates,

398
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,110
which have been done to
this access permissions

399
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,959
within the roles.

400
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,370
And finally, we talked
about the role governance

401
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,219
which provides you the capabilities

402
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,930
for role approval workflows,
role certifications

403
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,930
which are again very important

404
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,500
for you to make sure
that you have a mature

405
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,820
cloud access governance.

406
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,740
As well as role model
insights to understand

407
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,760
how is the role model
progressing in the organization,

408
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,760
what kind of roles are
creating a particular back

409
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,070
you know, bottlenecks, what
kind of roles are more effective

410
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,822
in the overall operational process?

411
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,669
It can also be very helpful

412
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,784
for you to start working on

413
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,950
a sort of a role redesign process

414
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,620
by bringing in some some
of the information around

415
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,110
the roles that need to be deprecated,

416
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,270
the roles which are not used or orphaned

417
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,868
for a period of time.

418
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,169
As well as they provide you

419
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,720
with some good information
around overall role analytics,

420
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,250
as well as auditing and
reporting capabilities

421
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,960
to bring in the required efficiency

422
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,513
into your overall role management
and operational process.

423
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,290
So this is how you might want to approach

424
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,290
the entire role design
analysis deployment maintenance

425
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,100
and governance processes.

426
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,260
So you might want to start

427
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,250
with the basic entitlements analysis

428
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,150
and that could probably take somewhere

429
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,240
between three to four months

430
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,050
where you are gonna be more
responsible for making sure that

431
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,930
you are able to discover

432
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,650
and mind most of your
cloud access permissions.

433
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,300
Have an understanding
of those permissions,

434
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,620
what kind of permissions those are,

435
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,459
and what resources applications
that they relate to.

436
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,340
As well as you might want
to also start mapping

437
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,480
these entitlements,

438
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,070
through the cloud evaluation
criteria that we discussed.

439
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,800
Whether they are part of your

440
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,310
cloud administrative entitlements

441
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,179
or whether they are part of
your cloud runtime entitlements.

442
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,970
And again, what are the capabilities

443
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,930
that the CSPs are gonna provide you

444
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,433
for both of these categories.

445
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,980
From there on you would like

446
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,730
to dive into the role designing process

447
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,050
from let's say a third month onwards

448
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,740
where you are gonna look
into how we gonna group

449
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,870
some of these roles into the
business relevant functions.

450
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,139
As well as,

451
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,110
you might also want to start
building on a role design

452
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,879
with the right mix of the
various contextual attributes,

453
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,610
dynamic rules as we discussed

454
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,020
along with the attributes and the roles

455
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,879
which are going to be
a part of your overall

456
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,293
role design process.

457
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,510
From there on we are gonna look into

458
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,490
from fifth month on we're gonna look into

459
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,770
the cloud entitlement support.

460
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,603
And this is exactly where you are gonna

461
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:38,010
collaborate more closely with the CSPs

462
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,210
to start building upon

463
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,960
or carrying out some of the
roles simulation exercises.

464
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,730
As to what is the impact
of these roles are gonna be

465
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,323
when these roles are
provisioned into infrastructure.

466
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,500
How the role management
workflows are going to play out,

467
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,680
as well as what is the kind of methodology

468
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,530
that you are gonna use

469
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,803
for your overall role deployment process.

470
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,940
From there on, I would
say a month eight onwards

471
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,610
you are gonna look into

472
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,822
the cross-cloud deployment method.

473
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,080
So start provisioning the rules

474
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,480
looking to how are you gonna spend out

475
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,070
segregation of duty across
the various cloud providers.

476
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,974
As well as determine

477
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:22,005
or decide on what kind
of deployment scripts

478
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:26,300
that you are going to use
for the different CSPs.

479
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,629
And finally, for cloud access governance,

480
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,460
the best ideas for you to
start with role certifications

481
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,590
at a minimum.

482
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,300
And you could probably
start from month 10 onwards

483
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,879
to start getting some of the
really critical insights into,

484
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,410
if the users who need access
have the right set of access

485
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,800
on the right set of resources.

486
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,149
And from there on, you
might want to build upon

487
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,430
the things like, overall
access governance capabilities

488
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,680
things like, role analytics

489
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,143
as well as reporting and
despoiling capabilities.

490
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,893
Well, with that,

491
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,100
I'll like to get into the
demo and over to you Victoria

492
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,370
for the demo on Azure Active
Directory Identity Governance.

493
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,229
- Yeah, thanks Anmol.

494
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,730
So like Anmol all at,

495
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,340
there are a lot of the different
Cloud Service Providers

496
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,129
who are pretty well providing
a lot of the different tools

497
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,420
in terms of the identity governance.

498
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,280
Let me focus on one of them.

499
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,889
And in each particular case,

500
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,770
I want to look on the Azure

501
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,780
and we have the identity provider

502
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,330
which is Azure Active Directory.

503
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,379
So I'm in the management portal

504
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,970
and I'm going to cover the
part which Anmol mentioned

505
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,380
like in terms of identity governance,

506
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,760
once you have set up all the flow

507
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,430
and all understanding like,

508
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,120
what type of accesses and
who needs to manage them

509
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,050
it's time to implement them
for the identity governance.

510
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,470
And in my particular example,

511
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,523
I will focus on the an
administrative entitlements.

512
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,570
So I do have my identity provider,

513
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,480
which comes in with the build option

514
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,890
of the identity governance

515
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,930
and which has a different
services which are going to cover

516
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,270
the entitlement management lifecycle.

517
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,660
On the left hand,

518
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,750
we can see that it all starts
with the access packages.

519
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,790
This is a place where we create

520
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,899
and manage the access packages

521
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,880
which contains the definition

522
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:28,260
for whom that access package is targeted

523
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,220
what type of access it provides

524
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,800
and what type of the lifecycle

525
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,120
like, it could be in the peppermint

526
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,193
or it could be time-wise.

527
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,130
And then as well,

528
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,930
like when you start to work
a lot of the access packages

529
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,630
you may end up having a plenty of them

530
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,260
and there's a sense to
make the structure of them.

531
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,129
So there are the catalogs

532
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,160
which you may think as
an logical Chromebooks

533
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,390
but as well, the catalogs
itself do allow you

534
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,340
to define what type of the resources

535
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,230
are allowed to be exposed
in this particular catalog.

536
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,440
So once you start to
create the access package

537
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,950
inside of this catalog,

538
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,060
you are limited with the
some specific sources

539
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,010
and as well you can
oversee the access packages

540
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,730
and who manages these access packages

541
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,410
who is a catalog owner.

542
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,640
Which is really useful

543
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,260
like in this case, I have
like the marketing catalog.

544
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,950
And that means that I can just give

545
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,970
the rights to the marketing department

546
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,070
and always oversee the
some of the resources

547
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,350
where they are responsible for

548
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,230
and they can create the catalog,

549
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,260
the access packages
according to various needs.

550
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,160
And as well in today's world
we don't live in the silo

551
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,960
we work a lot with the partners

552
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,250
and that means we invite
our partner identities

553
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,130
or the users to collaborate.

554
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,130
And you don't want to end up
having the identity governance

555
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,790
which is pretty open and any
organization could be invited.

556
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,340
So there is a way how to configure

557
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,590
and limit towards the
connected organizations.

558
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,879
Like in my particular
case, I do have the Gmail,

559
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,950
like, or the Google of the Microsoft.

560
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,660
And some of them is like,
either configured by myself

561
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,050
as an admin of the identity governance

562
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,909
or the system just tracks

563
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,270
and see there was invited
some of the users.

564
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,030
And so from that particular organization

565
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,990
maybe time to edit is in
the connected organizations.

566
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,290
And off course over the time,

567
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,667
when you have a plenty of the people

568
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,209
who are using your access packages

569
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,920
and are having the same assignments

570
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,410
you want maybe to catch up

571
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,980
and see what type of
the access are granted

572
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,180
to do that particular person.

573
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,610
And this is where it comes like,

574
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,919
Anmol mentioned the reporting part.

575
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,010
So you could always select

576
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,200
and see that the this
user is actively involved

577
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,953
in the different type of access packages.

578
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,420
And let's deep dive inside
of all the access packages.

579
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,270
So when we create or establish
the new access package

580
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,960
we should define the several fields like,

581
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,910
off course, what is
the access package for?

582
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,453
And let me take the example.

583
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,020
The marketing department is
doing the marketing campaign

584
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,950
for the next few months

585
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,190
and they need to collaborate

586
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,590
as well with the external partners.

587
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,720
So in this case, we want to
create the access package

588
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,600
which targets that
specific marketing campaign

589
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,659
we have the time limited.

590
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,860
So we define the name, description,

591
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,040
and as well, we place under
the marketing catalog.

592
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,120
And the VCs as a next step

593
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
what we do, we define
the resource roles like,

594
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,560
what type of the groups
that we should give

595
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,770
like for example,

596
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,860
I would like to give one,

597
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,860
the access to the marketing resources

598
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,803
to the marketing resources,
to the marketing.

599
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,430
And enroll all of people

600
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,610
who are coming to that campaign

601
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,610
and the enroll to the
marketing team as a members

602
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,330
and, or provide the same
specific application access

603
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,320
like for the marketing campaign,

604
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,560
we have the role like as
being the default access,

605
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,440
or it depends what type of the roles

606
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,610
that application gives to you.

607
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,959
Once we have set a
settled all them resources

608
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
we off course, need to define

609
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,500
what type of request we would
like to build up on like,

610
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,880
what type of the policies.

611
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,490
And these could be the different

612
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,210
of all the internal users,
like for the company users

613
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,150
you may have liked the
relaxed way of granting.

614
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,570
So the person just sees

615
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,280
that access package applies
for that access package

616
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,280
and gets inside and gets
all of these resources.

617
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,990
Off course, maybe if that
person is specifically

618
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,363
into the marketing,

619
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,380
in the marketing team.

620
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,750
So you can limit the scope
who actually can apply,

621
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,130
but other than that,

622
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,730
you don't want to have any
approval processes or something.

623
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,330
In case of the users who are coming

624
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,300
or the guests, your partners

625
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,629
may be you still want to
enforce the approval process

626
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,070
be it the business justification

627
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,070
and the specific approval person

628
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,129
who could be the manager of the project

629
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,253
or the some specific
person or more persons.

630
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,330
And once you have a
configured these policies

631
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,460
another thing is if you
are requiring the approvals

632
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,460
you may end up like saying
that for the auditing proposals

633
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,530
I would love to have
the additional question.

634
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,700
So you can define the additional questions

635
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,110
which will be asked to
these external people

636
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,500
who are going for their approval process.

637
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,677
And what is most important,

638
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,050
you need to focus as
well on the lifecycle.

639
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,760
So like in my case, I have
the marketing campaign

640
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,050
and it will work for
example, till the 6th of June

641
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,283
and may be as well,

642
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,180
you know, how it happens

643
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,440
when a lot of the projects
we tend maybe to go longer

644
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,003
when it was planned initially,

645
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,709
and you want to leave the space

646
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,590
to extend the access for the user

647
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,480
so we could request again,

648
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,200
and say like, yes, indeed we
need to extend our access.

649
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,720
So once you have defined
all of these things,

650
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,720
you end up having the access package

651
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,530
pre-created for you with all the details

652
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,973
and with the two policies
like I mentioned.

653
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,300
Let me switch here, to the two policies

654
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,040
which could be one different
policy for the internal

655
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,930
like we discussed without any approvals

656
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,300
and for the externals.

657
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,940
And once that access package

658
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,290
starts to be used by the people.

659
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,680
You will see that all active assignments

660
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:12,479
and as well like the logs
of all of the requests.

661
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,760
And you may find out that
there's some external person

662
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,010
who is pending for their approval.

663
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,430
So me as a responsible

664
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,170
for the maintaining these access package

665
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,880
I can just go to the,
myaccess.microsoft.com

666
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,910
where I see all the access
packages as an internal

667
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,320
to which I can apply,

668
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,139
like in this case we suppose
the marketing campaign, June,

669
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,740
but as well, since I'm the
responsible for the approval

670
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,123
I see under the approvals,

671
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,030
that someone is requesting
the access from the external.

672
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,540
And I can see as well,
all the details like,

673
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,220
what was a business justification

674
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,960
and what are the additional information

675
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
of what I have requested?

676
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,060
And if I find that this is satisfying me

677
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,490
I can reach out the rights

678
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,530
to the applications are the right ones,

679
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,330
I can have other reasoning
that, yeah, it seems good.

680
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,620
We need to give the access to that person

681
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,372
and approve the process.

682
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,460
And off course, then over the time

683
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,080
when you work a lot of,
all of these packages,

684
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,639
what comes into the view
is all the access of you.

685
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,030
So you want to see,

686
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,940
or since we have enforced
the access reviews

687
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,940
we want to see the results
and see how it works out.

688
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,620
Because we obviously want
to get rid of the people

689
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,570
who already have finished their project

690
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,700
and the shouldn't be active
in your identity provider

691
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,903
and shouldn't have the accesses.

692
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,840
The good thing is that,

693
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,060
in this case you cannot rely on the system

694
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,649
or on the identity governance

695
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,840
who does the sum for the analysis for you

696
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,840
and in the results if the
person have messed it up

697
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,920
the reviewing, the responsible person

698
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,200
was not reviewing when the
access review time came.

699
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,780
You always can see the
recommended action by the system,

700
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,470
and even the system says that

701
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,260
the user is not using that resource

702
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,050
it proposes maybe it's
time to remove the access

703
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,060
and in the settings

704
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,760
you can immediately put that
to be done automatically.

705
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,220
So it's a lot of the capabilities
from the technical side

706
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,720
but like Anmol described,

707
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,990
it is the most important part
is to define all that process

708
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,773
though the mining and define them.

709
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,389
The process of what type
of the access packages,

710
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,240
what type of the entitlement management

711
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,950
you would like to see
in your organization.

712
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,067
That was demo from my
side back to you Anmol.

713
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,490
- Right, thank you, Victoria.

714
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,230
And that was a great demonstration

715
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:55,230
of what kind of capabilities
you would need from a CSP

716
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,040
to sort of start working on
your overall role deployment

717
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,879
role maintenance

718
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,480
and towards a better access
governance capabilities.

719
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,640
And in this case,

720
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,219
it was focused on Azure

721
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,819
Active Directory Identity Governance.

722
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,560
So we'd like to talk
some of the key takeaways

723
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,820
and action plan from towards
the end of the session.

724
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,070
Some of the key takeaways

725
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,993
that you'd like to focus
on at this stage are,

726
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,540
you need to sort of bring
the entitlement management

727
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,630
and role authorization discussions

728
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,199
early in the CSP selection and planning,

729
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,600
so that there is sufficient visibility

730
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,808
into what kind of entitlements
you'd like to manage

731
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:44,840
for your users, for the
applications and resources

732
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,770
that they need to have access to

733
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,230
and how you're gonna define

734
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,989
and create the most effective roles

735
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:56,592
for authorizing or making
these authorization decisions.

736
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,380
You also need to understand

737
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,830
and define clearly DOCSIS
access requirements

738
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,569
for each of the IT and business functions

739
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,180
to come up with the entitlement matrix.

740
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,609
I think that's something
that we sort of showcased

741
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,093
earlier in the session.

742
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,720
Also, while you are working
on cloud entitlement journey

743
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,709
you might want to start
mapping DOCSIS entitlements

744
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,620
against each of the CSP's

745
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,281
native authorization
management capabilities

746
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:29,029
for the reason that
they might differ a lot

747
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,830
not only in the technical abilities,

748
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,560
but also as I mentioned in the terminology

749
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,690
that are being used
across the different CSPs.

750
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,020
Also, you should start working
on building a role model

751
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,670
and a deployment strategy

752
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,070
to achieve the maximum
amount of consistency

753
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,960
for your multi-cloud strategy.

754
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,190
The best consistency that you can achieve

755
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,800
would be more suitable for a consolidated

756
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,260
and a solid far more effective
account access governance

757
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,600
at a later stage.

758
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,060
And finally, if you have a need

759
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,299
you should also look into
evaluating, acquiring

760
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,180
and implementing the right

761
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,000
or appropriate technology or tool set

762
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,213
for your cross-cloud
entitlements management.

763
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,383
An action plan that you might
want to takeaway also is,

764
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,020
immediately after the session

765
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,663
you should look into reviewing
the access entitlements

766
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:28,990
and the concepts that we have
discussed in the session.

767
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,859
In the next coming two
to three months timeframe

768
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,020
you should look into reviewing

769
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,320
your business and operational requirements

770
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
for managing these entitlements,

771
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,130
evaluating the various CSPs,

772
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,400
identity and access
management capabilities

773
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,020
that will be required for supporting

774
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,520
your entitlement management
requirements or needs.

775
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,956
Work on defining an entitlement
lifecycle management process

776
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:54,620
to support your overall
multi-clouds strategy.

777
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,020
And also start to prepare a business case,

778
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,370
for cross-cloud entitlement management,

779
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,606
which is going to help you
gather the required sponsorship

780
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:06,570
or overall support from business owners

781
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,680
and application owners in the process.

782
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,029
Towards the last three to four months,

783
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,480
you know, when your timeframe,

784
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,940
you might also want to start

785
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,540
creating an access control model

786
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,589
that really suits

787
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,060
your overall cloud access
governance strategy.

788
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,799
So, as I said, you might
have a proper understanding

789
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,904
and visibility of your
access governance strategy

790
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:30,060
which assaults is overarching

791
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,993
your overall multi-cloud
or cross-cloud uptake.

792
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,839
You should also look
into building a framework

793
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,920
or sponsorship for selecting

794
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,100
and investing in an
appropriate tool technology

795
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,980
and processes that is going
to address your overall

796
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,740
multi-cloud entitlement
management requirements.

797
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,540
And finally start building
on and executing on the plan

798
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,310
that is going to continuously
refine, optimize,

799
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,570
extend your overall entitlement management

800
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,050
with the support of additional CSPs,

801
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,513
ID governance capabilities.

802
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,339
Well, with that, we like
to wrap up our session

803
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,880
and thank you for listening

804
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,880
- Thank you, and I hope you
have enjoyed our session.
