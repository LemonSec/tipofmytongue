1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,520
- Okay, our waiting room is empty

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,679
and you all are joining us.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,640
Thank you so much for being here

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,820
for our closing college day presentation.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,840
My name is Britta Glade,

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,219
I'm Senior Director of
Content and Curation

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,220
for RSA Conference,

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,570
and it's really been our pleasure

9
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,890
to have you here with
with us at RSA Conference,

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,730
we look forward to future events

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,490
where we'll be able to
get together in person.

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,409
Welcome to this job search session.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,830
And first off, let me
start by congratulating you

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,290
on choosing cybersecurity as a career area

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,500
of interest to you.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,010
You've chosen very well.

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,040
We're grateful to have you
here with us as students.

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,370
We really look forward
to engaging with you

19
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,300
today in this capacity and
in the future as colleagues

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,933
in this very exciting industry.

21
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,330
I am joined today by some amazing people

22
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,610
who will be leading
our conversation today,

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,160
and also as we move
forward with our session

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,623
in breakout rooms.

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,000
Our event will be as follows

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
and we hope for this to
be pretty collaborative.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,670
So feel free to use the chat panel

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,591
if you have questions that
you would like to be asking

29
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,789
of our speakers today,
we'll do our very best job

30
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,810
to address those in this conversation

31
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,210
or after the fact via social
media outreach and such.

32
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,789
We have Camille Stewart here with us,

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,780
we have Paula, Sarah,
Brent, Christine, Carrie,

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,500
and then myself who will
be hosting the session.

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,620
I want to not take any additional
time from our panelists

36
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,240
because we've got some great
prepared presentations.

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,240
And I would like to introduce
you to an amazing individual

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,070
Camille Stewart, who I'm
happy to call a friend

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,899
and a great ally and leader
in the cybersecurity industry.

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,370
A quick search on Camille,

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,560
and you'll find an amazing
resume among other things.

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,210
She's the Global Head of
Product Security Strategy

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,309
at Google.

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,650
She's also the Co-founder
of a very important campaign

45
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,190
called Share The Mic in Cyber.

46
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,679
I'd encourage you to look that up.

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,987
It's very inspiring the
work that she's doing

48
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,380
and encouraging across our industry.

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,350
She's also a cyber fellow at Harvard.

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,699
Camille, I'd like to turn
the time over to you.

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,799
- Having some technical difficulties.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Alright, thank you so much
for that introduction.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,780
And I'm so excited to
talk to you all today

54
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,500
about owning your personal narrative,

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,760
as you think about job search

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,829
and just as your career as a whole.

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,750
One thing that has proven
itself to be true is that

58
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,340
you should define yourself for yourself,

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,999
in the social media era,

60
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,990
in an era where people Google search you

61
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,287
to figure out who you
are, what you're about

62
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,480
and what you do,

63
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,619
owning that narrative,

64
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,240
taking part in curating
and crafting that narrative

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,790
is an important part of
your professional journey

66
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,060
and an iterative process

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,280
that will continue to
evolve over your career.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,580
And so it'll take some introspection,

69
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,460
it'll take a lot of self-awareness.

70
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,480
And one thing you will see

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,310
if you take a moment to look
at Share The Mic in Cyber

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,260
is that visibility and
platform can change a lot

73
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,190
for a practitioner.

74
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,803
So I want you all to be very intentional

75
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:07,350
about how you build your
professional narrative

76
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,191
and then how that leads into your resume

77
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,890
and into interviews that you conduct

78
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,036
and think about who you are

79
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,710
and what you bring at all stages.

80
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,810
And so I do that in, next slide,

81
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,450
I do that in three phases.

82
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,579
I think about it as do, validate, exude,

83
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,210
and there are a bunch of parts to do

84
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,720
'cause that's the introspective part

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,400
and it'll be really important.

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
And then we'll move on to talking about

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,130
how you validate that

88
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,690
and how you make sure that you are living

89
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,483
the things that you have
outlined, next slide.

90
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,680
So, how do you craft
your personal narrative?

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,270
This is where we're gonna start.

92
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,103
Next slide.

93
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,280
You're gonna think about this in parts.

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,940
It is a lot to comb through
everything that you've done,

95
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,507
who you are, the things
that are important to you.

96
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:54,430
And so I've broken it
down into a few exercises

97
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,340
that'll help you think
about where you wanna go,

98
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,520
who you are, what is important to you,

99
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,300
the skill sets you've already developed

100
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,570
and the ones you wanna develop.

101
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,590
So we're gonna start by
reflecting on the interests

102
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,280
and experiences you've had.

103
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,210
What do you wanna do?

104
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,870
Why do you wanna do it?

105
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,620
What's important to you?

106
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,410
And write down descriptions
of both of those things.

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,160
So both the internships you've had,

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,410
the jobs you've had,
experiences that are important,

109
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,640
and even take some time to
write down future opportunities

110
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,700
and what those look like
that you would like to have.

111
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,212
And then look through that for themes.

112
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,460
Some things that are really important

113
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,150
as you think about doing that

114
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,659
is don't reduce the valuable
experiences that you've had.

115
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,910
We often over simplify

116
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,440
things that sound commonplace or normal.

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,790
The fact that you are a
manager is not that simple.

118
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,780
The fact that you are a
receptionist is not that simple.

119
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,080
And experiences that
don't necessarily align

120
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,800
with your future goals don't mean

121
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,470
that you didn't develop skillsets

122
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,030
that are directly relevant.

123
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,039
Transferable skills are a real thing

124
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,540
and you should make sure
that you're conscious

125
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,090
of how you were using your time and talent

126
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,560
in the roles that you've had

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,350
to cultivate those transferable skills

128
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,700
and make those linkages for
folks as you talk to them

129
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,150
whether that's in an
interview or on your resume.

130
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,979
And as you think about the
experiences, flush them out,

131
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,210
really think about what you
were doing, to what end,

132
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,577
why those things were important,

133
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:30,250
and then to do some
work to prioritize them.

134
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,290
The benefit of doing that work

135
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,200
is you've done a lot of real deep thinking

136
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,400
about who you are and what you want,

137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
and you can pull from
that three to five words

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,620
that are essential to your
professional narrative,

139
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,010
whether that's the fact
that you're an advocate,

140
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,599
which is an important word for me,

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm also a lawyer and I'm
a security practitioner

142
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,163
as well as a privacy practitioner.

143
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,510
Those things tend to be central

144
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,900
to my professional narrative,

145
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,109
as well as the fact that I'm a strategist

146
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,980
and a problem solver.

147
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,210
So I pulled out some things for me

148
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,340
that were really important

149
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,739
not only in terms of
what I was interested in

150
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,850
but the demonstrated
skill sets that I had.

151
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,683
That's life.

152
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,729
I wanted to pull out an example of this,

153
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,600
don't reduce,

154
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,750
keep clicking this slide,

155
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,470
don't reduce the
experiences that you've had.

156
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,607
So someone said,

157
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,470
"I took a month off to
paint my mom's home."

158
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,190
That's not something I
can put on my resume.

159
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,023
Is that true?

160
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,100
Is that really true?

161
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,470
Next, keep going, yeah.

162
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,370
Think about what you really did.

163
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,292
You successfully let a
residential enhancement project

164
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,710
end to end, including the scope budget,

165
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,700
cross-functionally collaborated

166
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,120
with vendors and clients and stakeholders

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,340
to ensure that the deliberate
was met in a timely manner

168
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,830
and under budget.

169
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,109
That's a much different explanation

170
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,740
than I just took a month
off to paint my mom's house

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,420
and is not fabricating anything,

172
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,860
it is just a more detailed
description of what you did

173
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,760
in the terms that are
relevant for your audience.

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,245
So if you're interviewing for a job,

175
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,760
if you were thinking about your resume,

176
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,820
they wanna understand your
project management skills,

177
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,330
they wanna understand how
you work with stakeholders.

178
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,609
They wanna know if you've
had experience with a budget,

179
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,104
how you manage your time,
how you document things,

180
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:17,780
and much of that you
did in this experience

181
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,190
but you reduced it to just,
I painted my mom's house,

182
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,920
or manage the painting of my mom's house.

183
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,790
So I challenge you to really think about

184
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,160
how you're crafting the
narratives around your experiences

185
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,190
before you get to the writing

186
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,230
of your overarching professional narrative

187
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,150
or even writing your resume

188
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,929
or writing a cover letter
or anything like that.

189
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,763
Next slide.

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,139
So you've done the breaking it down,

191
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,230
you haven't devalued your experiences

192
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,620
or really thinking through what you did,

193
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,800
why you did it and the benefit
that was derived from it.

194
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,060
And you can use that

195
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,490
to start to craft an
overarching narrative.

196
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,700
The narrative should
highlight your strengths.

197
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,159
Not only the things you want to do

198
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,910
but the things you're just good at, right?

199
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,100
Problem solving is something
that I'm just good at.

200
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,700
So whether or not it's
my favorite thing to do,

201
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,962
I'm a good person to call in, in a pinch.

202
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,390
And then speak to your career goals.

203
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,750
Where do you wanna be?

204
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,010
Speak to the skills
that help you get there

205
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,099
and then run it by friends and colleagues.

206
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,210
If you've got people who
have seen you in action

207
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,299
whether that's in an
organization or at another job,

208
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,573
or at an internship,

209
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,960
either read off your description to them

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,460
and ask them if you've captured everything

211
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,650
or just have them describe you to you.

212
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,010
Sometimes hearing about
yourself from other people

213
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,600
who've observed you working
can be extremely valuable

214
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,950
'cause we're often really
humble about our own experiences

215
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,420
or we reduce them and oversimplify them.

216
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,520
This is an opportunity to see yourself

217
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,900
through someone's eyes.

218
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,390
And you often are surprised

219
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,449
by just how much people have picked up

220
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,360
about your skills and talents.

221
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,130
So let them poke your head
up a little bit, right?

222
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,163
Let them tell you where you're great.

223
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,492
Next slide.

224
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,727
Another piece of thinking

225
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,319
through this is about intentionality.

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,070
So you've crafted this
overarching narrative

227
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,055
that tells who you are,
or what you're about,

228
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:25,810
and then you can use that to
cultivate a elevator pitch.

229
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,160
So something that's really short

230
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,699
that just you can spit
out at a drop of a dime,

231
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,950
something that's a little bit
more tailored to a situation

232
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,100
like how you talk about
yourself in an interview.

233
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
So you're talking about it
in the context of the role

234
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,557
or how you talk about it
with a stakeholder or peer

235
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,180
and provide them context.

236
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,877
But if you have an understanding
as a whole of who you are

237
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,670
and what value you bring,

238
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,969
you can always tailor
that longer narrative

239
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,490
to the circumstances you find yourself in.

240
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,750
But a big part of that
is the intentionality

241
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,885
not only of how you talk about yourself

242
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,840
but how you align branding tools

243
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,267
and consider other factors.

244
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:07,080
So, if you are a professional

245
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,940
who thinks that a GitHub
would be really important

246
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,520
as you seek a job 'cause
you need a portfolio,

247
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,353
then engage that

248
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,370
but don't start a GitHub

249
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,360
if you don't have
anything to put on GitHub.

250
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,760
Is LinkedIn a mechanism
for you to find a job

251
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,700
or to connect with your
peers and colleagues

252
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,370
and folks that you've
met through networking?

253
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,770
Then do that.

254
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,650
Is Twitter a mechanism that is common

255
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,730
for practitioners in your space

256
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,720
to discuss information, share knowledge,

257
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
and find new outlets?

258
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,730
If so, then use Twitter.

259
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,310
But if Instagram is not, don't
use Instagram or vice versa.

260
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,839
Really be intentional about what you use

261
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,980
in alignment with your
professional narrative.

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,650
Now you can use those other
platforms in your personal life

263
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,209
and curate that accordingly
and lock that down accordingly.

264
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,154
But in terms of your public presence,

265
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:57,500
it should align to that
narrative that you've created.

266
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,170
And then like I said,

267
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,660
tailoring that overarching narrative

268
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,250
to your elevator pitch interviews,
networking opportunities,

269
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,800
and then think about how
you package it all up.

270
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,160
Does your look match what
you say you're about?

271
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,400
Are you...

272
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,380
If you're an advocate,

273
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,450
are you letting that
weave through your work

274
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,110
and how you present yourself

275
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,970
in your public facing
presentations and profile,

276
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,870
and does your record speak for itself?

277
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,642
Next slide.

278
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,210
So you've done all this great work.

279
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,130
You know who you are, what you're about,

280
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,180
where you wanna go, how
that all fits together,

281
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,569
you got the social media platforms

282
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,370
or websites that align with that now what?

283
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,530
You validate it.

284
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,290
You authenticate your narrative.

285
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,203
Next slide.

286
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,990
What you don't want is

287
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,940
for the thing that you
say is your narrative

288
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,380
to just not reflect the
person that you're describing.

289
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,860
You want to live the narrative,

290
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,550
the things that you were aiming for,

291
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,359
do things in alignment with it.

292
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
Make sure the things that you've captured

293
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,942
are things that you've actually done

294
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:07,330
and you can live up to
when called into question.

295
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,220
So don't talk about
things in your interviews

296
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,150
that you actually didn't do.

297
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,949
You wanna make sure that if you get hired

298
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,540
based on those skills,
that you're able to show up

299
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,810
and show out in the
ways that you described

300
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,800
in that interview.

301
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,520
So your narrative should be an authentic

302
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,449
representation of who you are,

303
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,990
and you should continue to live that out.

304
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,990
Next slide (sniffs).

305
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,110
An important part of that
is identifying validators.

306
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,770
Who are the people that
know that you're as great

307
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,100
as you talked about?

308
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,066
Who are the people in your industry

309
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,460
or even outside of your industry

310
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,940
who can speak to everything
that you said in your narrative,

311
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,140
and that can be pieces or the whole thing,

312
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,550
who can stand in rooms that you're not in

313
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,339
and talk about your
skillset and your abilities

314
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,080
and where you should go
and where you can go?

315
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,060
And how can you better
equip them to do this

316
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,180
by continue to articulate
what you're doing,

317
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,339
how you're growing,

318
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,540
where you're investing
your time and talent.

319
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,490
One thing that's really
important is figuring out

320
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,630
how the people in your life

321
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,840
can amplify the messages
that you're creating.

322
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,670
And so if there are people
who want to be mentors

323
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,860
and sponsors for you,

324
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,680
make sure that when they
ask you, how are you?

325
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,989
You're not saying fine.

326
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,390
You're telling them what you're doing.

327
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,530
That's actually a great tip

328
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,400
in your professional networking

329
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,870
and professional engagement
in general, right?

330
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,180
When people ask you how you're doing

331
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,780
rather than a high level,
I'm fine, or I'm doing well,

332
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,240
tell them what you've been up to.

333
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,400
What have you been working on?

334
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,480
How have you been expanding your skillset?

335
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,090
And that helps put more
validators out into the world

336
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,989
who can speak to the
things that you're doing.

337
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,890
So you've done it, you've validated it,

338
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,900
and then what?

339
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,773
Next slide.

340
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,540
You need to make sure
you continue to exude it.

341
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,540
So make sure your narrative
is clear in everything you do.

342
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,423
Next slide.

343
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,840
Seek opportunities to
enhance your narrative.

344
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Sometimes you even have to build them.

345
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,670
Much of my career

346
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,550
has been me correcting
a role at a company,

347
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,670
an attorney who does cybersecurity,

348
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,113
who's semi-technical,

349
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:17,320
it was not something
when I first started out

350
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,440
that folks were putting
down on a job description.

351
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,140
So sometimes you have to find the spaces

352
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,490
where you can thrive

353
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,870
and be able to explain to
people how you bridge that gap.

354
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,040
So create opportunities,

355
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,349
whether it's at your workplace
or an outside organizations,

356
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,930
and don't limit yourself
just to your nine to five.

357
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,400
An important part of creating a toolkit

358
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,319
and a brand and a narrative

359
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,010
that is all encompassing of who you are

360
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,010
is not limiting yourself to
the boundaries of your day job.

361
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,839
There are very few roles

362
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,004
where you could do all
the things that good at

363
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:53,140
or all the things you wanna do.

364
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,174
So do some of it at work,

365
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,619
do some of it through an organization,

366
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,130
and do some of it
through some other means.

367
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:04,130
So find all of those opportunities
to spread your wings,

368
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,199
exercise the skill sets you wanna use

369
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,830
and cultivate your narrative continuously.

370
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,663
Next slide.

371
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,600
You are not a stagnant person.

372
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,610
And so your narrative will
evolve just as you are.

373
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,570
So as your priorities
change, as your goal shifts,

374
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,820
as your place in life shifts

375
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,430
and you are thinking about
family or other things,

376
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,849
make sure that your
narrative evolve with it.

377
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,250
Live the narrative that

378
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,390
this is the living narrative
that should grow with you

379
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,850
and it should evolve just as you are,

380
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,610
and so be conscious of that.

381
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,040
If that means starting from
the beginning of the cycle

382
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,872
and really sitting down

383
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,230
and rethinking through
all of your experiences

384
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,760
and where you wanna go do that

385
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,410
particularly if you're
trying to make a big change,

386
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,170
it might be smaller than that, though.

387
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,500
It might be small pivots in your narrative

388
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,373
and small pivots in your behavior

389
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:57,010
and how you want to express the skillsets

390
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,120
you wanna continue to cultivate.

391
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,140
But you should continue
to be introspective

392
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,520
and think about what you wanna do,

393
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,420
when you wanna do it,
and how you wanna do it.

394
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,382
So next slide.

395
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,650
I say all of this to say,
define yourself for yourself.

396
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,650
It is really important for
you to be thinking about

397
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,750
who you are in this context continuously.

398
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,560
Because if you don't define yourself,

399
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,130
you are leaving it to other people

400
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,490
to figure out who you are

401
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,420
and what you are without your input

402
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,089
and that's not what you want.

403
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,930
So good luck

404
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,329
as you think about next
steps in your job search,

405
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,530
good luck as you engage
social media platforms

406
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,270
and write your resume

407
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,340
but be intentional about
how you pull together

408
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,310
your professional narrative.

409
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,959
You should be the master of that.

410
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,260
So thank you for your time.

411
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,180
- So much Camille.

412
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,120
Apologies for the mousing.

413
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
I am the human mouse here

414
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,390
and some things seem to be jumping

415
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,895
and some things seem to be not jumping.

416
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,620
So as you see, Camille
is the exact picture

417
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,480
of everything she just presented to you.

418
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,923
So thank you so, so, so, so much Camille.

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
In the next portion of our workshop

420
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,980
and I will encourage you all
to please, please, please

421
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,410
use the chat window,

422
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,119
send in any questions that
you have in this portion.

423
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,129
We are super honored to
have three amazing HR folks

424
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,680
here with us

425
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,390
to take us through really
the arc of the resume.

426
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,582
You know sometimes it's tricky

427
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,520
to know how to succinctly
develop that resume,

428
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,139
put in what skills you
have, what you've done,

429
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,150
Camille touched on a
little bit of the nuance

430
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,900
related to that,

431
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,340
and how do you best present yourself?

432
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,040
So here we have these three HR reps

433
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,090
who will talk you through
from the other side,

434
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,250
what they're seeing,
what stands out to them,

435
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,800
what tips to really help you shine

436
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
when you're putting together
an effective resume.

437
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,580
So Paula, Sarah, and Brent
are here with us today.

438
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,860
They'll also be staffing
the breakout rooms

439
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,129
at the tail end of this workshop as well.

440
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,640
So you'll be able to
have some, some face time

441
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,723
with them to ask questions directly.

442
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,130
So I'd like to start with Sarah Leroy

443
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,700
to start at the job description portion

444
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,620
and how to tailor the
experience right there.

445
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,409
Again, please use the chat window,

446
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,550
well Sarah will be leading
this portion of the session

447
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,040
with additional input
from Paula and Brent.

448
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,899
And we'll be weaving off of the questions

449
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,212
that you present to us there.

450
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,373
So Sarah.

451
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
- Wonderful, well Britta, thank you.

452
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,953
And I think

453
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,500
the very first thing to do

454
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,780
is to sort of build off
of what Camille said,

455
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,300
which is that

456
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,720
you own 50% of the employer
employee value proposition.

457
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,890
And so if you know who
you are and what you want,

458
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,890
then you can better match a
job description to your resume

459
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,653
which you've carefully crafted.

460
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,520
And one critical thing is

461
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,170
don't try to be what you're not either

462
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,810
and what you don't feel authentically

463
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,580
because that comes through.

464
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,470
So, when you're looking
at a job description

465
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,159
I think it's really important to

466
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,710
perse it down to...

467
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,960
I look at it like a game.

468
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
It's like, okay, what
are they looking for?

469
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
And how do I match who I am

470
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,889
with what they're looking for?

471
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,823
So,

472
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,247
you're passionate about technology

473
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:33,540
and creative problem solving.

474
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,530
Okay, you have a solid foundation

475
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,170
of software development knowledge.

476
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,890
You're pursuing a degree in
this, that and the other thing,

477
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,883
there are a couple elements
to a job description.

478
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,930
First of all they're not
always written this charmingly.

479
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,790
Sometimes they're really boring.

480
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,620
But what you have to
look at them and say is,

481
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,590
alright what is the overall...

482
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,470
Step back and look at

483
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,810
what is the overall company field?

484
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,048
What are the values?

485
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,330
What can I glean and ascertain

486
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,290
from the company by
looking at their website?

487
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,832
Then when you look at the job,

488
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:12,520
let's say it's a software engineer,

489
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,538
then when you look at the job description

490
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:17,350
you match that up to the
skills that you know you have.

491
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,159
I've learned this particular software,

492
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,580
okay, that means I can solve problems.

493
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,899
It means that I'm interested
in computer science.

494
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,760
Anything, again, bouncing
back to what Camille said,

495
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,793
anything that you do in your
free time, try and diagram it.

496
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,170
Many years ago, when I was
first learning how to write

497
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,801
they did something called
diagramming sentences.

498
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,270
That's what I do with a job description.

499
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,090
Diagram the job description,

500
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,129
print it out, put it on your tablet,

501
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,820
whatever it is you need to do,

502
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,810
and highlight the things that either spark

503
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,899
sort of inspiration and
energy in you personally

504
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,610
as you're sitting there and reading it,

505
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,820
and then tie that to your resume

506
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,602
or experiences that you've had.

507
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,580
I think the...

508
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,210
And I'm just gonna put one
sort of statement out there

509
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,110
for the women in the room

510
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,560
that surveys will tell you
that if there are 10 elements

511
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,820
of a job description

512
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,899
and a woman has nine of them,

513
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,760
she'll say I'm not qualified
'cause I don't have the 10th.

514
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,650
And for the men in the room

515
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,600
they might be only have one of them,

516
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,530
and they'll say, I can do this job.

517
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,510
So neither are bad

518
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,100
but you should know sort
of what our internal biases

519
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,439
put in front of us when
we're looking for jobs.

520
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,390
So I would also say, be very
self-aware in what you do have

521
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,320
and what your skill sets are,

522
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,790
but don't be afraid to go for it.

523
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,340
Because it's a first time
for everyone sometimes

524
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,233
for every job no matter how
high up the ladder you get.

525
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:58,603
So specifically tie what
the job description says

526
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,620
to the elements in your resume

527
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,129
or what you think you need in your resume

528
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:10,020
to create bullet points

529
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,440
and energy in your resume that match

530
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,290
so that when the
recruiter is looking at it

531
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,860
or a hiring manager is looking at it,

532
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,959
they don't have to interpret your resume.

533
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,900
You're taking specific language

534
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,200
and you're putting it in your resume.

535
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,860
So they go, oh, this person
has a solid foundation

536
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,209
of job development.

537
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,460
Recruiters don't say, hey,
they read the job description

538
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,600
and just copied into their resume,

539
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,580
and I suggest you don't
do that explicitly,

540
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,580
but you you should be curating
resumes for specific roles

541
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,449
not just have one standard resume

542
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,703
that you use for everything.

543
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,480
And Brent, Paula,

544
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,970
is there anything that
you would add to this

545
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,960
as we're talking about sort of
the job description element?

546
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,350
Paula looks like she might have something.

547
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,000
- Those are all great points.

548
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,770
I think it makes such a huge difference

549
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,900
to you're really studying.

550
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,130
You're studying that job description

551
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,290
and it's all about preparation.

552
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,480
So those are all great points.

553
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,500
You want to make sure
you're paying attention

554
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,430
to the details.

555
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,940
- Yeah, and the detail
actually is really important

556
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,020
because when I say
following Camille's advice

557
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,923
of curating your resume for each role,

558
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,530
you should also save all your old resumes

559
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,363
because you never...

560
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,380
First of all you always wanna
know what you've said before

561
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,780
because the internet is
forever, as we all know.

562
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,679
And the second thing is that

563
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,698
you're gonna have language
that works beautifully

564
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:50,170
in one resume,

565
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,350
and then you've shortened it

566
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,461
or changed it for something else,

567
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:55,650
and if you can't ever go back to

568
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,023
your sort of source code if you will,

569
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,800
you're losing an opportunity
to make your life easier.

570
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,270
The other thing I would say

571
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,750
when you're looking at a job description,

572
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,707
is really try to...

573
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,753
And this goes for interviewing

574
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,024
which is really not what I'm
supposed to be talking about

575
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:17,050
but you should always be in the mind of

576
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,040
what problem are they trying to solve

577
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,970
with this job description?

578
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,550
What is the role going
to do for the business?

579
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,629
Because it's not just
about you getting a job

580
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,040
it's about what can you do for them.

581
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,750
So it's really important in your resume

582
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,020
to make sure that you're tying,

583
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,410
that you're highlighting
what you can do for them,

584
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,510
that's going to solve the problem.

585
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,690
There's...

586
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,020
What's the job to be done?

587
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,149
If you can parse out
through the job description

588
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,790
what's the job to be done

589
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,730
and then tie that to sort of the character

590
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,550
and culture of the business,

591
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,820
and you can weave that into your resume,

592
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,060
you are 90% of the way there.

593
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,909
And then you just have to show
up as your authentic self.

594
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,567
So I'm just gonna check

595
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:07,330
and see if there are any
questions in the chat.

596
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,129
Looks like there are a couple there.

597
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:15,629
One thing that I also wanna
say about job descriptions,

598
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,880
don't get overly focused on

599
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,560
if you don't have something,

600
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,610
sort of coming back to
what I said earlier,

601
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,399
if you don't have something

602
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,290
then that's when you
wanna go through your list

603
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,540
of your volunteer activities.

604
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,070
That's when you wanna go
through that research paper

605
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,750
that you wrote, or that
project that you worked on,

606
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,990
so that you can say, I
have been an innovator,

607
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,180
I have collaborated, I have
done this, this and this,

608
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,430
and here's how, that may be
something you wanna highlight

609
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,600
in a cover letter,

610
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,389
'cause it might not come
through entirely in a resume,

611
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:50,790
but there's more than one way

612
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,200
to tie the job description to your resume,

613
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
to your cover letter, to
your LinkedIn profile.

614
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,550
So they should all weave together

615
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,923
and present sort of one holistic package.

616
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,780
So I'm gonna pass it to
either Paula or Brent

617
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,173
for the next slide,

618
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,550
or pause if there are any questions.

619
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,399
Brent, I'm gonna hand it back to you.

620
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,150
- Fantastic, thank you very much.

621
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,700
And again, feel free to
use chat for questions now

622
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,840
or capture them to take
into the rooms later.

623
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,838
Paula, you will be next

624
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:30,620
to take us through what does
that resume review look like?

625
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,860
- Okay, great.

626
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,513
Well, I am so excited to be here.

627
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,780
So resume.

628
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,053
What is a resume?

629
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,450
First and foremost it is
your professional footprint.

630
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,330
So you want to make sure that

631
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,740
as you present this,

632
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,410
that it is the best version.

633
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,410
So Sarah made a really good point of

634
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,960
you may wanna just pay attention

635
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,930
to what you've created before,

636
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,260
but think of your resume,

637
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,970
it definitely is your
professional footprint.

638
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,070
And what you're doing with your resume

639
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,429
you are trying to showcase

640
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,550
why you are a stellar candidate,

641
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,620
you're trying to promote yourself.

642
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,629
So, when doing a great resume

643
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,930
you're clear on what it is that you want.

644
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,650
And also, you're taking inventory

645
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,570
of all of your accomplishments.

646
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,310
So with that said,

647
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,290
with the resume that is here on the screen

648
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,710
as a hiring manager,

649
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,480
and any recruiter will tell you,

650
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,350
there really is not much information here

651
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,543
in this particular document.

652
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,223
When you're creating a good resume

653
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:50,899
there are certain things
that you want to make sure

654
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,800
that you are addressing.

655
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,233
So a few tips,

656
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,179
even though this does
look clean and organized,

657
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,810
it's very minimalistic

658
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,020
so there isn't much information there.

659
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,990
So you want to make sure
that the professional summary

660
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,260
and everyone has their pet peeve

661
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,700
or the way that they
like to look at resumes.

662
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,990
So I like to see an executive

663
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,930
or a professional summary up top,

664
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,460
you want to make sure that

665
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,930
that is not full of any type of fluff.

666
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,150
And also back to what Sarah said,

667
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,830
did you pay attention
to that job description?

668
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,830
Are you putting what it is
that you're after up there?

669
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,360
You want to make sure that you have

670
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,929
a section for your skills,

671
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,010
is that in a list something bullets,

672
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,860
something that's easy to scan.

673
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,780
So again, when you're
presenting this to a company,

674
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,620
to a hiring manager, a recruiter,

675
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,189
is it something that's easy to scan?

676
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,680
Can they clearly see your skills

677
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,769
or are things buried, jumbled,

678
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,810
do I have to go and search for things?

679
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,659
So, having that clean list is

680
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,987
always something really good to do.

681
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:20,800
Does your professional
experience include action words?

682
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,983
And again, as I scan this resume,

683
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,460
there are a lot of words there

684
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,230
under that network specialist.

685
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,410
I am losing interest by the second,

686
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,420
because you want to have
something that's clean,

687
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,080
that's easy to scan.

688
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,889
If I'm the hiring manager,

689
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,260
am I picking up the skills, am
I picking up the experience,

690
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,410
is it something that, okay, I
got it, this is a candidate.

691
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,410
I understand what they're after.

692
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,540
Things are clear.

693
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,730
So it really is about clarity

694
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,570
when you're creating that resume.

695
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,570
Also you want to be clear with education.

696
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,830
So for me, it really is all about clarity,

697
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,929
is it easy to take a look at,

698
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,270
have you use action words,

699
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,389
is it full of fluff
which I never recommend?

700
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,810
Make sure you're true to
your actual experience

701
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,543
when you're creating the resume.

702
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,840
Other things to be careful of,

703
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,389
you want to make sure that you are not

704
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,600
including any type of bad
grammar or spelling errors.

705
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,490
You would be amazed how many times

706
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,580
I have seen a resume
with grammatical errors,

707
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,913
poor formatting is another one,

708
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,950
you want to make sure that
the length is one page.

709
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,910
If you can keep it at one page,

710
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,513
you want to have one page.

711
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,929
No manager wants to get
a resume with two, three

712
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,402
four or five pages and I have seen them

713
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,490
and I'm sure Sarah and Brent
have seen them as well.

714
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,840
So you're not submitting a book,

715
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,010
again, it's a summary of your experience.

716
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,410
And I have seen them where

717
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,960
professional summary has been excluded.

718
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,150
So right away that will throw me off.

719
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,423
So you want to make sure
you're addressing those items.

720
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,209
Of course your name should
be at the top and in bold,

721
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,800
that information should be clear,

722
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,733
your contact information.

723
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,990
What else?

724
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,843
And the professional summary again,

725
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,160
you'll hear me say this again,

726
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,800
the fluff portion,

727
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,513
that is something that I see very often,

728
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,380
lots of words, does it
make it even better?

729
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,380
So it just goes back to being clear.

730
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,260
Sarah and Brent, is there anything else

731
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,490
you know anything you've seen in resumes

732
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,233
that you want to you
let people know about?

733
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,580
- Brent you're on mute.

734
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:15,429
- [Brent] I think to your point
about the grammatical errors

735
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,550
nothing negates the
statement, detail oriented

736
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,743
like a lot of grammar (chuckles) errors.

737
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:27,650
- Yeah, so one thing that I noticed,

738
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,480
so I notice it in presentations,

739
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,480
I notice it in resumes is be
consistent in your formatting.

740
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,401
At the end of a sentence, either
use punctuations or don't,

741
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:45,723
but don't mix it up because
I notice it every time

742
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:48,450
no matter how senior or
how junior the candidate

743
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,960
and it's my pet peeve.

744
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,000
What I will say

745
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,090
and we had something of a
fiery conversation around us

746
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,879
with Paula, Brent and I when
we were talking about this

747
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,661
I don't like objective statements.

748
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:03,620
(Sarah laughing)

749
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,280
Because honestly as the hiring manager,

750
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,480
I don't really care
what your objective is.

751
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,350
I care about who you are.

752
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,909
Your objective is to get
a job hopefully with us

753
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,650
and it's a match made in heaven.

754
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,440
So to me

755
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,420
I would rather have it just
be a statement that says

756
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,270
we'll use John DOE,

757
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,520
even though we don't
like John's resume here,

758
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,730
you know...

759
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,520
Yeah, I can't even work with that one

760
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,403
but basically say,

761
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,800
detail oriented, collegial,

762
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,623
innovative thinker,

763
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,250
solving technology problems.

764
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,060
Like I would rather a statement
about sort of who you are

765
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,649
and how you show up going
back to sort of Camille

766
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,990
like what is your unique
selling proposition

767
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,060
rather than what do you want?

768
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,513
Because it comes back to,
at the end of the day,

769
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,100
like hiring managers are
looking to solve their problems.

770
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,929
So they're not looking
to solve your problem.

771
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:14,929
The ideal situation is if your
objective matches their need.

772
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,050
So I personally don't use objective.

773
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,909
I would rather use...

774
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,862
I do like a statement
above that sort of is

775
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:25,509
cures your USP, but that's personal.

776
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,420
So I wouldn't throw out a
resume that had an objective

777
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,280
but I think you always have
to remember what your that...

778
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,780
What you're trying to do is
you're trying to have them

779
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,090
think that you're fabulous
so that you can decide

780
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,190
whether you think the company is fabulous.

781
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,239
So that would be my
sort of add on to Paula.

782
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,689
Sorry.

783
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,400
- I'm gonna jump in with one question

784
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,536
for you Paula please from chat

785
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:53,850
which is, is page count
true for executive roles

786
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,902
or people with 15 plus
years of experience?

787
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,030
- Yeah, I mean we hire
people at executive levels

788
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,190
and they don't hand in...

789
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,850
They're not submitting a 10 page resume.

790
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,759
I think there's a way to
express the experience

791
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,820
in one to two pages.

792
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,960
And remember, you're
going into an interview.

793
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,820
So if I have contacted
you about the interview,

794
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,880
I know upfront, okay,

795
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,910
this person has 15 plus
years of experience,

796
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,870
I will be looking for that to come out

797
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,490
during the interview.

798
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,700
So there is a way to
summarize the experience

799
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,843
in a way that you don't
have so many pages.

800
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,013
- Super, thank you so much, Paula.

801
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,680
Brent, we're gonna transition to you.

802
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,759
So we've talked about

803
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,217
make sure you understand
the job description

804
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:53,010
and how to tailor your
discussion to the particular job.

805
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,990
Now let's look at,

806
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,830
let's pivot to which I think
Camille covered very nicely

807
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,920
in her session, which is
creating your own opportunities.

808
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,630
Brent, can you take us through this

809
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,690
with some interchange with
Paula and Sarah as well?

810
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,760
And again audience

811
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,450
feel free to use chat
window for questions.

812
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,549
- Sure, so I'm Brent Knoll.

813
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,626
I work for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc,

814
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,784
and I have responsibility

815
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:19,736
for the engineering and development teams

816
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:23,819
in our incident management space.

817
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,880
So building your network.

818
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,200
Participate in events that
lend themselves to networking

819
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,966
with people in the industry
like Security BSides

820
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:35,950
or find capture the flag
events to participate in

821
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,490
and build a team.

822
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,680
And these are excellent
networking opportunities

823
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,462
for industry leaders
attend to source talent.

824
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,330
Attend industry hiring events,

825
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,890
look for cybersecurity focused events

826
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,710
as well as technology conferences.

827
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,350
A lot of these have moved
to an online format.

828
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,540
We've got the Women in
Cybersecurity Conference coming up

829
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,170
that's called the Diana Initiative.

830
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,080
And it's less than the
cost of a cup of coffee

831
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,990
from Starbucks.

832
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,330
It's five bucks and it's free to students.

833
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,477
Utilize social media applications

834
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,450
like LinkedIn to see who's hiring.

835
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,000
A lot of recruiters or hiring managers

836
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,443
will post saying

837
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:20,939
I need this skillset or
I'm hiring for this role.

838
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,640
And use your connections
to establish pipeline

839
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,480
for relationships and
mentoring opportunities.

840
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,190
There are many people out
there who wanna mentor

841
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,860
and give back to the community

842
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,003
and they also wanna identify talent

843
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:33,253
and fill roles in their organizations.

844
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,480
So I'm gonna move on to being strategic.

845
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,690
This is your livelihood, it's your career.

846
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,949
You wanna invest your time wisely

847
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:43,130
and focus on opportunities
that are worth pursuing.

848
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,210
Do your research on the organizations.

849
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,360
You're applying to read
reviews on sites like Glassdoor

850
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,544
or look at the list of top places

851
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:51,453
and companies to work for.

852
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,357
Reach out to some of your contacts

853
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,860
that may currently be employed there

854
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,090
or have recently worked there.

855
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,275
You don't wanna start out on a lower rung

856
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,380
on the proverbial career ladder

857
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,210
then it's absolutely necessary.

858
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,170
And right now it's a job
seekers market in cybersecurity.

859
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,630
So here's my most
important takeaway for you.

860
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,560
You were interviewing that organization,

861
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,930
their culture to see if
it is a good fit for you

862
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,883
and your skills as much as
they're interviewing you.

863
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,339
Are you filling a need

864
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,380
or are they looking at you

865
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,490
as a long-term investment opportunity?

866
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,482
If it's not the latter, I would
have some serious concerns.

867
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,740
If you do not have a
lot of work experience,

868
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,120
be prepared to use your school
projects to answer questions.

869
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,819
This work's applicable so
use it in your responses.

870
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,290
And I'll use the example of
like PCAP is PCAP is PCAP

871
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,580
whether in a lab environment
or in a production setting.

872
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,723
And this goes for other relevant skills.

873
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,730
The best interviews are a good story.

874
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,860
And it's your story.

875
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,963
So make sure that you're
taking time to practice it.

876
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,020
When I was coming out of school

877
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,030
the thing that stood out on my resume

878
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,680
had zero to do with any of
the jobs I was applying for.

879
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,270
But I had worked the previous
summer as a park ranger

880
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,850
for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

881
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,670
And it was a great ice breaker.

882
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,603
It came up in every interview
that I participated in.

883
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,323
And it allowed me to
steer the conversation

884
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,569
to the skills they were looking for.

885
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,770
I was able to talk about

886
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,320
how I was able to deal
with difficult people

887
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,793
in the recreation areas.

888
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,290
And it was also something
that made me unique

889
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,123
as a candidate.

890
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,393
I was the park ranger.

891
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,460
So moving onto our last topic,

892
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,740
focus on the skills that employers want.

893
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,529
If you see certificates or specific skills

894
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,170
to multiple job descriptions
and you don't have them,

895
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,570
you may take some time and obtain them.

896
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,560
Utilize online training like Udemy,

897
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,690
LinkedIn Learning or Hack The Box.

898
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,400
Be able to speak those
items that you don't have

899
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,790
but may pursue when you have
the necessary work experience.

900
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,150
Like the CIA SSP requires

901
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,240
that candidate has five
years paid work experience

902
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,060
in two or more of the eight domains.

903
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,680
This isn't something
you're likely gonna have

904
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,841
coming out of school.

905
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,250
However most organizations

906
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,323
will help you obtain these certificates.

907
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,703
Once you were in seat and
you meet the prerequisites.

908
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,839
Keep in mind the tech...

909
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,030
While the technical
skills are very important,

910
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,370
soft skills are important too

911
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,009
and companies are looking for these.

912
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,980
So think about ways to
demonstrate these skills

913
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
during your interview or on your resume.

914
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,620
Like how well do you communicate?

915
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,120
Are you a critical thinker?

916
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,330
Can you identify and solve problems?

917
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,482
And provide responses that
prove that you have any skills?

918
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,580
Do we have any questions?

919
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,290
- I have one that has come in

920
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,240
that might be interesting
to pull Sarah into as well.

921
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,470
So Sarah, Paula, Brent,

922
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,850
the triangular here,

923
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,779
for a recent graduate student

924
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,830
is it recommended to write objective

925
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,220
or professional summary in your resume?

926
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,899
If yes what are the suggestions
for what to include?

927
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,870
So, Sarah, you might set us off in here

928
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,600
with this objective thing.

929
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,935
What are your thoughts experts?

930
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:12,070
- (clears throat) Well,

931
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,810
I'm a professional summary person.

932
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,060
I think, also the reality is

933
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,110
over time you're gonna
wish you had more space

934
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,480
especially as you get more seasoned

935
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,030
as we say in the business

936
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,180
that you're gonna have had

937
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,890
more and more and more experiences

938
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,200
and you have to start pairing them down.

939
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,240
So in an early career you're gonna...

940
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,729
You wanna fill up space,

941
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,950
as you get later career,

942
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,040
you wanna sort of take
out every extra space,

943
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,430
have space possible.

944
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,100
So I would just take
out the word altogether

945
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,200
and then just use a descriptive
series of sentences.

946
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,919
You know, problem-solving,

947
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,920
globally experienced researcher, whatever.

948
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:07,180
It doesn't have to be perfect,

949
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,000
it just needs to be punchy.

950
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,660
And if you go to sort of marketing 101,

951
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,796
or you even just Google
unique selling proposition,

952
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:20,069
that's what you're doing
in the top of your resume.

953
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,200
So that's my view on it

954
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,942
but Paula and Brent
might have another view.

955
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,640
- Yeah, it's basically
how are you capturing

956
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:37,129
that attention right
away with that summary.

957
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,293
So, I mean, if you're a software engineer,

958
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
enthusiastic software engineer

959
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,800
with two, five years experience

960
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,593
dot dot dot just a quick
summary of who you are,

961
00:42:55,295 --> 00:43:00,295
and then we go into your
actual skills and experience.

962
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,820
- I also think that's a time...

963
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,140
I mean, I really, Paula,
this was really good.

964
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,279
I also think it's an opportunity

965
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,240
for you to call out something
that might not be obvious,

966
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,700
multilingual-
- Oh, yeah.

967
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,203
- Or, like, or

968
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,770
if you've lived in multiple countries,

969
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,750
that's where you can use
globally experienced,

970
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,180
doesn't mean you've worked

971
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,359
but if you've navigated someplace else

972
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:35,779
and that works whether you're an expert

973
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,900
or not, right?

974
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,270
So it's what makes you...

975
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,890
It's your opportunity to
sort of give the banner

976
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,180
of what makes you uniquely you

977
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,930
so that they want to dive...

978
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,529
They're excited to dive
more deeply into the resume.

979
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,640
- Brent, I have, I actually
have two more questions

980
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,069
but we have time for one
more question for you.

981
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,340
And then for others in the chat panel

982
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,730
remember our panelists will be available

983
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,185
in the breakout rooms as well

984
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:07,009
because you've got some
excellent questions for them.

985
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,610
So, Brent, the question for you is

986
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,173
what advice would you
give to your younger self?

987
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,897
- Well, that's a (laughs)

988
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:21,190
- [Britta] (laughs) That's a deep one.

989
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,023
- It is.

990
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,300
I think it was...

991
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,530
The thing I think about

992
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,970
that when I reflect back on my career,

993
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,589
there's been a couple
of times where I thought

994
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,060
I should say no to a job
and I got talked into it.

995
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:43,060
And ultimately I spent three,
four years in that role

996
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,500
and there ended up being
some learnings from it

997
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,150
but the big learning was,

998
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,510
I should have pursued the
position that I wanted

999
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,673
and not settled.

1000
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,430
- That's excellent advice.

1001
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,263
Thank you.

1002
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,580
Thank you panelists very much.

1003
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,040
And again, there'll be in
the Zoom breakout rooms

1004
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,854
at the conclusion of this workshop.

1005
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:09,029
So shifting gears,

1006
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,240
I am very pleased to be able to,

1007
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,060
assuming I get there, my mouse worked yay!

1008
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,299
Introduced to two very
talented individuals from Dell

1009
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,520
who we've talked about the resume now,

1010
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,823
we've talked about creating
opportunities for yourself,

1011
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:25,129
so now we're to the interview.

1012
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:28,130
How do you best present yourself.

1013
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,320
Again questions welcome and chat.

1014
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,520
Christine and Carrie, thank you very much.

1015
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,643
Please take it away.

1016
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,480
- Hello everyone, my colleague,
Carrie, Patrick and I

1017
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,320
are both from Dell Technologies

1018
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,620
and are part of the security

1019
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,424
and resiliency organization there.

1020
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:45,180
And we lead the talent management team

1021
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,419
and are responsible for
hiring internship program

1022
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,330
and team member development.

1023
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,997
Today, we're super excited to join you

1024
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:55,000
and share some tips and
tricks for interviewing

1025
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,420
as well as some suggestions

1026
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,970
for how to prepare for interviews.

1027
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,031
Starting with the tips for interviewing.

1028
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:02,990
The first one is practice.

1029
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,370
Preparing for an interview

1030
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,440
should be like studying for a test.

1031
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,160
By practicing you are better prepared

1032
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,089
and able to showcase
what you have to offer.

1033
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,290
The more comfortable you are

1034
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,110
at articulating your
background, your interests,

1035
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,547
and what you will bring
to the company and role,

1036
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:19,498
the better your interview is gonna go.

1037
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:23,373
We have some sample questions
that I will go over shortly.

1038
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,750
Research the company.

1039
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,150
Always do your homework
on what the company does

1040
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,650
and be able to articulate
what about that interests you.

1041
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,010
A common question that
I like to ask candidates

1042
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,020
is why are you interested
in working for Dell?

1043
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,000
And I'm looking for answers

1044
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,210
that show that candidates
have taken some time

1045
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,530
to look over our website

1046
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,000
and that they give answers
that really reflect

1047
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,210
on how the company gives
back to the community

1048
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,287
or some cool technology that
they really wanna work on,

1049
00:46:49,287 --> 00:46:51,419
and that interests them.

1050
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,801
Make sure your phone is on silent.

1051
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:55,480
There is nothing that's more distracting

1052
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,313
or really irritating

1053
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,610
than having your phone going
off during an interview.

1054
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,770
And in addition to the noise
that really distracts you

1055
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,330
from concentrating and being
able to share your story

1056
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,680
with who you're talking to.

1057
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,020
Create a list of your accomplishments.

1058
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,870
And Carrie is going to
cover this in more detail

1059
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,770
in a couple of minutes,

1060
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:13,030
but really take time to think through

1061
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,300
some of your achievements that you've made

1062
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,340
and be able to properly articulate those

1063
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,390
during the interview.

1064
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:22,350
Have a list of questions you
can ask your interviewer.

1065
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,120
Being prepared with some questions

1066
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,660
shows that you are genuinely
interested in the role

1067
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,399
and that you have taken
time to craft the questions.

1068
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,250
They can be about the company, the role

1069
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,070
or the team in general that
you would be working with.

1070
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,350
Send a thank you.

1071
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,190
Unfortunately, this has
really become a lost art

1072
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,460
but you will definitely set yourself apart

1073
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,500
from other candidates

1074
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,550
by taking time to craft a thank you email

1075
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,550
to the interview team.

1076
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,330
We recommended sending this out

1077
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,120
within 24 hours of the interview

1078
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,810
to keep you fresh in their minds.

1079
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,049
And go slow.

1080
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,570
Listen to what the questions are

1081
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,390
and really take time to
formulate your responses.

1082
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,650
Again be sure to properly articulate

1083
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,725
what you have accomplished

1084
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:02,380
and how you would handle
certain situations

1085
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,490
and really take your time
in sharing your story.

1086
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,323
Next slide.

1087
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,129
As I mentioned, a couple of minutes ago

1088
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,680
here are some of the
behavioral interview questions.

1089
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,890
Most companies will ask you
a combination of technical

1090
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,299
or job-related questions

1091
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,420
as well as these behavioral
type interview questions.

1092
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,940
And what we're really wanting you to do

1093
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,030
is to tell about a time in your past

1094
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,850
where you have done something.

1095
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,170
You wanna describe the steps

1096
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,670
or actions you took in
order to accomplish this

1097
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,340
and share what the outcome
of your actions were.

1098
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,620
An example of a behavioral question is,

1099
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,040
tell me about a time
that you were successful

1100
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,050
in taking charge and providing leadership

1101
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,376
during a class project.

1102
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,013
You wanna craft your response

1103
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:47,880
to reflect on a time in class

1104
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,460
that you led your group project.

1105
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,120
Describe what that project was in detail,

1106
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,180
describe how or why you took charge,

1107
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,660
and how that was received
by your classmates.

1108
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,049
And then finally explain
what the final outcome

1109
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,443
of that project was.

1110
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,228
Some behavioral questions
may be negative in nature

1111
00:49:04,228 --> 00:49:06,210
and ask you to reflect on a time

1112
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,670
where you weren't successful.

1113
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,740
The intent of these is
to see how you learned

1114
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,807
from your mistakes and
handled the situation

1115
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:16,359
and how you would deal with
that differently in the future.

1116
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,699
An example of this type of question

1117
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:20,130
is describe a time when you wish

1118
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,390
you would have been more
collaborative with others.

1119
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,170
Give an honest answer of
a time that this happened.

1120
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,210
Share the situation why
you weren't collaborative

1121
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,498
and what the outcome was.

1122
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:33,700
And also take time to share
what you would do differently

1123
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,962
if you were put in that situation again.

1124
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,410
I'm gonna go ahead and hand
it over to Carrie Patrick

1125
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,299
to take on some examples of
how to craft your achievements.

1126
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,080
- Very good, thank you.

1127
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,049
So Camille talked us
through some of this already

1128
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,520
but I have a little bit
of a formula so to say

1129
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,925
that you can use

1130
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:57,550
as you're thinking of things
to say during your interview,

1131
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,570
I would encourage everybody
to take like an hour or so

1132
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,270
and just think through all of the things

1133
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,880
that you've been through.

1134
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,040
And in a sense, you're
trying to paint a word with

1135
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,650
or a picture with your words.

1136
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,370
So the interviewer gets
a better understanding

1137
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:16,029
of what your skills are and
the challenges that you faced.

1138
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,220
So a few tips,

1139
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,069
an achievement is just a moment in time.

1140
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,370
It begins and it ends

1141
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:23,940
and there was a result of it at the end.

1142
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,750
Keep them brief just two
to four lines in length.

1143
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,980
And you wanna start each
sentence with a past tense verb.

1144
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,730
So something that you did in
the past that you completed

1145
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,980
and don't draw any attention to specifics

1146
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,470
like the name of the
company that you work for

1147
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,890
or the product or the location,

1148
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,180
really the emphasis is about
you, it's on your skills.

1149
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,750
So I gave some examples,
like just very simply,

1150
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,020
created some PowerBI dashboards
for capacity planning,

1151
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,930
32% increase in the
operational efficiency.

1152
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,290
And so you can see here

1153
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,230
that this person has taken
some time to pull out

1154
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,591
some of the things that they've done.

1155
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:59,944
And if you got that list ready

1156
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,870
before you go into an interview

1157
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,900
or now most of them are online,

1158
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,700
so you can keep them next to you

1159
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,080
and see what you've done
and refer to them quickly.

1160
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,529
You can go to the next slide.

1161
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:16,923
And last,

1162
00:51:16,923 --> 00:51:20,403
so we're mostly doing
interviews on Zoom now.

1163
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,569
I think one of the most
important things to do

1164
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:28,500
is create the space ahead
of time and practice it.

1165
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,990
Perhaps if you can do the
Zoom call with a friend,

1166
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,709
pretend like you're already
doing the interview,

1167
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,450
put yourself in the same
space that you're gonna be in,

1168
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:40,410
dress up as you normally
would for an interview,

1169
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,359
ensure that you're in a quiet space,

1170
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,400
like go through all of the same motions

1171
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,440
that you're gonna have to on the interview

1172
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,850
to get yourself ready,

1173
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,060
and then have things up on the screen

1174
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,770
that you can refer to easily.

1175
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,820
Like those lists of career achievements,

1176
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,810
the questions that you
have for their interview,

1177
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,220
just brief info on the company,
the job description itself

1178
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,939
just make your life a little easier

1179
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,850
and you don't have to
put it all in your head.

1180
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,279
So I wanna stop there

1181
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,630
and see if there's any
questions in the chat

1182
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,980
that's come through for us.

1183
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,650
- Couple questions that have come through.

1184
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,730
Excellent and you can phone a friend too

1185
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,790
on some of these questions,
if you'd like to as well.

1186
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,100
And I do wanna let everyone know

1187
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,156
these slides will be available in the VE.

1188
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:26,190
There's some great content in here

1189
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,050
and they will be there for you.

1190
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,480
Let me start with, is it recommended...

1191
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,972
Well here, actually, let
me start with this one.

1192
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:35,503
How do you pivot into information security

1193
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:40,170
from a traditional IT role
such as system administrator?

1194
00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:44,922
Go ahead.

1195
00:52:44,922 --> 00:52:45,964
- I phoned a friend on that line.

1196
00:52:45,964 --> 00:52:48,631
(both laughing)

1197
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,606
Actually can you repeat
the question for me?

1198
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:54,543
- You bet.

1199
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:57,258
How do you pivot into information security

1200
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:01,924
from a traditional IT role
such as system administrator?

1201
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:08,040
- Well for us in the security resiliency,

1202
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,040
we have a lot of more
operations type roles

1203
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:18,080
that are able to pull in
a more generic skillset

1204
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,990
or if you've had different experience.

1205
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,356
And then as you get more ingrained

1206
00:53:22,356 --> 00:53:25,080
in our security organization,

1207
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,970
you can just start to fine tune

1208
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,109
those really specific security skills

1209
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,830
and get more and more trainings

1210
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,232
and offered different
opportunities on different teams

1211
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:35,483
to learn and grow.

1212
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,890
- I have a really good one

1213
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,190
for those of us stuck in
a Zoom world right here.

1214
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,120
Does it look good if you're
looking at another screen?

1215
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,569
Would it be like taking
notes to the interviewer?

1216
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,333
- I think it's fine.

1217
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,020
So there's no rule that says

1218
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,250
like you have to be staring

1219
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,070
right at the camera
directly in front of you.

1220
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,430
And I would like, as whenever
I'm doing interviewing

1221
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,830
I would let people know, like
I'm gonna be taking notes

1222
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,950
during the interview just
to give them a heads up.

1223
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,470
And if they're doing the
same, that's totally fine.

1224
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,669
I think as long as you're present

1225
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,300
and it's clear you're paying attention

1226
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,418
and you're responding to the
questions I'm asking you,

1227
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,803
that's really the thing that I care about.

1228
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:23,009
- Wonderful, how do you feel about the um

1229
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,920
or long pause in an interview

1230
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,523
after you ask someone a question?

1231
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,640
- I think they're taking
their time to formulate,

1232
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,220
to really digest the question

1233
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,359
and then to formulate
what their response is.

1234
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,660
So I think it's kind of a staler,

1235
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,720
but definitely would rather you do that

1236
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,689
than to either just
give a yes or no answer

1237
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,573
and, or not answer it.

1238
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,400
- Super, and a final question for you,

1239
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,780
in an in-person interview

1240
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,500
can you bring an outline of
your professional summary

1241
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,930
and questions for your own reference,

1242
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,919
worrying, I guess it's your crib sheet,

1243
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,010
making sure you don't miss
out on highlighting anything

1244
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,210
that you really wanna make sure
is covered in the interview.

1245
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,610
How would you react to that?

1246
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,193
- I think it's great.

1247
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:14,840
I think to me it signals, you're prepared,

1248
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,030
you've thought ahead, you wanted like..

1249
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,707
You value the questions that you have

1250
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,870
and you wanna make sure
that you get the answers

1251
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,819
that you're looking for.

1252
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,610
So, I wouldn't expect
anyone to hold everything

1253
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,630
all of it in their head,

1254
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,210
but it gets great if
they've taken the time

1255
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,630
to make a list and prepare, yeah.

1256
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,500
- Excellent.

1257
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,340
I'm gonna sneak one more in,

1258
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,630
because it's a good one.

1259
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,234
Sorry, everyone.

1260
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:41,210
Okay, I had an interview with a company

1261
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,210
that I was deeply interested in.

1262
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,750
How should I feel if they did
not have their cameras on?

1263
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,760
I was the only one with the camera on.

1264
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,883
I wasn't sure what that meant.

1265
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,330
- Wow, so would, they
were at the interview

1266
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,900
and they were the only
one with the camera on,

1267
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,560
and then they didn't hear
back after the interview?

1268
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,828
Is that the question?
- That I do not know.

1269
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:05,390
- What was the first part?
- Its the how...

1270
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,350
How should they feel?

1271
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,299
They're there, they're on the camera,

1272
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,460
they're showing their face

1273
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,339
and the other faces are not joining them.

1274
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,661
- Yeah, so a lot of the
times I think it might be...

1275
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,780
Christine you chime in

1276
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,720
if there's something different
about this you wanna say,

1277
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,859
but it's like a cultural thing.

1278
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,120
Like some companies everybody's always on

1279
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,680
and their faces are showing,
and it's just this expectation

1280
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,960
that you're gonna be on the video.

1281
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,190
And then there's other companies
where that's not the case.

1282
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,820
And even within the
securities, (indistinct) Dell

1283
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,730
like I noticed, there's some teams of ours

1284
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,100
that are always up on video

1285
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,620
and then others that aren't

1286
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,779
so more than likely it's
just they like a norm

1287
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,313
that exists in that world that they're in.

1288
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,990
- That's really good guidance.

1289
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,660
Thank you, thank you for being with us.

1290
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,850
And we've got a lot of
people here in the house.

1291
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,110
Thank you all for being
here with us as well.

1292
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:00,110
For the next portion of our workshop,

1293
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,560
if we were in person, we'd
be moving between rooms

1294
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,120
and have this opportunity to
have your resumes reviewed

1295
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,490
and specific feedback.

1296
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,660
Again, all of our
participants today welcome,

1297
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,129
you're reaching out to them via social

1298
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,700
for additional follow up with them.

1299
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,750
But we have the wonderful
opportunity today to,

1300
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,400
we're gonna break out into Zoom rooms.

1301
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,996
You're going to be randomly
assigned into a room

1302
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:25,530
with one of these wonderful HR reps

1303
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,350
to have smaller conversations.

1304
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,130
As you've heard from Camille and Brent

1305
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,060
really, really emphasized
in his portion as well.

1306
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,490
This network's important.

1307
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,069
And this is a really
great opportunity for you

1308
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,780
to meet face-to-face with
some of these great reps.

1309
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,330
And I know there were
some additional questions

1310
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,529
that came through in chat,

1311
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,220
feel free to share those questions there.

1312
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,459
You're welcome to move
into other rooms as well.

1313
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,770
So you'll just leave that room,

1314
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,850
you come back into this main area

1315
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,140
and you'll be assigned into another room.

1316
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,810
So thank you for being here with us.

1317
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,216
Please enjoy this next
portion of the workshop

1318
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:00,839
and the opportunity to meet directly

1319
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,360
with one of our wonderful panelists.

1320
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,850
And panelists thank you
so much for your time

1321
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,450
and expertise that you
shared with us today as well.
