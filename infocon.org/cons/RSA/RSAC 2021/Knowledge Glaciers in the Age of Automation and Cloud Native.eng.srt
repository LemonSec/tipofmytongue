1
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:02,890
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,040
I'm Emily Fox.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,080
Thank you so much for taking
the time to join me today.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,670
I'll be talking to you, wonderful people

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,710
about knowledge glaciers
and the disappearance

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,400
of institutional knowledge.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,100
I'm available for Q and A
throughout this presentation

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,143
so don't be afraid to
jump in and ask questions.

9
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,150
However, before we get started,

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,820
I wanted to cover some base rules.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,720
I do not possess a degree
and knowledge or history.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,590
My degrees are in information
systems and cybersecurity.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,950
I'm not a computer
scientist, software engineer

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,430
or system administrator.

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,740
I'm a security person through and through.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,210
The information I'm going to discuss

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,600
in this presentation is derived

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,110
from over a decade of industry

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,630
and government observation,
reporting and research.

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,350
They're not an official position

21
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,570
of my current or previous
and past employers.

22
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,570
Many roles, industries and organizations

23
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,240
are discussed in this presentation.

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,530
One is not better than another.

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,560
And I intend to present
the actions and effects

26
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,920
of each of these in an
observational manner,

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,290
focusing more on the knowledge impact

28
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,150
and the impact to security.

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,730
So let's get started.

30
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,303
Knowledge glaciers are
real and they are melting.

31
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,060
If you don't know what a glacier is

32
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,900
or may have forgotten elementary science

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,070
here's a refresher.

34
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,960
A glacier is a slowly
moving massive river,

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,830
an ice formed by the accumulation

36
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,190
and compaction of snow on
mountains or near poles.

37
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,259
And they're melting.

38
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,475
Scientific research has shown
the overall massive glaciers

39
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,850
on earth is reducing at an alarming rate

40
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,710
due to environmental factors
beyond the glaciers control.

41
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,970
There's just vaguely familiar to you,

42
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,460
it seems like nearly
everything that happened

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,850
in 2020 is beyond our control.

44
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,770
According to the national snow
and ice data center or NSIDC,

45
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,580
glacial ice often appears blue

46
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,929
when it becomes very
dense and free of bubbles.

47
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,240
Years of compression
gradually make the ice denser

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,880
over time forcing out the tiny
air pockets between crystals.

49
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,509
When glacial ice becomes extremely dense

50
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,640
the ice absorbs a small
amount of red light,

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,690
leaving a bluish tint
in the reflected light

52
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,009
which is what we see.

53
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,220
This means the oldest and
purest parts of the glacier

54
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,253
are the bluest.

55
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,700
So what does that have to do
with knowledge and security?

56
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,310
Well, there's these things
called knowledge glaciers.

57
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,370
They're the accumulation and compaction

58
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,210
of deep knowledge built over time

59
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,070
that provides foundational understanding

60
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,070
as community knowledge
expands in a particular area

61
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,359
or around a particular technology.

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,800
And guess what they're melting too.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,760
The advancement of technology,
expansion of automation,

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
consolidation of expertise
and many other factors

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,690
are reducing the amount
of and the completeness

66
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,270
of institutional knowledge
being transferred

67
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,710
from one technology
generation to the next.

68
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,960
Over half a century of
technology expertise

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,340
have forged glaciers of knowledge.

70
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,700
Accumulating and transferring
this dense mass of knowledge

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,200
is difficult and hard
to successfully perform

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,380
within a team, let alone
an entire community.

73
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,850
Years of knowledge compression
have gradually made the depth

74
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,140
and breadth of knowledge denser over time,

75
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,049
forcing out the tiny time specific

76
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,300
and application specific
pockets of knowledge

77
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,020
between innovation bursts.

78
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,390
What remains is a pure
foundation of knowledge

79
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,102
from which innovation is
born and then commoditized.

80
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,320
Now as with glacial melt,

81
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,370
there are environmental
factors to consider.

82
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,260
Expected productivity and velocity.

83
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,070
A culture of curiosity
that generated innovation

84
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,269
and upheaval is disappearing.

85
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,900
Knowledge gained is evaporating

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
because we are so busy
trying to move forward

87
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,160
faster than everyone else.

88
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,590
This leaves security in the dust for teams

89
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,420
without a security Sherpa.

90
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,809
For technologists to be
productive immediately,

91
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,490
they cannot act on the information

92
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,200
to make informed decisions.

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
Justice security practitioners

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
often apply security requirements

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
without enough information to
determine their feasibility

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,300
or even applicability, it's
check listing and moving on.

97
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,370
And this technologists
are being herded in mass

98
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,510
to produce an object,

99
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,049
a thing to be the cash
cow of an organization.

100
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,310
If it's not making cash

101
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,253
how is it helping to make cash?

102
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,549
Career alignment.

103
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,870
Career goals are tied to product delivery.

104
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,610
A lot of individuals see the success

105
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,560
of developer advocates and big
personalities and open source

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,260
as the alignment of stars
for where they wanna be.

107
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,179
They see the product launch
of a highly enviable project

108
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,950
as the trajectory for
their own personal success.

109
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,480
Some in the community, even hunt

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,890
for the next cutting edge innovation

111
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,310
to either launch them and to start them

112
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,490
in the community or wealth to
move on to the next big thing.

113
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,260
Organizations even encourage
them to this model of thinking

114
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,039
because it drives product development

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,790
further feeding that cash cow.

116
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,580
Organizations today need to reach

117
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,520
beyond horizon one to
horizon two and three.

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,109
But in reaching these goals,
organizations end up trampling

119
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,800
on the knowledge and growth
of the individual to get there

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,550
if they do not carefully nurture

121
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,363
their continuation and advancement.

122
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,300
Cloud.

123
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,970
The birth of utility computing

124
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,980
or as a service anything
in the early 2000s

125
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,710
shifted industry away from
self management of hardware,

126
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,280
power space, schooling, racking,

127
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,933
and stacking cable management.

128
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,690
As with most innovations security

129
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,300
is only now beginning to
catch up in this space.

130
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,400
Technology companies attempting
to offer utility computing

131
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,599
began to sweep talent pools
of highly skilled, experienced

132
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,050
and costly individuals to make
their offerings more robust

133
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,260
were resilient and competitive
with this emerging market.

134
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,159
Companies that began adopting as a service

135
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,140
to reduce their IT costs ended
up decreasing local demand

136
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,320
for hardware, engineers,
and administrators

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,730
and therefore the needs
have shifted again.

138
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,150
Few reinvested in these human assets

139
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,719
to keep institutional knowledge
and expand relevant skills.

140
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,890
This move labor needs to service providers

141
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,810
ultimately consolidating
infrastructure management knowledge

142
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,700
and leaving an entire
formerly desired community

143
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,360
to abandon and suppress knowledge

144
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,930
and take up a new trade graph

145
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,970
or evolve to meet the new market demands

146
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,840
for which very few had expertise

147
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,022
and outside of the service providers.

148
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,479
Automation.

149
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,610
Cloud service providers
themselves felt the IT cost burden

150
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,260
and have been increasing automation

151
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,490
to continually lower overhead
costs and increase revenue.

152
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,710
Automation of orchestration
consolidates more knowledge

153
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,890
and further dilutes the
skills, history, and expertise

154
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,940
for which it's manual
antiseptic was created.

155
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,910
Automation does many things, however,

156
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,170
does many amazing things, however.

157
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,160
Manual processes and procedures
that used to be error prone

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,580
and probably still are

159
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,680
can now be defined and
exercised repeatedly

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,660
and with the same expected results.

161
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,120
You do it once and it
is applied many times

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,370
over throughout an entire enterprise.

163
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,520
That knowledge, however about
why we do it a particular way

164
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,330
is not captured in this
automation process.

165
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,859
Simply the manner in which is being used

166
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,170
to accomplish the feat,
not the reasons behind it.

167
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,940
The vast majority of developers
assume the next person

168
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,330
to read their code is just like them.

169
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,950
And therefore their comments are lacking

170
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,300
or not intelligible.

171
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,850
If a section of code was deleted

172
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,540
most organizations would not understand

173
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,270
the impact based on the
comment within that section.

174
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,570
Moreover, most coaches not even revisited

175
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,020
but commented out and left
there to be manipulated

176
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,510
at a later date by a
potentially malicious actor

177
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,250
or inserted following the
same comment out pattern

178
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,053
to play a waiting game
before adding it back in.

179
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,840
Cloud service providers in an
effort to protect themselves

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,070
from their customers and their
customers from each other

181
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,000
institute layers of specialized
controls and abstractions

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,690
limiting just how much you can tweak

183
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,290
and configure their offerings.

184
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,380
They need to make it easier

185
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,750
and faster for their customers to move

186
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,490
on to the next big thing,
without having to spend time,

187
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,490
energy and effort
researching all the nuances

188
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,020
of a particular product.

189
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,390
And their customers want this.

190
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,090
In many cases, the manner and mechanism

191
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,049
by which this is performed
is kept confidential

192
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,720
and proprietary because the
methods that enable the level

193
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,490
of abstraction can provide,

194
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,400
and in many cases do
provide market advantage.

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,599
This makes it extremely
difficult to understand how

196
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,830
a cloud provider is meeting
compliance, security

197
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,690
and regulatory requirements.

198
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,160
Aside from a certifications
bodies, such as FedRAMP

199
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,050
or a certification
standard, such as FIPS 140-2

200
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,350
being attested consumers are left to trust

201
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,773
but often unable to verify these claims.

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
So we're at a point now where
you're probably wondering

203
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,970
why the security person is talking

204
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,490
about knowledge and glaciers
and early technology.

205
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,650
It must have something
to do with security.

206
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,799
Or even a modern technology
and where we're at today.

207
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,040
So there are two points that
I want to have you consider

208
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,590
an interview open throughout
this presentation.

209
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,229
So be mindful.

210
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,540
Without knowledge, we cannot be informed.

211
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,773
If we're not informed,
we cannot be secure.

212
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,740
Consolidation and automation
makes security life easier.

213
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,400
Consolidation and automation
without transparency

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,732
can obscure and inhibit actual security.

215
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,080
Security professionals and technologists

216
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,340
cannot just know they're
part of the development cycle

217
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,450
or their fiefdom and be done with it.

218
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,530
We must also have knowledge
of the technology,

219
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,089
how it fits into the bigger picture,

220
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,500
the history of the technology,
to a certain extent

221
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,450
how it arrived here, historical
vulnerabilities for it

222
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,100
because it meant inevitably
someone will fail

223
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,550
to implement a regression
test for at least one of them.

224
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,089
If we're not appropriately informed

225
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,540
about how functions
work and why it is done,

226
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,630
especially why, we cannot make
appropriate recommendations

227
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,770
to mitigate resolver transfer risk.

228
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,120
This is the exact same thing
that project teams need

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,200
to understand before they can
begin developing a product.

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,300
Identifying what the actual problem is

231
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,120
before we can design a product to solve it

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
and identifying what the product will do

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,960
in order to secure it.

234
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,680
While consolidating reporting streams

235
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,459
and automating a lot of manual processes

236
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,240
like account creation can
make our lives easier.

237
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,970
We need things to provide context

238
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,130
around those vulnerabilities

239
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,870
we are seeing in a dashboard.

240
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,060
If an exploit path is present

241
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,530
or if there are active or
mature exploit in the wild,

242
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,780
for instance and we need
to know what the basis

243
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,030
of that context is

244
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,170
because what we see is often difficult

245
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,310
to discern relevance from,

246
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,280
and we end up relying more on
the automation to do our jobs

247
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,680
and the actual skills
that enable us to do them.

248
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,440
Here's an example to scare you.

249
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,800
They didn't fully understand
what was happening

250
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,020
amid a confusing cacophony
of warning alarms and alerts.

251
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,470
That could not regain control,

252
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,270
killing a total of 346 people.

253
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,180
This is an excerpt from NPR digging

254
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,329
into why two 737 Max airplanes crashed.

255
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,000
It turned out Boeing squad design

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,770
and a new automated flight control system

257
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,423
was a major contributing factor.

258
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,680
We can destroy lives

259
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,979
if we fail to take the time to understand.

260
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,890
Think about this.

261
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,830
Without having transparency
and how automation works

262
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,570
understanding what it is showing

263
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,730
and where things are coming from

264
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,270
we can destroy lives.

265
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,250
The more we automate without transparency

266
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,640
into how the automation works

267
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,600
and without taking the
time to understand it

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,470
we're losing valuable skills and knowledge

269
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,270
that may eventually be
catastrophic to another human being

270
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,740
or even the planet.

271
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,683
And as we've seen in the above case,

272
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,030
we need to pay attention
and we need to make changes.

273
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,360
But we cannot make changes
until we understand

274
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,343
how we got here.

275
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,220
Our technology history is
steeped in research and defense,

276
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,200
seeking to understand
and seeking to secure.

277
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,340
How have we moved so far from this?

278
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,380
We've lost our curiosity as a community

279
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,360
and the culture that it cultivated.

280
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,220
Individuals spend months
exploring the vast complexities

281
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,794
of revolutionary computers and networks,

282
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:06,050
learning how they operate, interact

283
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,839
and how they can be exploited.

284
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,210
Retaining, sharing and
publishing any details learned

285
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,780
enable collaboration and
breakthroughs only accomplished

286
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,730
by building on decades of knowledge.

287
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,490
This Corpus of knowledge,
a glacier, if you will

288
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,060
is the basis by which
modern technology upheavals

289
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,560
were born from.

290
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,699
The commoditization of innovation,

291
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,550
the building of more
complex higher order systems

292
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,500
significantly reduces the learning curve

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,440
to use each new capability

294
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,990
because we assume that the
knowledge gained to develop it

295
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,680
is imparted on the generation using it.

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,189
We also assume that it has
performed due diligence

297
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,820
for security, and lucky us

298
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,860
we get to inherit all of their hard work.

299
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,403
But unfortunately this
is not always the case.

300
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,490
In order to win world war II

301
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,720
we needed to increase the input

302
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
and processing of the
existing computers we had.

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,100
There were human at the time.

304
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,470
IBM's ASCC, otherwise known as the Mark I,

305
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,510
along with other
electromechanical computers

306
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,680
were designed to solve advanced

307
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,520
mathematical-physics problems
to support the war effort.

308
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,819
Soliciting knowledge
across multiple federal

309
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,760
and non-federal groups,

310
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,569
the US was able to modify
and improve upon the ideas

311
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,810
of the EDVAC, Mark I, and
eventually the UNIVAC.

312
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,314
The need to increase
speed and better tests

313
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,450
for inputting data into this equipment

314
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,040
led to the creation of the
A-0, A-1 and A-2 compilers,

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,430
which then led to the
concept of keyboard input

316
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,959
and then FORTRAN.

317
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
These are the major innovations

318
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,120
in a long line of innovations.

319
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,780
And for the purposes of
this talk, we'll start here.

320
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,540
What were the innovations
from the 40s and 50s?

321
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,550
The methodology of writing
code or software development

322
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,030
was a by-product of getting
more accurate results

323
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,300
from the Mark I.

324
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,060
The concept of reusable
memory was exercised.

325
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,599
We see programming test
being literally written

326
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,280
and then encoded to ensure the machines

327
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,689
are configured correctly.

328
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,460
And the concept of compiling code

329
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,050
to enable more efficient
use of the computer.

330
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,630
As we continue to build on the success

331
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,189
of electromechanical computers
and many other technologies

332
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,030
from that time, we are beginning
to see computing take hold

333
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,382
as a potential commodity.

334
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,780
Technologists in the 60s and 70s realized

335
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,310
we needed faster ways to communicate

336
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,719
with this new medium and thus began

337
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,080
the era of telecommunications.

338
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,740
ASCII, basic Unix, are
key innovations here

339
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,990
but continuing on that collaboration idea

340
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,270
ARPANET becomes the internet
and emails are now being sent.

341
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,490
Pong has officially made a state view.

342
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,350
Thanks to Apple I and Apple II

343
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,950
personal computing has potential.

344
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,350
And we see text-based RPGs
begin to make an entrance.

345
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,990
The innovations of the
60s and 70s were email.

346
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,350
The ability to send a message

347
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,200
and receive a response faster
than the postal service.

348
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,060
The internet or intranet connecting more

349
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,540
and more people every day.

350
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,339
The concept of computer gaming,

351
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,620
that computers can be used for
more than mere calculations

352
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,950
and can provide an entertainment value.

353
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,890
Microprocessors that enable computers

354
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,600
to do more than just one thing.

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,300
With telecommunications now being

356
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,219
a largely expected presence for the future

357
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,840
of any organization's success,

358
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,950
we are seeing network systems
become the next commodity

359
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,440
enabling technical play
and a rising counterculture

360
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,130
looking to poke and pry at these existing

361
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,723
wide open architectures
built on implicit trust.

362
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,830
With more people owning personal computers

363
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,810
and getting online or passing laser discs

364
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,050
and now CD ROMs with games on them around

365
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,120
curiosity is beginning to push people

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,100
to test the limits of this
new pagan and discover.

367
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,130
Using it in ways that the
creators had never thought.

368
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,580
Do you think that Grace Hopper

369
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,320
or the US Navy would have ever predicted

370
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,680
that Mark I's ability to
calculate trajectories

371
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,209
to support a war would contribute

372
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,810
to community focused on entertainment.

373
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,750
In the 1980s

374
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,830
the Morris worm began to
wreak havoc on the internet.

375
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,688
The first felony conviction
of the US happens

376
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:41,060
as a result underneath of the 1986

377
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,569
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

378
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,930
Industry and government are
beginning to pay attention

379
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,099
to the counterculture that
is growing in the internet

380
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,290
and freakers wreaking havoc

381
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,099
in these wide open insecure
telecommunication systems.

382
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,800
The innovations of the 80s

383
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,099
were better memory,
floppies CD-ROM, flash.

384
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,690
They all contributed to our
ability to continue refining

385
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,530
and making computers more powerful.

386
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,230
Word processing enabled more efficient

387
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,760
and consistent communication within

388
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,480
and across organizations.

389
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,320
C++ is created and
computer security awareness

390
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,690
finally appears in the
media for the first time.

391
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,110
Everyone is now getting online

392
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,840
and companies are seeing a new space,

393
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,440
e-commerce to increase
revenue and reach new markets

394
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,850
they didn't know existed.

395
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,820
A growing need for security
experts is becoming apparent.

396
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,883
The internet is now the commodity.

397
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,833
In a rush to tap into
e-commerce potential companies,

398
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,520
in a rush to tap into e-commerce

399
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,439
potential companies
began purchasing compute.

400
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,330
They bought space, they hired people.

401
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,500
They needed tons of admins and developers

402
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
to bring their brick and
mortar presence online.

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,960
And many of those individuals

404
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,890
came out of that counter-culture,

405
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,870
'cause they were the only
ones with the knowledge

406
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,630
of how these new systems and networks ran.

407
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,140
We can see skills like system
admin, network engineer

408
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,390
and server hardware technician

409
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,970
becomes some of the highest paying

410
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,860
and highest demand jobs in the
market alongside developers.

411
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,730
But we also see configuration drift

412
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,670
making its first appearance.

413
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,370
Companies needed the flexibility

414
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,970
to make their online presence possible.

415
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,270
And with that counterculture
of freakers and hackers

416
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,890
now becoming professionalized,

417
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,930
we begin to see more open-source use.

418
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,170
Innovations in the 90s, Linux,

419
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,640
arguably the most widespread

420
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,780
and most use open source project.

421
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,350
Web browsers enabling
internet access for companies

422
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,080
and consumers alike.

423
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,650
Wifi enables technologists
to move about free

424
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,959
from wires and still be online.

425
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,070
Online transactions,

426
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,850
getting paid electronically for
goods and services rendered.

427
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,283
And Java, still one of the
top languages in use today.

428
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,420
Companies are now beginning
to feel the pain of these

429
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,000
IT gains from the 90s,

430
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,070
some making the drastic jump
to create utility computing

431
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,460
seeing this as the next need by industry.

432
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,640
Automation and skills consolidation

433
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,050
that I talked about
earlier are happening now.

434
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,400
We begin to see the knowledge
loss and skills abandonment.

435
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,930
Organizations begin to shift

436
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,609
and offload their technical debt

437
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,490
in favor of outsourcing
homegrown unsustainable solutions

438
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,339
to companies arriving on scene

439
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,419
that can solve those problems for them

440
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,750
because of their specializations.

441
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,329
Teams focus more on doing one thing well,

442
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,829
really well, and selling
this as a service.

443
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,849
The beginnings of career
and product alignment

444
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,050
appears individuals begin to deep dive

445
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,879
on major problem areas.

446
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,470
Agile and DevOps make an
appearance and gain a following

447
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,310
as more and more companies
realize waterfall development

448
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,550
is not sustainable for
reacting to market changes.

449
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,919
Teams are relying heavily
on their most senior person.

450
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,220
As Ian Coldwater put it

451
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,150
recognized by the Epic
beard or fabulous hair

452
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,400
to come in and save the day

453
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,540
and then disappear on a
cloud of smoke and fire

454
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,970
when your metrics, if you had them,

455
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,020
started flashing green again.

456
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,900
What were the innovations?
Utility computing.

457
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,330
It only exists because of
the networking languages

458
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,169
and compute that came before it.

459
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,300
DevOps recognizing silo teams

460
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,980
cannot enable high velocity
product delivery in Agile

461
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,630
a better way to develop software.

462
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,070
And these are all great things.

463
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,750
We have done so much.

464
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,380
The world isn't on fire.

465
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,080
It probably is, but that's
not the point of this talk.

466
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,783
Consider this.

467
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:13,800
And in order to work
on the UNIVAC I in 1951

468
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,909
you had to have an advanced
mathematics background

469
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,720
and experience in a very exclusive field.

470
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,941
Today, you do not need
to know the fundamentals

471
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,320
of networking to create
an e-commerce site in AWS

472
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,439
or even be strong in
any programming language

473
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,980
and not even know a programming language.

474
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,353
We've made it this easy,
but what's the cost?

475
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
In the past and even today,

476
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,340
highly specialized capabilities
require in-depth knowledge

477
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,649
to fundamentally understand how they work.

478
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,040
This specialized knowledge generally means

479
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,780
there was a lack of focus on security,

480
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,750
the configurations of these capabilities,

481
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,620
where to optimize them to do the one thing

482
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,120
that they were designed to do.

483
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,810
Attacks in this area therefore required

484
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,340
equal knowledge specialization

485
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,750
in order to successfully carry them out.

486
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,650
Usually this meant time to learn

487
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,830
and understand how the object works.

488
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,895
More commonly today is this generalization

489
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,700
inter compatibility of components.

490
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,110
This lowers the barrier to entry

491
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,240
because technologists
don't require their users

492
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
to understand fundamental concepts

493
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,720
of how software systems work.

494
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,810
They can get started and deploy easily.

495
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,330
This means the default
settings are insecure

496
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,280
as security often delays
lead time to deploy,

497
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,610
ironically because it's
not the default behavior.

498
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,310
And would require the user
probably to understand

499
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,580
not only how the product
they want to use works

500
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,330
but also how the remaining
parts of the architecture work.

501
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,220
And let's be honest, no
one has time for that.

502
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,020
Because we've made it so
easy for people to use,

503
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,810
that means that there are
more instances of insecure

504
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,389
by default, which means
an attacker just needs

505
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,160
to exploit one area to be able

506
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,370
to impact hundreds or thousands.

507
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,699
So while the complexity
of the attack is gone

508
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,880
we've now increased the volume

509
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,390
and spread of the potential attack.

510
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,480
Nothing is really more secure here.

511
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,790
Effectively, you have to choose

512
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,010
between making it incredibly hard

513
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,650
and unappealing for the attacker

514
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,490
because you have to know the ins and outs

515
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,650
of how everything you have works

516
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,930
and therefore have to commit
more time to exploiting you.

517
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,590
Or you end up biting the bullet

518
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,899
and just know that you're
going to get your product owned

519
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,060
in some capacity, but you did your best

520
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,389
by at least making security

521
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,840
an option in the configurations
for your product.

522
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,670
So let's talk about SCADA
and infrastructure systems.

523
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,210
Organizations and governments
are looking for any

524
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,690
and every way to use
their job and save money.

525
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,710
If they can make it easier to do X

526
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,510
then I can focus more on Y.

527
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,580
Or if I can save X because we can outscore

528
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,060
our security requirements

529
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,659
then I can apply that
to Y for next quarter.

530
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,000
We see this through the adoption

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,580
of smart grid technology,
remote access enabling

532
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,100
on workstations and the
continued interconnectivity

533
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,709
between consumers and suppliers.

534
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,860
This means we've taken
the security headaches

535
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,639
of prehistoric technology
and modern technology

536
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
like a packet patching
poor access control,

537
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,130
credential compromise
is still very popular,

538
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,790
all of those things and applied it

539
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,300
to the lifeblood of humanity,
food, water, and shelter.

540
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,680
And when you talk about SCADA,

541
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,470
specifically only 10 to 20% of
organizations install patches

542
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,810
that the SCADA vendors are releasing

543
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,659
because of power cycle or shutdown

544
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,170
is required to apply them.

545
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,190
And nobody wants to be at fault

546
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,370
first service interruption.

547
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,560
By introducing more levels of automation,

548
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,495
new generations of
operators, won't be aware

549
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:26,060
of how to perform a manual override.

550
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,450
This lack of knowledge that
we discussed previously

551
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,640
and understanding how
the information system

552
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,640
is supposed to work and how
it's supposed to protect them

553
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,570
is a cybersecurity risk.

554
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,149
This goes the same for operators.

555
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,760
If operators fail to
understand how the automation

556
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,830
is interacting with their components

557
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,040
it's going to be a matter of
when not if an attack occurs

558
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,983
can they limit the damage?

559
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,830
In 2015 after six hours and a
loss of over 130 megawatt load

560
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,200
operators restored power
by sending technicians

561
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,742
to substations and manually
controlling the power system

562
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:02,980
because they knew how.

563
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,030
They pulled all the SCADA systems offline

564
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,630
which was the only way that
they could restore power.

565
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,140
The lack of complete knowledge

566
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,310
from the automation systems required

567
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,270
the Kyivoblenergo to
rely on their call center

568
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,460
which was subject to a
telephone denial of service

569
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,924
giving them untrustworthy information

570
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,190
to pinpoint and respond to outages.

571
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,290
And since the HMI was
offline, the backup system

572
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,040
which was their telephones
was enabled to assist them

573
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,562
in bringing power back.

574
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,530
More recently attackers
successfully manipulated

575
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,580
the levels of sodium hydroxide or lye

576
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,020
in Oldsmar, Florida water treatment plant.

577
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,950
The engineer initially dismissed it

578
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,060
because his boss often connected

579
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,690
to the engineer's workstation

580
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,090
to monitor the facility system.

581
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,570
If you're not cringing at this point

582
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,850
you probably should be.

583
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,709
The engineer had been trained
to normalize remote access

584
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,690
from an unknown entity.

585
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,660
Five and a half hours later
the cursor began clicking

586
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,520
through the water
treatment plants controls

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,150
again, considered normal
behavior by the boss

588
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,390
until the attacker changed
the level of lye and was seen.

589
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,070
What if the attacker also happened

590
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,750
to override the automated
pH testing safeguards

591
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,830
with false data,

592
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,470
similar to prerecording
security footage to play

593
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,070
while you pull off a heist.

594
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,639
Would the engineer have been
able to detect the override?

595
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,090
No. It happened.

596
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,030
Even able to revert the changes,

597
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,330
had they not been in
front of the workstation?

598
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,140
We are relying a lot on the
tools we use to work properly.

599
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,310
We make assumptions and
provide implicit trust

600
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,690
on what was sold to us.

601
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,523
When they break.

602
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:38,740
There are very few individuals
who know how things worked

603
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,640
before those tools were integrated

604
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,280
or why we choose those tools.

605
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,580
And a lot of them are nearing retirement.

606
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,730
In less 30 years we will have lost

607
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,020
most of the generation
that gave us Netflix,

608
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,290
Berry code and Back Orifice.

609
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,800
This is where we are at.

610
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,710
We've got developers cranking out code

611
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,490
using build kits and pipelines
to make their lives easier

612
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,230
so that they can deploy
their ideas to production.

613
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,740
But do they know how to verify

614
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,320
or even reproduce their builds

615
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,889
to detect malicious
insertions such as occurred

616
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,600
with solar winds?

617
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,719
We've got admins and
operators cranking out

618
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,130
those same scripts and watching

619
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,330
the beautiful colorful
charts for monitoring

620
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,840
all of their services, reporting
green with no error codes.

621
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,679
How many of them know what those metrics

622
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,940
are actually looking at

623
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,570
to determine green, yellow, red, or death?

624
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,000
Or independently verified that
they aren't being falsified

625
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,070
or what that script they
copied from stack overflow

626
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,740
actually does, where
that dependency came from

627
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,993
and what else is in it.

628
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,540
This is a struggle.

629
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,030
Balancing velocity with
knowledge to overcome risk.

630
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,600
The epitome of security is knowing

631
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,689
as much as you can about what you have

632
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,050
what you will have, what you don't have

633
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,240
so you can implement a
balance of security controls

634
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,890
and compensating mechanisms
to ensure your data

635
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,330
or your customer's data

636
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,110
isn't plastered all over
tomorrow's news headline.

637
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,399
Take the supply chain,

638
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,850
do you know where that
library actually came from?

639
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,199
Are you sure you spelled
the package name correctly?

640
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,050
Is that really your build
running in production.

641
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,580
In the age of Kubernetes
and folks getting fancy

642
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,810
with their names, it makes
it easy for your team

643
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,330
to be owned and a typo squat.

644
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,360
We cannot expect developers and operators

645
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,379
to know everything there
is to know about security.

646
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,030
We can't send them back to college

647
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,060
for another security degree.

648
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,690
We only have so much room

649
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,670
and our own personal knowledge base.

650
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,730
Something has to go.

651
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,610
And for most of the technical community,

652
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,639
if it's not something
that they do every day

653
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,320
or even every week, it gets lost.

654
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,149
That glacier starts to melt.

655
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,360
It becomes knowledge icebergs.

656
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,469
Developers don't secure applications.

657
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,960
They build and ship them.

658
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,410
That's what they do.

659
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,930
So how do we enable ourselves to innovate

660
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,210
build on the knowledge of others

661
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,120
in an informed and transparent way?

662
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,620
How do we ensure the security

663
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,320
of what it is that we're building?

664
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,750
As institutional knowledge disappears

665
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,650
these glaciers melt and break off.

666
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,300
They form knowledge icebergs.

667
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,840
Layers of obstruction in
our information systems

668
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,490
and architectures are designed
to create defense and depth

669
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,300
and security barriers as well
as enable developer teams

670
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,260
to focus on what they specialize in

671
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,440
creating new products and services.

672
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,970
If we were to apply
water density principles

673
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,600
how icebergs float here,

674
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,340
about 10% of knowledge
needed to create or innovate

675
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,159
is institutional or deep
technical knowledge.

676
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,690
When used in this capacity
it is considered passive.

677
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,170
Understanding how it works,
seeing beyond the horizon.

678
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,970
90% of the knowledge used

679
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,800
is in daily tasking and
implementation details.

680
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,899
When used in this capacity, it's active.

681
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,890
This is the practice of
commoditizing a thing

682
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,580
and working through that
on a day-to-day basis.

683
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,129
But when a crisis occurs
such as a cyber attack,

684
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,520
those values flip.

685
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,970
Our active knowledge must become 100%

686
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,000
to inhibit or revert an attack.

687
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,450
We have to understand how
the system actually works

688
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,530
as well as how we think it works,

689
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,560
which is usually a result of
abstraction and automation

690
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,129
in order to estimate what else

691
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,630
could have been tampered with.

692
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,240
If you fell asleep and are completely lost

693
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,970
about how to save the knowledge
glaciers, don't worry.

694
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,803
I've got you.

695
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,860
Nurture the people to have
to expand their skills.

696
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,909
Do not abandon them.

697
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,610
You need them, whether
you realize it now or not.

698
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,439
They provide a unique
experience and can diversify

699
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,360
your way of thinking
as well as provide you

700
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,709
with the information you need

701
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,140
to make better security decisions.

702
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,340
Encourage your teams to learn together.

703
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,389
No one individual can be responsible

704
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,270
for successfully relaying
institutional knowledge.

705
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,020
Not everyone is a born educator

706
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,250
and some people don't like talking.

707
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,410
That's okay.

708
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,210
Give them opportunities that suit them

709
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,123
to collaborate and shine.

710
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,990
Documentation is important,

711
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,664
but making documentation
accessible is the most important.

712
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,210
Easy to understand is the second.

713
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,270
We cannot save knowledge
if we cannot find it

714
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,590
or even understand it.

715
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,070
This means making it available
in multiple languages

716
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,189
and in multiple different avenues.

717
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,420
If someone took the time to write it down

718
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,760
it needs to be read.

719
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,110
Make the time to read and
encourage others to do the same.

720
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,100
Find the balance between
velocity and knowledge.

721
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,173
And we can save the knowledge glaciers.

722
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,250
You need to engage in systems thinking.

723
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,060
Understand it and to
end as much as you can

724
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,879
and don't be afraid to ask questions

725
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,280
because inevitably the amount
of time it will take you

726
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,690
to discover the information
needed to resolve a crisis

727
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,740
is more panic and stress inducing

728
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,250
than if you had just had
it in the first place.

729
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,860
This is what makes teams employing

730
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,750
chaos engineering so successful.

731
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,460
And if the documentation
sucks, submit an issue

732
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,790
and take the time to be specific

733
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,250
and provide a recommendation if you can.

734
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,730
The extra five or 10 minutes
you spend explaining it

735
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,710
as a security professional
or as a developer

736
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,500
or a system admin will
save somebody else an hour

737
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,290
of trying to understand what it is

738
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,670
you're attempting to explain.

739
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,910
We need to promote and cultivate a culture

740
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,790
of continual learning and experimentation.

741
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,210
We've lost it and need it back

742
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,220
if we want to continue to
innovate in a secure fashion.

743
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,860
We need to accept the
challenges that come with this

744
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,490
and enable changes to
make it safe to fail fast

745
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,193
and stop normalizing bad behaviors.

746
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,440
I've talked a lot about a bunch
of different topics today.

747
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,300
I have references available
to you on this slide.

748
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,209
If you're interested in learning more

749
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,400
reconfirming any of the
information that I have presented.

750
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,850
I cannot take the time to stress enough.

751
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,000
Understanding how these things work

752
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,790
and sharing that institutional knowledge

753
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,310
is key to a successful and
healthy security organization

754
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,280
and security culture.

755
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,353
Thank you so much for your time today.
