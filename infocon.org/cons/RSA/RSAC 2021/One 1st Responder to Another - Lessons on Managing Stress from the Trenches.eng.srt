1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,003
- Hi everybody.

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,770
My name is Ed Vasko, I'm the director

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,410
for the Institute for
Pervasive Cybersecurity

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,740
at Boise State University.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,370
And with me today is Carol Barkes.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,610
Carol?

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,851
- Hi!

8
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,870
(Edward chuckles)

9
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,379
- We're gonna be talking about today,

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,979
first responders and the
impact of first responder

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,450
toxic stress on the
cyber security community

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,780
and on employees within
your particular programs

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,880
and trying to provide some
understanding and awareness

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,750
of why and how these toxic
triggers are occurring.

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,830
And how you can prevent them

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,620
and some ideas to take back to your teams

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,470
and reduce the stress for your teams.

18
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,859
The agenda very, very quickly.

19
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,750
I'm gonna set the stage

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,550
and I spend a little bit
of time giving everybody

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,849
some perspective on kind of the thesis

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,840
and the why we're here
and why I reached out

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,000
to Carol to include a subject
matter expert of her quality

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,875
and caliber with us here
to this conversation.

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,650
And really we're gonna spend
a significant portion of time

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,679
talking about toxic stress triggers,

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,030
how to determine them that
they're happening in your teams?

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,780
How to alleviate them?

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,060
And ultimately, trying to give some ideas

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,760
and tips and tricks to
take back to your team

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,343
and reduce that toxic stress.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,650
As I was thinking about the opportunity

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,750
to present here at RSA,
I came up on a thesis

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,270
that I think will resonate
with the audience.

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,530
And it all begins with the
adage that our industry

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,460
is built upon, which is that
the programs that we develop,

37
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,809
the teams that we pulled together,

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,310
and ultimately the work that we do

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,290
to reduce risk and eliminate
where we can that risk

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,840
for critical data and critical
infrastructure requires us

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,410
to have a perspective that
we have to be at right,

42
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,340
100% of the time

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,320
but the bad guys have to be wrong.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,660
I mean, have to be right only
1% of the time, one time.

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,850
We have to be right a 100% of that time.

46
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,329
And in doing that, that
creates an environment

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,810
and creates a level of
stress within leadership

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,600
and within the teams that we build.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,519
Whereby, we almost appear as though,

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,700
and should be looked upon as though

51
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,170
we were cyber first responders.

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,160
So the moment of clarity
for me was the idea

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,250
that the teams that we're building

54
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,300
and the people that we're
hiring are not dissimilar

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,300
to police, fire EMT and
other people who are involved

56
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,450
in day-in, day-out life saving
and law enforcement activity.

57
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,878
That stress of the environment
and the stress of being

58
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,560
having to be right a 100%
of the time is a situation

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,180
that can create an
environment where stress

60
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,810
and toxicity can leak
their way into your teams,

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,680
into individuals, and
ultimately create an environment

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,843
where people feel as though the work,

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,230
the company and the team

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,470
need to be removed from their environment

65
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,020
or they need to remove
themselves from the environment.

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,800
And so they ultimately decide to leave

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,080
and move on to another role,
in another organization.

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,070
And I've seen this time
and time again in working

69
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,572
with many, many organizations
around the country.

70
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,180
The turnover that we have within the teams

71
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,850
that we built up, the
turnover that we have

72
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,480
from a leadership standpoint

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,910
where as a chief
information security officer

74
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,109
the overall time that we
have in seat typically ranges

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,410
between 18 months to 24 months

76
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,240
and then we move on to
another organization.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,370
Our teams that we build are also seen

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,600
and going through that
same kind of stress,

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,489
and as a result of that are departing

80
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,680
and going somewhere else.

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,630
In doing so, not necessarily alleviating

82
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,630
the necessary stress and toxicity
that they may be receiving

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,080
from the environment and
the need to always be on,

84
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,330
and always be available,
and always be right.

85
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,600
So what I wanted to do,
well, in this particular talk

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,250
was talk a little bit about
some of the financial impacts,

87
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,600
what we're actually
dealing with as it relates

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,790
to this need for turnover of staff.

89
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,280
And then also most importantly,
really hone the message

90
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,000
and talk about ways that we as leaders

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,780
can reduce overall
stress within our teams,

92
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,090
and reduce overall stress
within ourselves, even.

93
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,049
And in doing that,
perhaps alleviate the need

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,480
to look for a new job,
look for a new role,

95
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,810
and move on from one
organization to another.

96
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,070
These are little things I can't guarantee

97
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,280
that they're gonna fix
everything but these little steps

98
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,140
hopefully will provide you
an opportunity to see things

99
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,740
in a better light, to
apply them to your team,

100
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,070
and keep your team members well within

101
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,743
your organization for a while longer.

102
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,320
Ultimately, what we're
really talking about here

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,659
is just the overarching
stress of being overworked

104
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,880
and the overall problem that we

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,760
as cyber security first responders face.

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,627
Again, that old adage being
right a 100% of the time,

107
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,630
but the bad guys have to be right once

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,610
is this constant looming
threat that we have

109
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,100
and constant looming stress
that we have within our lives.

110
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,350
And that stress can lead
to physical ailments,

111
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,650
it can lead to mental ailments.

112
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,239
And ultimately, that's
where Carol's gonna come-in

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,990
in just a few minutes and
talk very specifically around

114
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,690
some of the key actions and
key things we can be doing

115
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,143
to improve ourselves
and improve our teams.

116
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,620
I do wanted sidebar very
quickly on the actual cost

117
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,480
of this attraction and
retention loop that we find

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,040
ourselves in oftentimes,
and in doing so provide some

119
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,300
perspective on why this
kind of conversation

120
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,970
is so important to us as an industry.

121
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,020
And as leaders in this industry

122
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,700
we need to be aware of the need

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,409
for finding opportunities
to reduce our own stress

124
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,183
and reduce our team stress.

125
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,980
And it all comes back to
in some form of passion

126
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,730
it comes back to attracting
and retaining a great staff,

127
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,730
and enabling that staff with
ways to reduce that stress

128
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,409
and reduce their perspective
that they are always on,

129
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,743
and in a first responder
mode at all times.

130
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,130
Here's an example of the process
that I've tried to lay out

131
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,110
using the numbers from the prior slide

132
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,110
where an analyst in my
hometown of Boise, Idaho

133
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,603
cost about $60,000 on average for a hire.

134
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,060
Typically, the recruiting
fees that I've seen

135
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,510
in the industry right
now, because of the supply

136
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,289
and demand imbalance can range
upwards of 50% for a role.

137
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,160
But I went ahead and took
a conservative number

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,330
and said, "25% of the base salary

139
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,407
should be tacked on for recruiting fees."

140
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,900
As leaders, we find
ourselves having to negotiate

141
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,590
all too often, additional
training commitments

142
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,760
and additional package
elements for new hires.

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,810
And so I went ahead in this particular

144
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,040
kind of back of the envelope analysis

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,080
and add-in an additional
$5,000 for training

146
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,303
on an annual basis for this new hire.

147
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,710
Having built very significant
number of programs through

148
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,650
my career, what I've seen
is new hire's typically

149
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,010
take on average about four
months to go through the process

150
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,500
of coming on board and actually
activating and providing

151
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,703
results and providing value
to you and your organization.

152
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,140
And so I attribute that to lost time.

153
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,419
So I add that additional time back on

154
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,963
into this overall equation.

155
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:28,500
Noving through this, we
typically see on average

156
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,130
about 18 months, 24 months that
most is the top end of most

157
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,030
of the statistics that we see
in terms of turnover of staff.

158
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,262
So I've chose 18 months in the role.

159
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,570
Inevitably, that 18
month time over 14 months

160
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,950
really, when you think about
the activation timeframe,

161
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,120
14 months of value is what
your organization's receiving.

162
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,680
But once that person leaves
ultimately you then have

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,760
a four month timeframe
on average of recruiting

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,380
where you've got this lost
is open gap within your team.

165
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,320
Most of us choose to
go a contracting route

166
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,420
or we look for an alternative workforce.

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,329
We try to find some way to fill that gap

168
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,260
as quickly as we can because we know

169
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,920
how stretched in our teams already are

170
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,839
and anybody leaving stretches
the team even further.

171
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,150
So we typically hire in a contractor

172
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,040
went ahead and put in some
average contractor time

173
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,593
and contractor dollars into
the overall equation here.

174
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Ultimately, through that time
effort you find somebody new

175
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,670
go through the recruiting process

176
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,740
and you go through the negotiating process

177
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,180
'cause the timeframe that
we're now suddenly under

178
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,113
we find ourselves having to pay more.

179
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,120
Guess what? The process
starts all over again.

180
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,630
And as a result of that,
we end up with this cost

181
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,030
of this entire cycle this ever
increasing costs of the cycle

182
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,140
which just adds as leaders
to our overall stress

183
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,850
of having to attract and
retain and constantly move

184
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,810
through this loop of
attraction and retention

185
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,160
and replacement of staff.

186
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,870
And so I felt that really
important for us to sit down

187
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,627
and have a conversation to say,

188
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,270
"What sort of tools can we provide?

189
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,610
What sort of tools do we need
to look to use as leaders?"

190
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,040
And the opportunity arose
to engage Carol Barkes

191
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,693
into this conversation, and
I wanna bring her in to this.

192
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,010
She is really a wonderful
subject matter expert.

193
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,510
I'm gonna let her introduce herself

194
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,060
and take some time to
give you her background.

195
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,560
But the goal here is to think about ways

196
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,369
and have her present ways
that we as leaders can reduce

197
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,560
our stress, reduce our team stress,

198
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,650
and we can identify the types of triggers

199
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,650
that maybe able to help you
retain those staff members

200
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,860
longer than that 18 to 24 month timeframe.

201
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,860
And in doing so increase your
overall teamwork, team value,

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,370
and provide better risk
reduction to your organization.

203
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,430
Carol, if you could take us a few minutes

204
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,040
and introduce yourself, please.

205
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,079
- Yeah. Thanks, Ed.

206
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,840
I did exactly growing up, I
thought when I was a kiddo

207
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,170
that I would become an anthropologist

208
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,130
or an archeologist or
maybe a paleontologist

209
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,010
but instead I went on to go
to college for marine biology.

210
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,500
And when I did that, I did
exactly what you would expect

211
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,032
I would do when I got out of
school, I went into banking.

212
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:33,340
From there, I became one of
the first female firefighters

213
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,650
in Redwood City, California

214
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,959
which is just South of San Francisco.

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,020
Then went on to run a
manufacturing company

216
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,300
and become an entrepreneur

217
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,130
and then went through a
pretty horrific divorce,

218
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,939
not that any of them are good.

219
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,147
And then had to start all over again,

220
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,610
and this time I went back to school

221
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,840
for a master's in conflict
resolution and negotiation,

222
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,800
really thinking that maybe
it would just help me

223
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,370
with the divorce fighting.

224
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,260
But along that line, I got
acquainted with neuroscience

225
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,330
and I found this sweet
spot that had not been

226
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,797
addressed before with conflict and stress

227
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,770
and the brain and neuroscience.

228
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,140
And I've found that
helping people understand

229
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,410
what's going on under the
hood can be this amazing thing

230
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,410
that helps make big changes
with really simple processes.

231
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,410
So it's a really great
way to put hard science

232
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,520
to some of the things that
feel a little soft and squishy

233
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
but that are the game
changers in what you do.

234
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,300
So I'm thrilled to be
able to join Ed today

235
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,120
and talk about this.

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,510
- Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Carol.

237
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,983
I really do appreciate you taking the time

238
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:40,073
and I think we're gonna have
a really great conversation.

239
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,040
Well, the first things
I wanted to kind of ask

240
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,400
is we've kinda laid the groundwork where

241
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,730
our cyber teams are first responders

242
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,010
and if there's a very
deep similarity between

243
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,970
emergency service first responders

244
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,860
and the cyber security field?

245
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,453
That there's a lot of
similarity to the toxic stress

246
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:06,459
and the toxic triggers that we see

247
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,520
in both of those communities.

248
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm wondering if you could take some time

249
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,590
to kinda share and explain
that for us a little bit.

250
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,080
- Indeed. And this was maybe one

251
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,520
of the most exciting
things that we talked about

252
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,160
when you and I were putting
this project together,

253
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
which was there is such a similarity.

254
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,589
And I remember being a firefighter

255
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,610
and when there was a big
fire that didn't go right

256
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,850
or maybe it could be structured,
it could be wild land

257
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,470
but typically what would
happen is somebody's job

258
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,610
would be on the line
because of the politicians

259
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,590
or whoever the community
leaders were needed to be able

260
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,290
to say, "We are making
this better next time."

261
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,120
And unfortunately, that
making it better as often

262
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,440
at the expense of somebody who
has been working really hard

263
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,940
to try and make things better
for their organization.

264
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,440
And we saw this just recently
when there was the attack

265
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,080
on the Capitol and the chief of police

266
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,830
for the US Capitol Police Department.

267
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,510
And then two of the other

268
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,360
senior security officials had to resign.

269
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,300
And Nancy Pelosi at that point
said, "Heads are gonna roll."

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,469
And somebody's going to
pay for what happened

271
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,850
because that is the nature
of our culture, right?

272
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,303
That somebody has to pay.

273
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:20,069
So when 60 minutes rolled around

274
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,397
when you and I were talking about this,

275
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:23,610
and then Steven's son to the chief

276
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,500
or the Capitol police was talking

277
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,690
and he said with all
sincerity, "That he really knew

278
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,300
that there would be some sort of protest,

279
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
but he never in a million years thought

280
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,079
that it would become violent."

281
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,350
And if you think about it,
our brains typically look at

282
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,580
current events and go on past events.

283
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,220
So we look for patterns.

284
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,010
And so we've never had an
attack on the Capitol like this.

285
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,880
So it's not unreasonable
that he wouldn't think

286
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,290
to that degree, but yet he needed to have

287
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,650
a step down position, which
was you either step down

288
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,420
or you get fired which is very similar

289
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,151
to what you're going through
right now with Cybersecurity.

290
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:07,760
And the toll on your field
is just insane right now

291
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,740
because as we switched to virtual

292
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,563
it's just a bigger deal than ever.

293
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,533
- Yeah. Very much so, very much so.

294
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,770
And I think one of the
things that thinking about

295
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,090
those types of toxic stressors,

296
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,100
the types of things and
types of environments

297
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,000
and situations that you find yourself.

298
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,270
What type of situational
elements are we seeing today

299
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,270
in this kind of post-COVID world
as we've moved to a remote?

300
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,290
As there's been a significant amount

301
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,447
of effort to isolate ourselves,

302
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,870
I'm curious as to what you could share

303
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,330
one of those kinds of
situational stressors

304
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,490
that we're seeing today?

305
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,800
- Yeah. It's really interesting.

306
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,487
Every year, Gallup does
a poll that's called,

307
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:59,780
"Stress in America," and
it's done on an annual basis.

308
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,430
And it has been really
interesting to watch every year

309
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,839
but with the COVID, they've
now increased it to every

310
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,770
quarter they do an update on it.

311
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,970
And what they've found in
their most recent polls

312
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,430
is that the mental health
in the United States

313
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,757
is the worst than it's been
in 20 years, in two decades.

314
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:17,589
It's a big, big deal.

315
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,520
And you would see this
even more in your field

316
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,930
because of all the added stress
we were just talking about.

317
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,839
And so what really is happening
is that we're isolated

318
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
from people more than
we've ever been before.

319
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,940
And our brains are really,
even though we might think

320
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,360
that we like to be alone, our
brains have a huge component

321
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,700
that is around being social.

322
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,470
That was how we survived to
be alive as a team right now.

323
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,700
And then we also don't have the ability

324
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,510
to forecast everything that's happening

325
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,790
because we've never had
this experience before.

326
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,319
So the change component
and the fear of the unknown

327
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,620
always create this magical storm.

328
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,380
So whenever we can not
connect all the dots

329
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,000
our brains go to this negative place.

330
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,750
And so you're seeing a lot

331
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,260
of that going on and then distractions.

332
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,859
So you may have gone

333
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,419
from working at your
office to working at home.

334
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,000
And so now for me, like out
of the side peripheral vision

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,740
I see all my neighbors
go riding their bikes,

336
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,040
and walking their dogs.

337
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,629
And I go, "Oh, I want to be out there,"

338
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,500
and then I go, "Wait, wait, wait.

339
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,810
I'm supposed to be doing something,"

340
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,421
and some of us have kids at home.

341
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,069
And so all of those things
make it harder to think

342
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,360
and work when you already have stress.

343
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,689
And in fact, every time
you get distracted,

344
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,840
they say, "It takes 20
extra minutes to get

345
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,350
your brain back on board."

346
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,429
So those are just some of those
things that are happening.

347
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,640
- That's yeah, that's very, very helpful.

348
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,510
Especially, in light of
many of the, as I mentioned,

349
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,010
the kind of always on approach

350
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,080
that cyber security
professionals have to have any

351
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,937
of those kind of external, you know,

352
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,530
environmental items that
pop on up yet, as you said,

353
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,930
people walking by the window
just the stress of knowing

354
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,380
that you have children in the house

355
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,864
or your spouses in the other room

356
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,160
and you're both trying
to have conversations.

357
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,360
I know from my own perspective
as we've at Boise State,

358
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,030
as we finally began to open
up offices and so forth,

359
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,790
I immediately jumped out of the house

360
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,670
to an office because
that's my normal modality

361
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,300
is to work in an office space.

362
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,322
So now that's I can definitely see that.

363
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,723
I'm curious, kind of moving
on to the next question,

364
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,260
as a researcher, as a
neuroscience researcher,

365
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,090
what sort of elements can
you give us some perspective?

366
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,110
'Cause I know that there's
stress is obviously impactful

367
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,387
not just from a fatiguing perspective

368
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:51,120
and from just a mental perspective.

369
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,850
But I mean, as I understand
things from what you've shown me

370
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,419
is that there's actual physical impact on

371
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,223
of stress on our bodies.

372
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:02,880
And I didn't know if you
wanted to want me to share

373
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,390
or you want to talk ahead of that

374
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,810
or if you want me to share the
video that you'd presented,

375
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,858
it was just an amazing thing.

376
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:09,929
You want to maybe talk us through that?

377
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,350
- Sure. Let me set that video
up just this minute for you

378
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,590
before we actually hit the play button.

379
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,810
But there are more than 50
signs and symptoms of stress.

380
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,480
So how stress impacts
you might be different

381
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
than how it impacts me.

382
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,367
But one of the things that we know

383
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,070
is that's the biggest
predictor of health issues

384
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,929
and the biggest cost to our country.

385
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,230
It's more than $30 billion worth of costs

386
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,640
to organizations and to our
economy in the United States.

387
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,764
So that's a big, big deal in there.

388
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,209
And there's a couple of
different things that I think

389
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,020
are probably important to
point out is that toxic stress

390
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,850
and stress have a really fine line.

391
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,330
So without any kind of
stress we're not motivated

392
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,399
to do anything, so stress by
itself isn't inherently bad.

393
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,864
And what might be toxic to you, Ed

394
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,370
might be okay to me
because it might drive me.

395
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,851
So it's important that we
don't put a blanket definition

396
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,700
on toxic stress but it's really
where you hit that threshold

397
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,080
where too much is too much.

398
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
And the problem with stress
is it can be my own stress

399
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,599
or it could be your stress.

400
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,320
So if you and I are working
together all the time

401
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,840
and you have toxic stress,
it can sip over into my brain

402
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,100
and cause toxic stress
just by association.

403
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,070
Which is why it's really
important that we take the pulse

404
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,669
on our whole team not just
on a person in our team.

405
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,760
And the slide that
you're just going to hit

406
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,140
the play button on, it
will show you a neuron.

407
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,010
So about middle up there
is a neuron that'll show

408
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,050
and yep, right where you're pointing.

409
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,960
And what happens is when
we have too much stress

410
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,880
we actually kill off neurons

411
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,380
and all the associated information.

412
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,340
And I find it very effective
to share with people

413
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,730
because it's very real and we need all

414
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,340
the information that's in our nog.

415
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,300
And especially, when you are having

416
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,450
an intellectual warfare with people.

417
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,203
So go ahead and show 'em, Ed.

418
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,820
- I'm trying to, I think we're...

419
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,320
Murphy might bite us on this one

420
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,790
for some reason I don't know what-

421
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,800
- Maybe, he didn't enable content.

422
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,871
- Yeah. It may not have been.

423
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:15,705
- Okay. So I can talk-
- So it's okay.

424
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,820
- through what that would look like.

425
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,409
So people get that long
strand on the kinda the right

426
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,740
of where your little finger is.

427
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,780
Those are neurons that are connected

428
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,690
and where you have been pointing

429
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,320
had been a neuron and it pops.

430
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,330
If you could imagine how a balloon pops?

431
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,379
And it's gone, all that
information's gone.

432
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,490
So this video just loops a couple of times

433
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,810
and it's just a matter of seconds.

434
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,960
So you really haven't lost two too much.

435
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,760
But the point is that you
make irrefutable damage

436
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,423
to your brain when you don't
manage your team's stress.

437
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,760
- No, thank you. Yeah.

438
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:58,817
So you know it stress can be
physically damaging to us.

439
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,990
It can certainly, as you
said, I mean the idea

440
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,640
that stress is a good thing.

441
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,030
We have to recognize the fact

442
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,290
that stress is a good
thing within our teams

443
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,639
but there's a point at
which stress can be toxic.

444
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,790
And recognizing how
certain team members deal

445
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,960
with stress and what
their stress levels are.

446
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,450
Are key elements to ensuring
that we're not creating

447
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:25,930
a toxic stress environments

448
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,370
for some team members,
but enabling others.

449
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,370
I think it's one of the key
things that you were saying

450
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,159
there before is that there's
this fine line that we

451
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,060
as leaders have to realize
that some of our team members

452
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,409
might thrive on a high level of stress.

453
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,990
Whereas, others may find themselves

454
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,460
in a very toxic situation
where they doing themselves

455
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,870
and the rest of the team a lot of harm

456
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,550
because of the fact that
they're associating with,

457
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,970
or dealing with, or working
with in a close way.

458
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,360
Those people who find themselves

459
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,459
in a much higher level of stress

460
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,010
or willing to accept a much
higher level of stress.

461
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,100
What are some of the key
tips that we can be using

462
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,100
to identify when our brains
are reaching that point?

463
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,910
How we can enable our team members to know

464
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,980
that they're reaching that point?

465
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,490
So that we can start to
enable ourselves to back off

466
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,016
and also enable our team
members more importantly,

467
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:27,810
to be able to find themselves
in a different spot

468
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,590
and being able to come back
into what would probably

469
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,300
be an acceptable stress range.

470
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,830
- Sure. And this is
such a hard thing to say

471
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,740
because the fixes are easy.

472
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,367
And yet when I say 'em
typically people will say,

473
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,010
"I can't do that. We have too
much going on to do that."

474
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,400
So knowing that the
audience is gonna think that

475
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,130
I'm just asking you to suspend
that automatic response

476
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,480
and hear me because the very first thing

477
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,120
is to actually slow down a little bit.

478
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,770
So when we're barreling through the day

479
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:02,200
trying to put holes in
all the leaking spots

480
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,880
where the water is coming out,

481
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,020
what happens is our brain
doesn't really get a chance

482
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,240
to tap in to our genius thinking that

483
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,080
largely happens underneath the hood.

484
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,080
So our brain's generally
are fought to have 98 to 99%

485
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,370
of our reasoning is done under the hood.

486
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,989
And so only 1 to 2% is
actually conscious to us.

487
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,930
So if we don't slow down, we don't notice.

488
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,840
So we won't notice what's
happening to our peers.

489
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,889
We won't necessarily even stop to think

490
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,270
what's happening to us.

491
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,270
And so we will blow right past
obvious and easy solutions.

492
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,020
And one of the tools that I love the most,

493
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,670
maybe I like it because
when I was a firefighter

494
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,760
we really had raunchy language.

495
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,680
And so this kinda reminds me of that.

496
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,430
And so I was like, "Oh, my happy spot."

497
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,450
But one is called a CRAP board,

498
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,240
and for years, all I could
remember that it was this trap

499
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,180
but what CRAP stands for
is conflicts, resistances,

500
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,850
anxieties and problems
or procrastinations.

501
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,830
So conflicts, resistances, anxieties

502
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,649
and procrastinations and problems.

503
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,130
And so the idea here is our
brains get really stressed out

504
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,700
trying to hold all of the
information that is troubling us.

505
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,120
And so instead you get a piece of paper

506
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,919
and now this is not very
cyber secure high techie

507
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,670
but it works best for your brain.

508
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,640
As you get a good old
fashioned pen and a paper

509
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,110
and you write down all those
things that are concerning you.

510
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,740
And then just by having it on paper

511
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,270
your brain can stop cycling through all

512
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,960
of those things and
knows that you have it.

513
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,740
And so then, the next thing
to do is to look at that list

514
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,820
and say, "Gosh! How many of those things

515
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,879
are really legit issues?
Or how many of those

516
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,400
are just my brain remembering something

517
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,100
that felt similar to this,
but maybe isn't this?"

518
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,560
And so then you can cross
those things off of your list

519
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,357
and then you can even go ask other people,

520
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:04,070
"What do I not have on
here that I should add?"

521
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,439
But the goal is not to
burn it or crumple it up

522
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,280
or get rid of it, but
it's to keep it somewhere

523
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,260
where your brain knows, "You've got it."

524
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,070
And then from there, every
week or so you look at it

525
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,110
and think, "Okay. How many
of those things are gone?"

526
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,330
You cross those off, and
then you add any new ones

527
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,800
and it just gets your brain a tremendous

528
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,610
amount of peace just by the simple project

529
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,209
that it helps you just unrev a little bit.

530
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,853
So that's one that I love a lot.

531
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:38,445
- That's great.

532
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:39,837
No, that's very, very helpful.

533
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:42,818
I like the acronym, a CRAP board.

534
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:43,889
(Ed chuckles)

535
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,445
- I'm sure that's gonna
resonate with many of our

536
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:47,913
(Carol laughs) viewers.

537
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,025
- I was so proud of myself
when I could remember

538
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:53,187
what it actually meant.

539
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:55,213
(Both laughs)
- Yeah, it's great. Great.

540
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,380
Well, let me, I think that kind of comes

541
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,220
into the home stretch of
our final questions here.

542
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,550
And, you know, I think, one of
the things that you mentioned

543
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:11,060
was the CRAP board really is,
you know, and slowing down.

544
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,220
I think that all too
often we find ourselves

545
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,190
in this position, both from
a leadership standpoint,

546
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,800
as well as just within our
individual team members

547
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,030
that constant always on, always activated,

548
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,453
always having to go a
million miles an hour.

549
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,695
It just doesn't lend itself oftentimes,

550
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:35,496
to being able to step back and say,

551
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:36,837
"I need to take a break."

552
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,610
What sort of process,
what sort of perspectives

553
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,959
can you share with us around
being willing to sit down

554
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,960
and move ourselves away
from the glowing screen

555
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,520
for a second, and actually
initiate a different

556
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,850
thought process or a
different perspective using

557
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,139
a CRAP board or using other methods?

558
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,820
But, what sort of things can we be doing

559
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,270
to help our brains take a break?

560
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,990
- Yeah, so this is the really
hard one because I know

561
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,350
that many of the people
that are in this field

562
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,360
do not feel like you
have the chance to stop.

563
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,649
And I know even in my field
of conflict resolution now

564
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,960
I can work from the minute I
wake up till when I go to sleep

565
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,310
and still feel like I have
not accomplished enough.

566
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,417
When in retrospect, if I look back, I go,

567
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,459
"Wow! I really did,"

568
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,190
but there's always more dragons to slay.

569
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,360
And so here's the rub.

570
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,199
We know that there's a lot of
different things you can do

571
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,850
like get a full night's sleep,
or have a good balanced meal

572
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,459
or detach from blue screens
before you go to bed.

573
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,910
But one of the biggest
things that we agree

574
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,200
in the science world is that meditation

575
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,730
is a really big deal.

576
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,000
And that that actually is better

577
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,620
than your glasses of water and all that.

578
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,929
But if you're like me and
I'm sure many of you are,

579
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,760
you go, "I don't have time to meditate.

580
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,540
It sounds great, but I don't have time."

581
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,527
But the really fun thing
is whether you take

582
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:05,460
15 to 20 minutes in one big lump of time,

583
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,590
or you take one or two minutes every hour

584
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,040
it's the same to your brain.

585
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,960
And so if you can create like an alarm

586
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,310
or a mindfulness bell, and every hour,

587
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:22,310
you just take one to two to
five minutes to just not think.

588
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,330
And so there's a doctor
out of Harvard called

589
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,466
Dr. Srini Pillay and he calls it,

590
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,910
"Tinker, dabble, doodle time,"

591
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,810
to where you might just daydream

592
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,850
or you might just do nothing.

593
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,419
It's about not thinking then
what happens is you free up

594
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,970
all that 98 to 99% of your
brain to actually look

595
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,590
and create some solutions for you

596
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,760
that you might not have given
it a chance to come up with.

597
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,379
So it's essentially, connecting
the dots behind the screen.

598
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,070
And so when you do that, you
actually are known to increase

599
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,340
your productivity and errors decrease.

600
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,159
So like when we had just barreling through

601
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,877
and we multitask, the stats say,

602
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:10,877
"That we take 50% longer and
we make 50% more mistakes."

603
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,600
And so when you slow down a little bit

604
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,230
then you're giving your brain
a chance to do its genius work

605
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,520
that you might not normally have.

606
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,150
And so when you do this,

607
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,870
the idea is that you don't
only just stop thinking

608
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,090
about things but you move away
from the desk that you're at.

609
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,230
So when your brain leaves a room

610
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,160
you get an automatic reset,
which goes back to our

611
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,900
ancestry of fight-or-flight
to make sure that new room

612
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,260
is safe and you get oxygen
flow in to your brain.

613
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,740
So if you can get yourself
to stretch a little bit

614
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,590
if you can get yourself to yawn,

615
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,699
yawning is the fastest
way to reduce stress

616
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,990
and get oxygen to your brain.

617
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,790
Sounds weird but if you do
three to five fake yawns

618
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,610
you'll start yawning for
real and it relaxes you

619
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,770
and it's inspires your creativity.

620
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,770
So it's pretty cool.

621
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,440
And then another, just
quick thing I would say

622
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,770
is that if you can do some brainstorming

623
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,900
about problems that your
organization is trying to solve

624
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,740
and then not solve them for
another, like two sleep cycles.

625
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,780
When you go to sleep,
what happens is you get

626
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,350
this brainwash of all the toxic chemicals

627
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,840
that have built up during that day.

628
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,280
And then your brain also
connects the neurons

629
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,230
that make sense from the
new ideas to the old ideas.

630
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,460
And so you'll be more
creative couple days later

631
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,800
than if you just try to
do it all in one meeting.

632
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,490
So those are a couple little things

633
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,720
that are pretty powerful.

634
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,756
- Oh, that's great.

635
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:41,589
That's great, thank you.

636
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,020
And now we're coming into
the home stretch here.

637
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,000
So let me go ahead

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,960
and get our last couple
of questions on in.

639
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,310
I know the audience is
looking forward to this.

640
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,050
I think we talked about how to
apply some of these elements

641
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,090
into the teams that we have

642
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,253
and ensuring that we're messaging us.

643
00:32:01,064 --> 00:32:03,517
Can you give us some perspective?

644
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:05,010
You've talked before in other situations

645
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,500
around the social brain,
give us some idea,

646
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,860
what can you share about the social brain

647
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,090
and peer debriefing that we
need to take into our teams?

648
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,220
- Sure. So you wanna avoid complaining

649
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,110
'cause our brains don't like negativity

650
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,600
and we're not drawn towards
other people that are negative.

651
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,490
And when we're stressed

652
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,530
there's already enough of that already.

653
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,600
So if you can just turn things
from positive to negative

654
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,270
like for instance, this last
weekend I had company coming

655
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,310
and I had to clean the
toilets and Ed, I really hate

656
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,070
cleaning toilets probably
at the top of my list.

657
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,763
But if you flip it-
- Right here, too.

658
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:38,596
(Carol chuckles)

659
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:39,429
- Yeah, right?

660
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:42,000
And if you flip it and
say, "Wow! I really hate

661
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,620
cleaning toilets but that does mean

662
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,239
that I have indoor plumbing."

663
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,100
So you're flipping things to positive.

664
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,280
You go, "Okay, it's not so
bad," but also to our brains

665
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,060
if we can collaborate with
other people who are doing

666
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,139
similar work and say, "Wow!
This is really tough right now.

667
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,430
There's so much load post-COVID there.

668
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,270
This big project is killing me."

669
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:06,040
And your co-worker or
somebody else to is in another

670
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,490
organization can say, "Yeah, me too."

671
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,180
Then you feel like, "It's not just me."

672
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,480
And that can give your brain
a huge amount of stress.

673
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,870
So just having that chance to connect

674
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,750
with peers can be a game changer.

675
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,830
- Right. Oh, definitely. Definitely.

676
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,350
And would you recommend,
I mean, especially those

677
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,860
organizations that are still dealing

678
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,543
with COVID and keeping people at home?

679
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,940
Zoom works, you know?

680
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,460
Zoom works probably just
as easily as anything else.

681
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,480
I think you'd agree with that, right?

682
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,313
- Zoom works.

683
00:33:37,313 --> 00:33:39,280
It's not great 'cause we
don't have the ability

684
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,520
to get those mirror neurons
that create empathy.

685
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,379
So if you can even do
things that are new shiny

686
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,070
to your brain, to where
maybe you have a socially

687
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,470
distanced meeting, you know,
out on somebody's patio

688
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,760
or on their front yard,
or those types of things

689
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,890
can be really, really great
because right now our brains

690
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,323
like uniqueness and it's really fun

691
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:03,143
when we can interact in person.

692
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:06,130
- Well, I think it all
comes back to me we're

693
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,040
on the, hopefully on the downside of COVID

694
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,029
and we'll start to see ourselves back

695
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,340
in another moment of change.

696
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,130
So what would you recommend
how we manage that change?

697
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,340
Cyber security is constantly changing,

698
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,199
but as we think about a post COVID space,

699
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,734
how would you recommend
we manage that change?

700
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,643
- So I would recommend that the listeners

701
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:31,340
and the audience look into David Rock,

702
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,560
he's a professor out of UCLA.

703
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,690
He has a SCARF model for change.

704
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,389
So SCARFs another acronym.

705
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,659
So the S stands for status.

706
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,529
The C stands for certainty.

707
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,780
The A stands for autonomy.

708
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,800
The R stands for relatedness
and the F stands for fairness.

709
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,250
So the C the certainty
is probably the big one

710
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,840
is connect the dots for your
team, tell them what's changing

711
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,900
and what you expect at that's
going to look like for them.

712
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,177
And even if you don't know, just saying,

713
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:02,060
"I don't know what's coming down the pike

714
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,799
but I'll let you know as
soon as I do, we'll help."

715
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,110
And with the status means
that when we're adjusting

716
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,810
things that I know that no matter what,

717
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm not going to lose any
of my credibility or my...

718
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,260
Even if you're changing roles,

719
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,410
my role will still be
equally as important,

720
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,640
Autonomy is that I get to have some buy-in

721
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,129
that you're not just gonna make changes

722
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,190
and tell me and it's gonna sneak up on me.

723
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,480
Like, "Here we go."

724
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,190
And then relatedness and
fairness is all about that

725
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,370
our brains have this
huge need for fairness.

726
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,440
And so we want to know that the decisions

727
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,400
that everyone's making makes sense

728
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,070
and they're not major.

729
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,236
- That's helpful.

730
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,069
That's very, very helpful.

731
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:39,902
Thank you, thank you.

732
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:40,735
(Carol mumbles)

733
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:42,550
I know we're coming up almost on time.

734
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,380
I want to make certain
it as part of our effort

735
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,350
and I think part of the
overarching RSA effort.

736
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,460
We're wanting to make certain that we're

737
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,970
providing you all as audience members,

738
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,819
first our thanks for being with us today.

739
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,610
But I want Carol to spend
a few minutes to talk about

740
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,510
the things that you can be doing today

741
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,760
and then what you can be taking back

742
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,700
to your teams in next 30, 60, 90 days?

743
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,879
So Carol, can you take us
through some of the key things

744
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,230
that you think the audience
members should do today?

745
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,210
- Yeah. So today we talked
about several things.

746
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,680
We talked about the CRAP boards.

747
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,299
We talked about brain breaks.

748
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,240
We talked about finding
peers to collaborate with.

749
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,259
We talked about slowing down.

750
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,610
And so what I would
love for everybody to do

751
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,970
is take a minute to write
down what could they do.

752
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,339
And then ideally, I would
love for you to have

753
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,810
an accountability partner
who you can check-in with

754
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,350
to make sure that you
do, because for instance

755
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,870
if it's a brain break to where
you're going to start trying

756
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,509
every hour to do it, it's very
easy to just blow through it

757
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,580
'cause we don't have time.

758
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,690
So having somebody to
check in is really great.

759
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,880
And then, on that also will help

760
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,320
balance out that social isolation.

761
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,830
So getting a plan and then
making you hold your feet

762
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,529
to the fire, it's probably
some of the most helpful ways

763
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,703
you can employ these things that are new.

764
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,423
- I like that.

765
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:03,256
That's great.

766
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,870
One more slide, what can
you be doing tomorrow?

767
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,880
So it was today.

768
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,370
Write things down, create a plan,

769
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,380
get an accountability partner.

770
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,870
What about when we're back
in our respective programs

771
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,314
that our teams and we're working away.

772
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:16,299
What should we be doing?
- Yeah.

773
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,800
So that's when you scale, right?

774
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,420
So that's when you take these
things that we've just shared.

775
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,840
That's when you review the slide decks

776
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,370
and when you take it back
and share it with them,

777
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,060
this is might be where you
have somebody like Ed or me

778
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,370
come in and work with
the organization to train

779
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,650
on these types of things on a longer

780
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,410
term and timeframe in there.

781
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,470
So a lot of times people have me come in,

782
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,770
so that I can become the
accountability partner

783
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,360
and further create the knowledge behind

784
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,840
some of these systems and
theories in a much larger way.

785
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,740
But you want to continually
be taking the pulse

786
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,790
of your team, because
if you don't do this,

787
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,850
then what happens is you
just go back to normal.

788
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,620
So it's like new year's resolutions.

789
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,790
If we don't actually have a process

790
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,960
for having effective change,
then we just forget about it.

791
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,850
And this becomes the new shiny thing

792
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,690
that fades into the background.

793
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,180
So I would say definitely find some ways

794
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,980
to have somebody help
you and your team manage

795
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,918
that you are continually checking in.

796
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:19,770
- Now, Carol. That's great.

797
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,598
Thank you so much.

798
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:25,259
For those of you who have the decks

799
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,884
there's a significant amount
of additional information

800
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:30,270
that'S Carol has been
very, very kind to give us.

801
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,220
Carol, my big thanks to
you for the time today,

802
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,589
having a subject matter
expert like yourself

803
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,090
helping us understand stress,

804
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,700
understand not just the mental

805
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,540
but also the physical elements of stress

806
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,690
and some of the ways that we can

807
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,660
alleviate it within ourselves,

808
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,173
take it back to our teams,
and help alleviate it.

809
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,649
It's just hugely, hugely impactful for us.

810
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,430
I know it will be for
everybody on this call.

811
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,042
Thank you again, Carol.

812
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:54,876
- Thanks so much for having me, Ed.

813
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:58,543
It's so fun to collaborate
with you on this.
