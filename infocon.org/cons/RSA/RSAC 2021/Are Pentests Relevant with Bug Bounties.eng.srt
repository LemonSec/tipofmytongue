1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
- Thank you for joining this session,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,840
the Red Team village session on

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,580
are pen testing engagements still relevant

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,790
with bug bounties?

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,200
The is session SBX-XLT2

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,690
and it is meant to be a lightning talk,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,930
but we've modified it a little bit

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,730
to where we're gonna do more of a

9
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,259
it's gonna be more of a discussion

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,340
between the three panelists

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,630
and then we're gonna bring in the audience

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,462
for questions and the answers

13
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:31,860
over the last 15, 20
minutes of the discussion.

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,860
So to kick things off, my
name is Joseph Mlodzianowski.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,773
I am part of the Red Team village.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,150
I also run a Texas Cyber Summit in GrayHat

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,390
and I'm happy to be here
at the RSA conference.

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,740
I appreciate them inviting us

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
and making the Red Team
village part of the conference.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,490
As well I'd like to introduce Omar Santos.

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,060
He is also part of the Red Team village

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,390
and also Phillip Wylie,

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,190
he is also part of the Red Team village.

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,750
While each of us have
our own things that we do

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,620
we're all members of the Red Team village.

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,070
So if Omar, you wanna say a few words?

27
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,589
- Yeah, absolutely so first of all,

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,100
thank you for everybody joining here today

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,640
and giving us a few minutes of your time.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,120
And as Joseph mentioned,
we all three volunteer

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,200
at the Red Team village.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,960
We lead several activities there.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,890
But in my real work I work at Cisco.

34
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,630
I am a principal engineer part
of the PSIRT team at Cisco.

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,229
So we are the ones that investigate

36
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,110
all the security vulnerabilities

37
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,210
for Cisco products and services.

38
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,140
And what I do from time to time

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,530
is also work with many other vendors

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,900
and many other industry experts

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,920
on remediating vulnerabilities

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,250
that affect multiple products,

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,240
multiple vendors, and
coordination of vulnerabilities

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,140
with things like CERT/CC and Finland CERT

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,383
and all the vendors of the world, right?

46
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,960
Including protocol type vulnerabilities.

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,320
But that's what I do for living.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,309
Before that I was actually
doing pen testing for customers

49
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,960
as part of a consultant
gig it's within Cisco

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,590
so we do that as a service,
an advisory service.

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,620
And I also work with a
lot of groups within Cisco

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,980
that we have different
bug bounties as well so

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,269
- Thank you, Omar.

54
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,400
Phillip, you want to introduce yourself?

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,960
- Yes, thanks everyone for joining

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,460
and it's honor to be joining
my Red Team friends here,

57
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,570
Red Team village friends at RSA.

58
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,900
So yeah, I come from a
pen testing background.

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,970
I've got over 23 years
experience in IT and security

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,113
with the past 17 plus
dedicated in cyber security.

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,650
I started out my security
career first year

62
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,600
and a half doing network security,

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,650
moved into application security.

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,060
And then pen testing spent
like a total of nine years

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,070
in pen testing.

66
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,200
The first five years was in consulting.

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,839
I've been a Red Team lead.

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,910
I've also been a Bugcrowd
ambassador doing bug bounties

69
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,430
and also educating people
that want to be in bug bounty.

70
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,250
And I've also worked at
companies where I've managed

71
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,340
some bug bounty programs.

72
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,140
So I've done pen testing
as well as bug bounty

73
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,839
and then managed bug bounty programs,

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,030
so I'm kind of familiar with that area

75
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,230
as well as the benefits.

76
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,420
So this is a very
interesting board discussion

77
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,369
to have today and I look forward to it.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,896
- Thank you very much, Phillip.

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,019
I won't spend a whole lot of
time talking about myself.

80
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,040
I also work with Omar at Cisco.

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,079
My job is a little bit different.

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,500
I worked in federal for
about 10 years doing work

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,170
for different agencies and
a lot of my work involved

84
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,040
doing cybersecurity and infrastructure,

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,760
building data centers and
security and stuff like that.

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,329
And prior to that, I worked
for a refining company

87
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,490
and spent 15 years there
doing just about everything

88
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,490
from SCADA networks to
building data centers as well.

89
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,420
So this discussion is about
are pen tests relevant

90
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,769
with bug bounties?

91
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,120
So from the perspective of pen testing,

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,190
we'll kind of level set you on that.

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,079
And then we'll also
talk about bug bounties

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,899
and level set you on that as well.

95
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,979
So Omar, you wanna kick off the discussion

96
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,085
about pen testing since
you did mention that.

97
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,169
The other thing that I did wanna mention

98
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,160
is that Phillip also wrote
a book on pen testing.

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,590
So if you haven't seen it go
to Amazon and take a look,

100
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,840
book from Phillip Wylie.

101
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,950
It's a great book on pen
testing, especially if you're new

102
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,810
and you're trying to figure
out if it's a career for you

103
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,030
and it's a great place to start.

104
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,510
So I'm sorry about that.

105
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,550
Omar, do you wanna go ahead

106
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,160
and kick off the
discussion on pen testing?

107
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,920
- Yeah absolutely, lets
actually a start by

108
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,920
by having the taxonomy
right of what pen testing,

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,620
Red Teaming zero-day security researcher

110
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,810
whatever you want to call this nowadays.

111
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,110
So from a traditional perspective

112
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,490
whenever I'm gonna talk about pen testing

113
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,490
from now on is gonna be
the traditional assessment,

114
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,510
organizational assessment, or, you know,

115
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,909
depending on the scope,
whether it's an application

116
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,480
or a set of applications
that a consultant will do.

117
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,630
And give me one second.

118
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,290
I don't want to cough in your
year, I'm losing my voice now.

119
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,510
That a consultant would potentially do

120
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,690
within your organization

121
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,780
or that you have a full-time
employee, you know,

122
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,613
doing these type of things.

123
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,750
So at the end of the day
it's finding vulnerabilities

124
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,820
or weaknesses or misconfigurations

125
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,409
before the bad guys do right?

126
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,870
Now traditionally that has
evolved throughout time

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,490
and it's gonna continue to evolve

128
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,240
and that's where probably the reason

129
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,490
of this talk is about, right?

130
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,820
A lot of people actually are saying that,

131
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,849
hey pen testings nowadays
are potentially obsolete

132
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,640
because of a couple of things.

133
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,950
One is because the way that we deploy

134
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,680
and develop applications
is changing, right?

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,460
Like if you look at the
traditional pen test

136
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,620
let's say your scope is
to find vulnerabilities

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,580
in a financial application that
you just created yesterday.

138
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,320
Even if it's that narrow, that application

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
may be actually been
developed with containers.

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,159
That application has been
instantiated with, you know

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,590
things like Kubernetes
that actually changes

142
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,650
on a daily basis and a
weekly basis and so on.

143
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,349
So if it's a two week pen test,
by the time that you finish

144
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,430
a lot of things actually
change in there, right?

145
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,480
So a lot of people are saying,

146
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,690
okay so is that a more effective way

147
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,410
to look for vulnerabilities in our side?

148
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,110
Or should we look for other things?

149
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,410
And of course you have the buzzwords

150
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,700
of moving security to the left.

151
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,270
You probably hearing it the
whole week in here, right?

152
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,236
From different vendors.

153
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,890
At the end of the day, that's
how you address security

154
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,320
is not introducing the vulnerability

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,670
or the misconfiguration
from the beginning.

156
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,940
But that's something that is shifting

157
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,919
but not without automation
and only with, you know

158
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,030
some tools in your development process

159
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,099
you probably gonna be able
to pick up everything.

160
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,940
So that's what I wanted
to actually at least

161
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,120
you know, define what a pen testing is.

162
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,700
There's another area of pen testing

163
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,690
which in my company, we use a lot.

164
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,440
So we do have pen testing,
whether it's because

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,020
of compliance, that you have
to have a third party coming in

166
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,260
and look at an environment

167
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,690
let's say, we're getting,
I worked for Cisco.

168
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,310
So the other sister
element of, you know, zoom

169
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,840
which is WebEx, you know,
if you want to do a WebEx

170
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,260
for the federal government,
you have you go through FedRAMP

171
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,880
that will dictate that you
have to have a third party

172
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,830
pen testing company do an assessment,

173
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,010
even though if you have an army of people

174
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,110
that are doing pen testing
in a regular basis.

175
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,290
So there are other pen testing teams

176
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,290
within our organization,
especially vendors.

177
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,430
And what they try to do is
find zero-day vulnerabilities

178
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,330
with an open book, open source, you know

179
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,710
open book with your source code,

180
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,200
and then, you know try to
see if there's any type

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,229
of zero-day versus actually
running scanners or,

182
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,540
you know very Metasploit
(indistinct)the commodity type

183
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,680
pen testing in that case is
actually going really in depth.

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,860
So whenever I talk about pen
testing, I may also, you know

185
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,830
refer to some of those use cases as well.

186
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,520
So it's a pretty big spectrum, right?

187
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,067
- Alright, thank you.

188
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:21,493
And Phillip, from your
perspective on pen testing.

189
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,390
- Yeah, I think that was
some great information

190
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,770
from Omar and a lot of
this is gonna be dictated

191
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,150
by the amount of time you have.

192
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,140
So if you're like an internal
resource for a company

193
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,130
when I was working for
a large national bank

194
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,960
we had a month to do a pen test

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,260
whereas when I was a
consulting the same pen test

196
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,679
we'd only get a week.

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,859
And you know, the more
time you have the tests

198
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,970
sometimes the more things you can uncover

199
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,090
being an internal resource,
you know, the environment more.

200
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,160
So it's more of a white box type test.

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,000
You've got more of an
idea of what's going on

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,470
but I do think even no
matter what you're doing

203
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,540
if you have your own pen testing

204
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,760
it's always good to have
consulting companies

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,220
to come in from time to
time to kinda grade you

206
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,500
to see how you're doing things

207
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,170
because there may be things
they find that you're not doing.

208
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,410
They may have some techniques
that you're not aware of.

209
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,910
You take some of these
boutique pen test firms

210
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,930
that are highly skilled.

211
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,650
They may be more skilled
than your internal staff

212
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,709
so it's good to augment
with those types of things.

213
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,250
And then the bug bounties
too, as far as like for people

214
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,670
that aren't familiar with bug bounty

215
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,370
as far as their professional
if you're a bug bounty

216
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,920
and you're doing this for
a living or extra money,

217
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,260
you're only paid per bug.

218
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,630
And as a pen tester you're paid,

219
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,290
I get paid whether, you
know, I find a bug or not.

220
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,150
And I, some of these bug bounty companies

221
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,390
also offer pen test as well.

222
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,670
Something they start offering.

223
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,310
Some of these companies have
pivoted more into a pen test

224
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,053
as a service a good
example is like Cobalt.

225
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
They start out as a bug bounty company

226
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,900
and now they're doing more
pen testing as a service.

227
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,010
So I think they're just
the different variations.

228
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,620
And even like Omar was
talking about the depth

229
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,970
of the pen test performed a
lot of your normal pen tests

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,560
like performing vulnerability
scans, validating those

231
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,969
and see if you can exploit things

232
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,810
to some of these boutique pen test firms

233
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,349
that are doing more manual techniques

234
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,310
and relying less on the
vulnerability scanners.

235
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,300
Although we can't rule out the, you know,

236
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,790
the vulnerability scanners
because it catches

237
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,750
the low-hanging fruit
and there's sometimes

238
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,340
things may get missed
if you don't run those.

239
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,800
So I think there's kind of a
place for all those methods.

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,881
- Right? Yeah, thank you.

241
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,680
And for those that aren't
aware of what pen testing is

242
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,109
it's a controlled simulated attack

243
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,620
to identify potential flaws and weaknesses

244
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,850
within a business, a network,
a device, or an application.

245
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,871
So basically what you do as you set up

246
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,260
the agreement or the boundaries

247
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,920
as to what the pen test includes

248
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,630
and what it doesn't include.

249
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,150
So if you want to only pen
test certain applications

250
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,720
you put those in scope.

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,610
If you wanna pen test, like only the DMZ

252
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,448
you put that in scope.

253
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:04,390
And like applications, equipment,
hardware, all that stuff

254
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,030
you can put it all in scope
or you can just do a black box

255
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,350
and tell them, you know,
we're not giving you

256
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,060
any information.

257
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,810
You know, you figure it out
and everything is within scope.

258
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,569
So a lot of what a pen
test happens in a pen test

259
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,470
happens based on a scope that is developed

260
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,460
long before the engagement starts.

261
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,320
And with pen tests I think
we we've seen some relevance

262
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,670
with supply chain attacks
that have just taken place.

263
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,890
We've seen an industrial
control networks that, you know,

264
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,580
have shut down a few in the North east.

265
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,580
And these are prime places
for pen tests to be done

266
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,120
on a regular basis and
like Omar mentioned,

267
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,780
just because you pen
tested something today

268
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,689
it doesn't mean that tomorrow it's safe

269
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,700
because you're constantly
changing the program.

270
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,890
Your developers are constantly

271
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,980
adding new features and capabilities

272
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,840
and then you may be
testing them to some degree

273
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,240
but you're not testing them
in the entire environment.

274
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,000
And that's what really needs to happen.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,296
You have to have a test, a
really good test environment

276
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,730
a really good dev environment

277
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,860
a really good production environment.

278
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,130
So from the perspective of pen testing

279
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,060
do you see pen testing evolving Omar?

280
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,109
This is for you, do you see
pen testing evolving more

281
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,030
to include maybe functions
like bug bounties?

282
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,439
I mean, we're gonna cover bug
bounties at the end of this,

283
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,870
but do you see pen testing, you know

284
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,243
growing to include that?

285
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,280
- Yeah I think that, let me rephrase that.

286
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,310
I will say that the
organizations are gonna

287
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,036
be evolving to include
potentially both one.

288
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,949
Each of them are gonna
not solve the problem

289
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,173
in isolation, right?

290
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,199
You have to have a balance.

291
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,207
You have to have a balance
from forget about pen testing

292
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,470
and bug bounties let's say
done and assist, you know

293
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,940
doing just the normal hygiene, you know,

294
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,060
good source code review

295
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,390
a good software development life cycle.

296
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,720
You know, finding the vulnerabilities

297
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,550
from the moment that you're
doing a static analysis

298
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,803
software composition analysis,
you know, things that

299
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:08,200
that you can do before the scenes.

300
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,610
Things are gonna go folded down the crack.

301
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,910
You have to do as a matter of fact

302
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,699
I just saw (indistinct) mention pen tester

303
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,533
and risk assessment.

304
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,470
You have to have a really
good risk assessment

305
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,303
from the beginning.

306
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,510
Threat modeling comes
into play, et cetera.

307
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,310
Assuming that you're doing all that.

308
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,600
The things that fill bug bounties

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,673
is because you can literally crowdsource

310
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:33,673
what some of the quote
unquote commodity pen testing

311
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,900
can actually do, right?

312
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,540
So yes, you can actually
and they work very very good

313
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,260
for things like, you know,
some expose web service

314
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,439
you know, cloud platforms, et cetera

315
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,130
and where you have the
masses that you give a scope

316
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,780
because all of them as you mentioned

317
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,610
whether it's a pen test or a bug bounty

318
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,350
you're gonna have a scope,
whether the scope is this big

319
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,230
or that big is the different thing, right?

320
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,813
But you give a domain, you say, okay

321
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:01,490
we know you can right now
with RSA conference.com

322
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,260
you can only look at
path.rsaconference.com

323
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,764
and nothing else.

324
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:08,880
But you have hundreds of people

325
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,000
that are looking for
these vulnerabilities.

326
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,090
And only if they find something
they're gonna get rewarded.

327
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,250
So you're gonna get, you know,

328
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,780
you gonna get some budget for that.

329
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,339
In a pen test, it may be that
they find one vulnerability

330
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,632
may be that they find 100, right?

331
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,930
So that's where the balance is now.

332
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,140
However, I'm any of the
two, you cannot say,

333
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,540
I'm gonna have a bug bounty
probably for something

334
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,410
really really depth that
you're gonna open the book

335
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,500
and do source code review plus

336
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,850
developing a zero-day exploit.

337
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,085
And what Phillip mentioned about time

338
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,173
is the most important thing.

339
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,260
Time is one and money is
the second one, right?

340
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,920
So time is money, but at the same time

341
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,959
you also have to have a budget.

342
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,403
Even for the commodity pen test.

343
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,560
And in some cases, actually
you have to go beyond that.

344
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,630
So to your question about evolving

345
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,130
definitely this pen testing
bug bounty has to evolve.

346
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,689
We cannot just stop there, right?

347
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,360
And it has to have a balance.

348
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,810
And some people are now just calling these

349
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,140
more in-depth things, not even pen testing

350
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,850
they're talking about, I've
seen many different things

351
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,790
you know, being referred to,
even in this this week here

352
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,880
with zero-day security researching

353
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,220
that's another name.

354
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,210
Other ones of course, we
have the traditional Red Team

355
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,640
which is a true Red Team assessment.

356
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,100
It goes beyond a pen test, right?

357
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,380
You're doing potential
infiltration of a building

358
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,860
doing a lot of social engineering attacks

359
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,610
potentially simulating
what an insider can do

360
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,380
getting higher through their organizations

361
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,018
looking at HR potential
deficiency that you have, right?

362
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,930
And I'm not talking
about like running a scan

363
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,689
and everything, it's
actually manipulating people

364
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,600
doing a lot of social engineering.

365
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,940
And that is actually something
that with bug bounties

366
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,110
is gonna be very very hard,
I'm not gonna say impossible

367
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,510
cause tomorrow probably somebody invents

368
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,750
something like that, right?

369
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,480
For the, there's gonna be a
very very very very hard to do

370
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,550
as a traditional bug bounty
that we're seeing right now.

371
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,219
Right? And that's what you see in a lot

372
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,661
of these companies, you know,
fairly mentioned one cobalt,

373
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:09,239
Synack, I don't want to
mention a lot of companies,

374
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,410
actually, probably some of you
are from that company here.

375
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,839
But you know, there being
and I'm not talking about

376
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,673
only vendors, right?

377
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:19,720
But the whole industry
we are shifting, right?

378
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,000
But the last thing before I
pass it back to Phillip is

379
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,930
regardless of bug bounties
or regardless of pen testing,

380
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,270
you know, those two terms
what we're talking about here

381
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,870
is very point in time, right?

382
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,300
And especially with Dev Ops environments

383
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,020
so that things change.

384
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,410
That's where a lot of people
that they're more controversies

385
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,069
if you want some controversy here, right?

386
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,360
So is all these even
relevant anymore that,

387
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,270
you know I can instantiate 20 containers.

388
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,890
And then they open SSL
vulnerability that you put

389
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,939
in your report, yesterday's already patch.

390
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,700
Or vice versa that you're
using some Docker hub, you know

391
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,750
image in there for convenience
and you're inheriting

392
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,800
20 more vulnerabilities two minutes

393
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,300
after actually I run my assessment, right?

394
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:05,770
So that's another thing that, you know,

395
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,930
of course you have to take
advantage of the whole balance

396
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,160
of not introducing the
vulnerability from the same place

397
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,674
and you know all the best
practices that I mentioned before.

398
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:16,780
Hopefully (indistinct)

399
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,690
- Yeah, it does absolutely.
Thank you, Omar.

400
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,362
So Phillip same question to you.

401
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:25,220
and I guess one of the
questions that came up was

402
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,890
if I'm in production and
I have this stuff going on

403
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,720
how do I ensure that I stay in production

404
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,220
like if I'm selling widgets, you know,

405
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,320
at Amazon or whatever, how do I ensure

406
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,919
that I continue to be able to sell widgets

407
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,260
while I'm either doing a pen
test or a bug bounty program

408
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,270
- If it's an application
then ideally you want to test

409
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,830
in user testing UAT environment

410
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,210
that you use to test the application in

411
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,470
that way it's not in production,

412
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,110
so you don't have to take it down.

413
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,090
You know, most organizations
are 24 by seven by 365.

414
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,540
So they'll a lot of times
they'll have testing after hours.

415
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,409
And some people also want
testing done during the day.

416
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,050
So if it does break,
someone's there to fix it

417
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,120
but in a test environment,
to get a good place to test.

418
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,050
So that way you don't take anything down

419
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,860
and you have to really be
careful that like in your OT

420
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,830
and ICS environments,
those are really critical.

421
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,030
So a lot of things you don't
see in those environments

422
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,649
or people aren't setting up a
test environment to test in,

423
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,770
because a lot of cases people just say,

424
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,139
this is an OT environment we
can't take down production

425
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,140
or risk injury instead of just
building a UAT environment

426
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,500
that they could test
the pen test in there.

427
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,870
And also kind of add to some of the things

428
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,010
I heard as Omar was mentioning, you know,

429
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,350
I've done pen tests before where it was

430
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,280
like a low level of vulnerability

431
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,300
at the time I went back
90 days to do a retest.

432
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,510
And within that time, someone
discovered an exploit.

433
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,830
Now it was a high level of vulnerability.

434
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,320
So, you know, something is
low today could be, you know,

435
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,852
critical or high tomorrow.

436
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,170
- Right, okay.

437
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,280
So we're gonna just spend
a few minutes talking

438
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,810
about bug bounties, and
then we're gonna move

439
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,730
on to questions and
answers for the audience.

440
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,190
So from a bug bounty perspective, Omar,

441
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,730
actually let's start with you Phillip

442
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,820
since you're already online.

443
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,500
So from a bug bounty perspective

444
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,580
I know you've been involved

445
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,980
with a couple of different
bug bounty companies.

446
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,899
What are the benefits
of doing bug bounties

447
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,293
versus doing pen testing?

448
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,180
- As we kinda mentioned
earlier that the amount

449
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,370
of time you have on a pen
test, like I was mentioning

450
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,030
before an internal
resource typically can have

451
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,550
more time to do a pen
test, then, you know,

452
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,200
an external resource
because the expense of it

453
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,620
So that's one of the
advantages there because a lot

454
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,229
of times these bug bounties
can continuously run.

455
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,220
That's one of the advantages there.

456
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,520
Sometimes people will just run it

457
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,650
for a limited amount of time

458
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,500
but I think it's a real benefit
to let that continually run.

459
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,420
Whether you're doing
that through, you know,

460
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,610
an external resource managing that program

461
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,399
like bug bounty or Bugcrowd or HackerOne

462
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,320
or doing it internally yourself.

463
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,560
So that continuous testing

464
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,710
I think there's a big advantage there.

465
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,180
Plus the number of people to, you know,

466
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,430
you know, most pen tests
there may be a few people

467
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,800
depending on the size
of the scope of pen test

468
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,330
doing a pen test but
with your bug bounties,

469
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,560
you could have hundreds
or thousands of people

470
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,429
actually testing.

471
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,010
And what else is kind of
interesting with bug bounty

472
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,040
is you see like the DOD
and some other areas

473
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,840
of the government have had
bug bounties performed.

474
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
So yeah, one of the big advantages there

475
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,110
is the number of people.

476
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,780
And sometimes what
you'll see in bug bounty

477
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,370
is there someone is really
great at cross site scripting.

478
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,979
And when they do bug bounties,
that's all they go after.

479
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,190
And people that are good
at other types of things

480
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,920
someone that's really good
with cloud-related issues,

481
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,230
you know, they really focus on those items

482
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,120
and learn how to automate
that, find it quickly.

483
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,219
- Right? Yeah, absolutely.

484
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,940
I think you're right about
multiplying the workforce

485
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,740
and you know, crowdsourcing,

486
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,550
some of your security is kind of

487
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,030
what some people say about it.

488
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,720
And so Omar, what would be your take

489
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,463
on bug bounties over doing pen testing?

490
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,409
- I think it's all complimentary, right?

491
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,553
Again, it's a balance.

492
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm not gonna pick one side
that you should do bug bounties

493
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,410
before pen testing et cetera.

494
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,900
But at the end of the
day, I saw in the Q and A

495
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,050
I guess I will take
advantage of this as somewhat

496
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,129
of a Q and A, but I saw a comment from

497
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,510
one (indistinct) Martinez in the chat.

498
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,640
It says with bug bounties you will find

499
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,710
what you can't find with pen testing.

500
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,740
So in some cases, yes, in some cases, no.

501
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,893
So I'm gonna capitalize on
that to explain what I mean.

502
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,230
And there are bug bounties

503
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,430
and there are also bug bounties, right?

504
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,630
So depending on what
the type of bug bounty

505
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,380
the type of application they're
testing, the type of scope

506
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,740
you may be very successful.

507
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,580
Like DOD has been extremely
successful in bug bounties.

508
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,139
You have been seen a lot
of presentations for them

509
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,205
how they can scale and they
have a lot of money, right?

510
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:01,169
I mean, it's not that
we're talking about 100,

511
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,970
you know, people employee,
they have a lot of resources

512
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,500
and everything that is
still being successful.

513
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,160
Now that type of bug bounty program

514
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,210
is not gonna be to the
classified systems, right?

515
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,370
So it's a little bit different,
you know, environments.

516
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,969
So for things like a web service, right?

517
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,950
Some cloud service, something that is

518
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm not gonna mention names of companies

519
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,613
or anything else, right?

520
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,120
But services that you
actually use every day, right?

521
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,300
Some public facing things
that you can absolutely

522
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,020
scale the most, probably
if you want to have these

523
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,050
as far as just finding the
number of vulnerabilities

524
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,300
you probably gonna get
more for bug bounties.

525
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,159
In some cases you're
obligated to do pen testing

526
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,480
because of regulation so
in that case, you're done

527
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,990
because you have a bug bounty program

528
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,500
you're gonna have that checklist.

529
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,530
So that depends on your
geographical location

530
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,530
the type of industry,
the type of regulation.

531
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,670
I'm not gonna go there, right?

532
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,570
However, what I'm seeing
that a bug bounties

533
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,330
and pen testing, but more bug bounties

534
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,679
have to also evolve is
the way that we look

535
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,670
at the reports of the vulnerabilities.

536
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,150
In some cases, what I have
seen not only in my company

537
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,070
and other ones that I collaborate with

538
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,360
is that yes, we find vulnerabilities in.

539
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,820
So a lot of cases actually bug bounties,

540
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,090
I guess, fortunately or unfortunately

541
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,080
we'll find the vulnerabilities

542
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,377
but there are known vulnerabilities

543
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,082
are not zero-days, right?

544
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,440
You're running these updated packages

545
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,200
your things that you can
also do in a pen test,

546
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,483
however, in some cases
they are finding zero-days.

547
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,460
In some cases, those zero-days

548
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,860
and it's not so much of the bug bounty

549
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,240
but the organization that is doing that

550
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,080
it may affect other
people in the industry.

551
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,389
So it may be that the you'll find

552
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,650
that in some application that you created

553
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,075
with that same vulnerability, you know,

554
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:50,500
is probably in an open source package

555
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,370
that you're not reporting
out, or you're just mitigating

556
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,459
and not patching and things like that.

557
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,900
So the coordination of
fixing the underlying problem

558
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,660
has to evolve.

559
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,320
The other thing is that there are a lot of

560
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,760
really cool efforts that
are in the industry,

561
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,070
I know that HackerOne has one there's a

562
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,510
the Internet Bug Bounty Initiative

563
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,150
and where we should do the
same thing for open source

564
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,330
which is everybody here, 90, I think

565
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,889
that the Ponemon Institute
to say that 95% of people

566
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,160
that develop code, they use open source

567
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,850
I would say probably close to 100%.

568
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,340
So finding vulnerabilities in there

569
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,060
we also have to evolve
these type of programs

570
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,800
to be able to scale, right?

571
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,210
A pen test only a point in time

572
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,960
into a third party software component

573
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,170
like an open source component
probably will not scale.

574
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,330
So it has to have a balance, right?

575
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,639
I'm not gonna pick and
choose a side, right?

576
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,000
Again, with bug bounties you cannot

577
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,550
do the social engineering type aspect.

578
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,129
You cannot probably do that
depending on the scope.

579
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,430
So you have to have a
balance between both.

580
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,530
- Okay, and so we're gonna take questions.

581
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,350
So if you would like to type
in, if you have a question

582
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,600
and you wanna ask a specific
person, you can say, Phillip

583
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,879
what do you think about this?

584
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,410
Or you can say, Omar, what
do you think about this?

585
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,330
Or you can say just general question.

586
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,409
What do you guys think about this?

587
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,530
So I think from all
three of our perspective

588
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,860
we believe that, and I
hopefully I won't put words

589
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,209
in everybody's mouth,
but from our perspective

590
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,450
we believe that you have
to have a system in place

591
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,240
that includes Red Teaming, pen testing,

592
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,581
and bug bounties, to be able to have a

593
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,449
you know, I wouldn't say defense in depth,

594
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,450
but more of a (indistinct) try
to look at your environment.

595
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,147
So, and Phillip, you can come in

596
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,859
and say something about
that if you want to.

597
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,409
I believe I understand
where everybody's stood

598
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,710
on this topic.

599
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,580
- Yeah, that's even like
your vulnerability scanning.

600
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,710
It's a tool there's a place for it.

601
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,300
You know, you're doing your
reoccurring vulnerability scans

602
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,720
whether it's every couple of weeks

603
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,410
once a week or once a
month, that's ongoing.

604
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,880
So it's just like your
pen tests are part of it

605
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,937
your vulnerability assessments

606
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,399
and they're adding bug
bounty to another tool.

607
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,760
And one of the areas that
you don't see as much

608
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,560
on the bug bounty is outside of, you know

609
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,480
there's like some car hacking,
bug bounties, some hardware

610
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,071
but one of the things you
don't see as much as network.

611
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:17,770
So a lot of that's still part of the

612
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,660
part of the traditional pen testing world.

613
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,900
And last year I was interviewing with a

614
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,010
a well-known specialty pen testing firm.

615
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,170
And they were telling me
that it's easier to find

616
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,660
web application pen testers
than network pen testers

617
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,000
because of the bug counties.

618
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,260
People are getting experienced with that.

619
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,180
- Right, okay so we do have
a couple of questions now

620
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,770
and I'll start asking them
if a company wanted to engage

621
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,129
in bug bounties how
would they go about it?

622
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm assuming that you're taking
this from the perspective

623
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,970
of the end customer, and you
don't have internal resources

624
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,970
to do this, and you're winding
to engage an external company

625
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,523
to help you with a bug bounty.

626
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,419
So Phillip, you wanna talk
a little bit about that

627
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,190
if you have a company and
your are worried about bugs,

628
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,300
who would you engage?

629
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,623
I guess not who would you engage?

630
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:15,270
Because I think it's gonna
engage HackerOne or Bugcrowd

631
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,680
or any of the other
ones that kind of almost

632
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,060
engage the same way.

633
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,129
But if you want to kind
of talk about that.

634
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,750
- Yeah. I think in my opinion,
I think that's a good thing

635
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,470
to outsource you can do that internally.

636
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,400
You could hire someone

637
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,810
but to find someone that
knows how to run a program

638
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,379
like that, then you've got
their salary plus benefits.

639
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,750
And so it may work out more cost-effective

640
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,197
to hire another company to do that.

641
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,639
And then, you know, you could run

642
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,110
with that one company
for a while and just like

643
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,010
it's a good idea to change
pen testing companies.

644
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,840
You could change to a
different bug bounty company

645
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,340
after so long, you know, to get, you know

646
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,270
a different view of things
and see how that works out.

647
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,590
But some companies do it internally.

648
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,740
So this is gonna be a lot
more, a lot more work to that.

649
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,030
And you'd have to find
someone that really,

650
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,910
you need to find someone
that understands that space

651
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,870
to be able come in to
set up all the process

652
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,256
and procedures for that.

653
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:04,800
And someone also asked the question

654
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,100
about vulnerability disclosure
program so this kind of fits

655
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,490
in well too disclose that
has some good information

656
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,570
on disclosure, but yeah, you could either

657
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,139
hire a third-party to
do it or do it yourself.

658
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,020
And another option would
be, is to bring in someone

659
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,490
like a Budcrowd or HackerOne
and kinda learn how they do it

660
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,510
develop that internal
knowledge and then take it

661
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,453
over internally if you want it to.

662
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,690
- Okay, alright, thank you.

663
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,930
Omar did you wanna add anything to that?

664
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,763
- Yeah and as a matter of fact

665
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:34,689
I'm just looking at all the questions.

666
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,700
Some of them (indistinct)
answering some of them,

667
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,910
but to answer that one,
actually both of them,

668
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,620
cause you you went into
vulnerability disclosure.

669
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,332
So disclosure is super
important from, you know,

670
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,800
it's very close to my heart

671
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,850
because that's what I do for a living.

672
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,850
And whether you have a
pen test that is internal

673
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,149
is only to you, you don't
have to disclose that much.

674
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,580
If you have a bug bounty and
the vulnerability is only

675
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,949
to you and this can affect others

676
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,270
or there are companies that
basically they just go silent.

677
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,190
They don't have a vulnerability
disclosure program.

678
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,690
They don't have a vulnerability
disclosure policy.

679
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,632
So, you know, in some cases

680
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:15,250
some of these bug bounties are private.

681
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:20,250
They're not, you know, known
so in some of those engagements

682
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,920
they may require that
there's no public write-ups

683
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,980
of the vulnerability.

684
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,323
So it's all over, right?

685
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,870
I'm not gonna say which
one is better, right.

686
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,709
But what I always suggest is at least have

687
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,870
a couple of things.

688
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,469
Whether you have a bug bounty or not

689
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,470
number one thing is having

690
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,880
a vulnerability disclosure program policy

691
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,880
that you can then, you know,
if something goes sideways

692
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,660
or anything you can
actually always refer to it.

693
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,690
Second to people to know
how to contact you, right?

694
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,720
Whether again, you're paying money or not.

695
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,400
But if somebody finds a
vulnerability in your site

696
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,940
as something that we super
struggle all over, you know,

697
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,580
regardless of bug bounties and pen test,

698
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,340
there's a lot of effort in the industry

699
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,550
like securitytxt.org you go there.

700
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,720
And they also, the guys from discloser.io

701
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:12,570
are trying to actually come
up with innovative ways

702
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,780
on how to put the vulnerability
program information

703
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,610
your policy, your contact information,

704
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,330
your PGP keys in a DNS text record.

705
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,330
So we have to definitely modernize
the practice that we have

706
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,620
on vulnerability disclosure
the policies and everything.

707
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,270
And then the other thing,
another question that came in

708
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,230
and I'm super eager to answer is by Sam.

709
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,530
Sam asked any thoughts on where
Breach and Attack Simulation

710
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,870
BAS fits in kind of a hybrid
type of approach, right?

711
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,639
So now in the industry, I laugh

712
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,610
because we have so many buzzwords, right?

713
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,919
For many different
things, we have Red Teams

714
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,850
Purple teams, you know, Blue teams, CSAG,

715
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,340
the SAG, the SOAR the same,
you know, so many acronyms

716
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,830
but anyways, adversary emulation

717
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,474
absolutely has its place, right?

718
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:05,490
As a matter of fact, another
way that you can scale

719
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,310
even if you don't have
a bug bounty, right?

720
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,350
Let's say you're an enterprise customer.

721
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,790
You have just a few applications

722
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,180
and you don't have a lot of budget.

723
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,380
A lot of things that you can do as far

724
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,450
as emulating what an adversary can do.

725
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,650
So it's a balance, right?

726
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,570
It's not so only dedicating 100%

727
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,679
of your budget in pen testing,

728
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,940
or 80% in bug bounties
and 20% in bug testing.

729
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,480
It's not like that, you have
to have a balanced approach

730
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,230
merging the two with
that type of automation

731
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,000
especially adversary emulations.

732
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,170
Even if you don't have the
resources starting using tools

733
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,080
like CALDERA from MITRE, right?

734
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,562
And then go through the
MITRE ATT&CK Framework

735
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:45,200
and try to emulate that, you know,

736
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,074
with different agents and
then try to find gaps,

737
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,090
because at the end of the day,

738
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,139
what you want to do is become better.

739
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,070
And then learn from the lessons.

740
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,899
If you're dedicating, let's
say 50% of your budget

741
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,360
to actually find vulnerabilities

742
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,719
but you're finding the
same things over and over,

743
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,010
the same weakness that buffer overflows

744
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,310
Cross-site scripting,
Cross-site request forgery,

745
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,100
and you didn't learn
how to actually avoid it

746
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,929
from the beginning, then
it's a moot point, right?

747
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,880
You can't just cancel your bug bounties,

748
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,170
cancel your pen test, you're not gonna

749
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,645
you're not learning from
these mistakes, right?

750
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:21,860
That's the thing that I have
to reiterate the high balance

751
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,508
of everything that you
have to do, you know,

752
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,530
is it's a complicated world, but you know

753
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,780
it has to have a balance.

754
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,649
- Yeah, do you wanna mention,

755
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,210
do you wanna answer the next one

756
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,700
which is how do you convince a management

757
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,700
to fund bug bounty versus
well, they're already

758
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,690
if the already doing pen test,

759
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,750
but management doesn't see
a value in bug bounties.

760
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,490
And not every company will
see a value in bug bounties.

761
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,620
So do you wanna answer that one?

762
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,453
- Yeah, it can come on.

763
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:52,173
That's a pretty controversial one.

764
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,100
Depending on the culture
of the company, right?

765
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,419
You may have to have different
tactics on convincing

766
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,970
you know, to get budget for it.

767
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,230
Pen test as a matter of fact

768
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,300
they are a little bit easier to convince

769
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,723
because regulations in some
cases are actually requiring you

770
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:13,260
that you have to have a pen
test, you know, every year

771
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,310
even if you actually were
able to find more things

772
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,010
with a full-time employee,
you know, internally,

773
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,060
well you have to have that check mark.

774
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,429
So they can not say no.

775
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:26,430
With bug bounties, one of
the benefits from using

776
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,000
not doing it yourself or using a platform

777
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
is the administrative hassle
of the duplicate reports.

778
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,260
How much you're gonna pay
for this stuff you know,

779
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,910
dealing with all those types
of administrative tasks,

780
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,310
reduces significantly.

781
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,889
So if you want to actually
probably just get started,

782
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,600
developing yourself it's gonna be harder

783
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,129
than outsourcing it to a
company like, you know,

784
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,070
I'm not gonna mention, you know,

785
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,250
but there's a lot of
companies out there, right?

786
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,250
And so the way to convince
people that have seen a plethora

787
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,040
of different ways that
people try to do that, right?

788
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,080
One is saying, hey, you
know, these are the goals

789
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,330
of the organization, of new
applications that are coming in,

790
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,069
new acquisitions that we have.

791
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,989
We cannot scale with this team of people

792
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,270
to find the vulnerabilities.

793
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,550
Let's actually come up
with a bug bounty program.

794
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,090
In some cases they actually start

795
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,399
an internal bug bounty program.

796
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,239
And we actually have done
that even at Cisco, right?

797
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,250
So we have bug bounties are external.

798
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,360
Some are private, some are a
bit of acquisitions like Meraki

799
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,159
and we have done internal
and we're kind of spoiled

800
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,679
because we have security research
teams that are doing that

801
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,000
and we have different things,
but in a traditional sense,

802
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,510
in many cases, what you
do is you show proof

803
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,139
that there's some value into it

804
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,060
rather than just say, hey,
give me a million dollars.

805
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,000
So I can just, you know, hopefully hope

806
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,500
that somebody is gonna report it whenever.

807
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,030
You can actually start
developing small environments.

808
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,330
And I always recommend
that don't only concentrate

809
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,950
on developing just an external
outsource bug bounty program

810
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,950
just have that culture in your system

811
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,660
that are in your environment

812
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,009
that people now want to actually go deep.

813
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,720
If you are a developer
and you're, you know,

814
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,560
inherited this application,
then, you know spend some time,

815
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,980
if you're actually out of your own time,

816
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,380
you're finding the vulnerabilities

817
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,990
have some type of recognition
program internally

818
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,339
doesn't have to be monetarily.

819
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,200
That can be, you know, the
hall of fame internally

820
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,859
of the best, you know, developers.

821
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,940
Just look into different
nontraditional ways

822
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,080
to compensate for, you
know, a good guy for finding

823
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,299
vulnerabilities before bad guy does.

824
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,410
Anyways, I talk too much, so Phillip.

825
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,540
- Yeah Phillip you wanna add to that?

826
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,520
- No, that's a great idea.

827
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,340
I really can't think
much more to add to that

828
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,960
and that I like that
idea of rewarding people

829
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,360
and internally get them
involved, you know, like

830
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,460
kind of, you know, kind of
motivate your developers

831
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,370
to learn more about secure coding

832
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,330
and to look for those
things so it kinda makes it

833
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,310
a little more interesting for them.

834
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,993
So I think that's a great idea.

835
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,300
- Okay.

836
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,130
- And we do have one more question.

837
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,880
I don't know if we'll have
time to get through it all

838
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,270
but we'll, I think we have
about a minute each to

839
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,440
be able to talk about it.

840
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,130
It says pen testing
requires internal access.

841
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,590
How is this done from the
perspective of standard

842
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,290
bug bounty platform companies,
obviously a holistic approach

843
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,133
is needed to combine
them all throughout the

844
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,420
any way to replace networking pen testers

845
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,590
with these programs.

846
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,610
Personally I don't think
so, but Phillip, you wanna

847
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,740
again, I think it needs
to be, you need to have

848
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,029
multiple programs in place

849
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,990
but go ahead Phillip and answer that.

850
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,910
Yeah, I think as far as like the network

851
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,923
related internal network
I'm sure there are companies

852
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,890
that do that but you
don't hear as much of it

853
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,708
because just like talking
to the pen testing company

854
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,990
they have an easy time
finding web app pen testers

855
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,080
because of the bug bounties.

856
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,270
So there's not as much that's going on,

857
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,310
I'm sure there is, you
can send a Dropbox out

858
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,040
like you would on a pen test

859
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,500
but one of the things
you're gonna run into there

860
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,960
if you're doing that crowdsourced model

861
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,330
getting something that's gonna
be able to hold, you know

862
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,610
tens of 10 something, 100 something,

863
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,070
tens or hundreds of people to be able to

864
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,650
on that network testing at the
same time do you want that?

865
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,510
Because then that crowdsource
model is putting a big load

866
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,360
on the network and that would definitely

867
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,540
be tested after hours so
I think you'd have to be

868
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,470
really careful the way you do that.

869
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,759
It'd have to be a scale down approach.

870
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,700
You really couldn't go
at it the same way you do

871
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,759
the external application programs.

872
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,220
- Right, yep and that's a good point.

873
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,689
Networking is a specialized field

874
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,930
especially with pen testing.

875
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,549
So the suggestion that
I would make would be

876
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,830
look for a company that
has those resources

877
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,770
that are specializing in
that capability as well.

878
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,830
Omar, do you wanna add to that?

879
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,610
And then we'll close this thing out.

880
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,640
- Yeah, yeah, really really quick.

881
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,650
If you're looking into
emulating what an insider can do

882
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,360
whether it's networking or putting it back

883
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,440
during your application that
you're doing just yesterday

884
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,220
because of supply chain issues

885
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,040
you're not gonna find
that in bug bounties.

886
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,770
You have to have some type
of internal assessment

887
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,803
simulating on what a true insider can do,

888
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,299
find restrictions in your bug databases,

889
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,040
in your forums internally, you know,

890
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,779
things that can actually get a
lot of additional information

891
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,060
that of course an outsider cannot do that.

892
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,487
I know that some of the platforms,

893
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,800
the bug bounty platforms
are kind of having

894
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
that hybrid approach.

895
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,500
You have a bug bounty part
of the same subscription

896
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,320
or service then they can
sell people internally

897
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,197
to emulate that, right?

898
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,770
But it's not the
traditional bug bounty of,

899
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,000
you know, a crowdsourcing (indistinct).

900
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,440
- Yeah, thank you, Omar.

901
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,330
Alright, so I think
that wraps it up for us.

902
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,299
If you wanna find out more

Thank you RSA.

909
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,218
- Thank you.

910
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,143
- [Phillip] Thank you.
