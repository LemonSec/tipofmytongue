1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,320
- Hi everybody, I'm Tom Gillis.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm the general manager for networking

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,279
and security products here at VMware.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,630
And I'm joined with Dr. Chris Kruegel.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,820
- Hi, I'm Chris Kruegel.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,990
I'm VP security services
at VMware and also faculty

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,940
at UC Santa Barbara and
the co-founder of Lastline.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,620
- Yeah, and Chris won't tell you this

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,990
but I always like to, he's probably one

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,169
of the most published throughout
researchers in the world.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,780
So we're gonna talk today

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,750
about some really interesting
trends in security

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,080
which is, we have to make the assumption

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,290
that no matter how good
your perimeter, somehow,

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,000
some way somebody is gonna find a way in.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,940
And so what we can talk about

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,599
are what are the controls
we can put in place

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,400
to stop them once they've gotten in?

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,653
So let's dive into it.

20
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,640
You know, I think we
all know that no matter

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,550
what you do at the perimeter,
there's gonna be some way

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,040
that an attacker can
get a foothold, right?

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,410
There's very, very high profile examples.

24
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,910
Like the solar winds breach,

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,199
where you have an incredibly
powerfully engineered solution

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,489
that took years for the
average surge to develop.

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,619
But then you also have, you
know, much less exotic breaches,

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,780
like at a high profile
credit rating agency

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,750
where you had a single instance

30
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,860
of an Apache server that
just wasn't updated.

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,400
And it wasn't because
someone made a mistake.

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,830
It's because they had
incompatibility that flavor

33
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,740
of Apache stress and the version

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,429
of Linux that they were running.

35
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,260
And so, however it is the
attackers get their foothold,

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,180
we make the assumption

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,350
that they're gonna land
in your data center

38
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,780
and that's not where the damage is done,

39
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,120
but with this credit rating agency,

40
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,953
what we saw was

41
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,360
that those attackers
made 48 lateral movements

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,610
over the course of 9 months.

43
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,780
And this is where the damage is done.

44
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,880
And it's for this reason

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,380
that we believe East West
is the new North South.

46
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,259
What does that mean?

47
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,840
It means that East West internal controls

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,450
and the data center are
actually far more relevant,

49
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,430
far more effective than just
a strong perimeter by itself.

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,200
And this is an underlying principle

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,750
of the zero trust architecture.

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,890
So if these are so important,

53
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,440
why is it that so many
companies today have

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,810
relatively simple or
no East-West controls?

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,500
I was talking to a
customer just this morning

56
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,560
who said like pretty much,

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,040
once you're in the data
center it's any connectivity,

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,769
anybody can talk to anybody.

59
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,603
Well the reason is

60
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,450
because traditional
network security devices,

61
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,790
like a firewall, were
designed for perimeter

62
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,290
and a perimeter was a
thing you could touch.

63
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,540
It's a place you could
insert an appliance.

64
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,537
And so when we think
about East West traffic,

65
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:30,900
and this picture that we're
showing you all those servers

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,570
on the left, they're doing the job

67
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,340
of actually running an application.

68
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,210
And the communication between
them would have to hairpin

69
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,700
in and out of the servers,

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,839
into this firewall that has no context

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
for what that traffic really looks like.

72
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,850
And therefore is very ineffective

73
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,910
at making East-West policy decisions.

74
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,079
So imagine if we could take
that software, that firewall

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,070
in the IDS IPS that goes along with it,

76
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,720
define it as software,

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,930
and break it literally into 10,000 pieces.

78
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,180
10,000 little baby firewall, IDS, IPS,

79
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,650
security analytics modules,

80
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,570
and then attach each one of those modules

81
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,640
to each one of the services
that make up your application.

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,549
This is the power of virtualization.

83
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,600
It allows us to use a
distributed architecture.

84
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,320
I wanna talk to you about just making a VM

85
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,329
of a traditional firewall.

86
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm talking about taking a firewall

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,530
and running it across thousands of pieces

88
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,300
in the virtualization
layer and having it behave

89
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,230
and be managed like one logical firewall.

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,619
When we do this, it allows us
to really think differently

91
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,530
about how we secure East-West
traffic in the data center.

92
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,710
Now we're not subject

93
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,050
to just firewalls.

94
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,510
All of your infrastructure

95
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,700
in a cloud-like architecture
can be defined in software

96
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,690
and distributed across
general purpose X86 servers.

97
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,410
So load balancing GSLB WAF,

98
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,960
even network analytics where
you use the tap traffic

99
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,280
and bring it to some giant data lake.

100
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,820
Well imagine in a virtualized world,

101
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,170
if we turn that model upside down,

102
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,989
instead of moving the
traffic to the analytics,

103
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,010
what if we could move the
analytics to the traffic?

104
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,941
And this is what Chris

105
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:03,774
and I are gonna talk about today,

106
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:05,750
the power of virtualization

107
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,690
to implement distributed security

108
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,240
in your data center and
protect your East-West traffic.

109
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,690
We've done this ourselves at VMware

110
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,760
and we ran an internal audit

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,890
of what does the traffic look like?

112
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,310
And it is amazing what you can find.

113
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,570
Just looking at existing traffic flows,

114
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,060
we're able to identify clearly
anomalous traffic flows

115
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,950
and behaviors that indicate, compromise

116
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,120
and attack activity taking place.

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,370
And we've done this now across hundreds

118
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,450
of enterprise companies.

119
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,210
We almost always find something.

120
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,320
So the assumption that there
no one in your network,

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,940
that's a dated assumption, right?

122
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,210
We can show you a picture
to show, here's activity

123
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,109
that is probably leading to something bad.

124
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,860
And then here are steps that we can take

125
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,050
for how we're gonna stop that.

126
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,883
Now, the way we do this

127
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,020
was there's three legs
of the stool, you know,

128
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,289
on the way in we think
about web app firewall,

129
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,910
and this is a mature technology
that's been around forever.

130
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,380
And yet we still see
breaches that are tied

131
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,150
to the OF top 10.

132
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,299
So making sure that you're running

133
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,610
a software based web app firewall

134
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,700
that's gonna be able to
process all of your traffic,

135
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,420
all of the time is essential.

136
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,790
The second thing is
the East-West firewalls

137
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,290
that I was talking about in
a distributed architecture.

138
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,240
And then lastly,

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,100
having workload security
that is purpose built

140
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,230
for server, running a windows AV system

141
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,217
on your Linux server

142
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:23,690
and the data center, is really
not gonna do a lot of good.

143
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,170
And so having a purpose-built
solution in the end point,

144
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,870
these are the three pillars

145
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,310
of a world-class data
centers security solution.

146
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,900
And we'll talk about how
these things can work together

147
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,803
to really help identify
all types of attacks.

148
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,940
And so what we're gonna
focus on this conversation

149
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,150
is the network aspects.

150
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,053
What can we do in the network
to help bring this to life?

151
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
So we really see three steps
for world-class security.

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,419
The first and most
foundational is segmentation.

153
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,840
I like to say that segmentation

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,159
is like locking your door
when you leave the house.

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,410
If you don't do it and
someone breaks in, you know,

156
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,220
you invited them in.

157
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,630
So segmentation could be as simple

158
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,310
as let's separate my
development environment

159
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,710
from our production environment,

160
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,060
but we can also move it into
tighter and tighter circles

161
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,370
around individual
segments per application.

162
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,090
And segmentation stops
the obviously bad traffic.

163
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,109
I don't need machine learning

164
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,580
or complicated heuristics to know

165
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,210
that production environment
should never connect

166
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,870
to a database in a development environment

167
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,330
ever under any circumstances.

168
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,650
So I wanna stop that from happening.

169
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,349
The second is a little more sophisticated,

170
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,530
which is let's look at inbound traffic,

171
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,380
let's look at traffic

172
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,360
that would appear normal to the network.

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,660
It's HTTP, it's flowing from a web server

174
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,110
and joint app server

175
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,220
and let's identify compromised machines

176
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,120
and malicious activity within
what would otherwise appear

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,290
to be a normal flow.

178
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,010
And we can do this very effectively

179
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,227
with a distributed signature
system around IDS and IPS.

180
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:52,530
And the third step is to be able

181
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,109
to go beyond signatures
and say, "Let's look

182
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,430
at each one of these steps along the way.

183
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,710
Let's look at each one of the elements

184
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,549
that make up my application

185
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,290
and identifying that anomalous traffic."

186
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,050
And Chris is gonna talk specifically

187
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,113
about what we're doing in that domain.

188
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,060
So, Chris?

189
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,310
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.

190
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,100
Let me drill a little bit
deeper into that third step,

191
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,110
that behavior based
network detection response.

192
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,600
And I think the first question
that we should ask ourselves,

193
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,830
why do we really need it?

194
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,099
What is it that it brings to the table

195
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,690
that the segmentation and IDS
IPS cannot deliver on its own?

196
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,550
And I think the answer is the ability

197
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,550
to detect zero day threats,
previously unknown threats

198
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,410
that are spreading in your network.

199
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,210
So you might've used segmentation

200
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,859
to reduce your attack surface.

201
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,840
That is great.

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,979
You're using IDS IPS to look for signs

203
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,110
of previously known
previously seen attacks,

204
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,800
and that is absolutely necessary,

205
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,420
but there's always this
question of what do you do

206
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,300
when an attacker uses a piece of malware,

207
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,440
a threat and exploit that
nobody has seen before?

208
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,070
And this is where behavior
based detection is the answer.

209
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,560
And the question of course
is, well, how does it work?

210
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,330
And I think there are two parts,

211
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,097
or two steps that I wanna pinpoint out

212
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,419
and then we'll dive into much more detail

213
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,080
in this presentation.

214
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,760
One is we want to detect
individual suspicious activity,

215
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
individual anomalies, individual cases.

216
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,080
We have, for example, there's
a connection between a VM

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,830
and service A or between an
application and the file server.

218
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,039
And we need to be able

219
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,170
and we want to be able to detect that.

220
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,130
And then we want to take
all these activities,

221
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,600
all these suspicious events

222
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,630
that we detect within the network

223
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,970
and want to put them together to zoom out,

224
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,500
put the dots together and
tell you the bigger picture.

225
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,980
The key really is sort of

226
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,290
finding the individual
suspicious activities

227
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,610
and then putting them together

228
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,970
to tell you the bigger
picture of what's happening

229
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,910
in the network

230
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,150
to deliver effective
network detection response.

231
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,810
And of course, now the question becomes,

232
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,880
how can we detect these
individual behaviors

233
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,510
when we have not seen anything bad before?

234
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,480
And this question is going back

235
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,970
to the main behavior based, right?

236
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,300
We cannot look at specific
instances of an attack.

237
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,349
We cannot look at how
something looks like, you know,

238
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,190
how a file looks like, or if it connects

239
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,350
to a particular known domain

240
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,090
or a particular known IP address.

241
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,000
We really have to look for patterns

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,050
that are somehow indicative

243
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,949
of unwanted suspicious
behavior in a network.

244
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,280
And this is exactly where
AI will help us, right?

245
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,310
This is where machine learning
and AI can be a useful tool,

246
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,290
like, you know, automating
or mimicking a human

247
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,640
that looks at data that is presented

248
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,260
and trying to find patterns

249
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,860
in the data and trying to
make sense out of the data.

250
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,160
That's exactly what we want

251
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,390
from behavior based
detection as well, right?

252
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,939
We want basically that
the machine sifts through

253
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,380
that huge amount of data
and looks for patterns

254
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,460
that are indicative of
suspicious behaviors, right?

255
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,460
And so the question really
here is okay, is AI,

256
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,800
is ML just giving us
that capability for free?

257
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,329
Is the silver bullet that
we all have looked for?

258
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,050
And the answer is no, we
have to be very careful.

259
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,599
We have to use AI.

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,250
We have to use machine
learning the right way.

261
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,340
And you know, the three V's of big data,

262
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,870
very well known concept, and, you know,

263
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,380
the V stand for volume,
variety and velocity.

264
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,540
And what it tells us
is in order to use AI,

265
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,439
in order to use machine learning properly,

266
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,030
we have to have the right data

267
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,350
and we have to have
enough of the right data.

268
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,830
That's really what volume
and variety stands for.

269
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,020
And if you don't have the right data,

270
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,949
then you don't see the
threats in the data.

271
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,160
You don't have the right
signals to detect it.

272
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,719
And to neither AI nor
a human could be able

273
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,870
to detect something.

274
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,690
So we need to have the right data

275
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,000
and we need to have a
lot of that right data

276
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,070
to be able to properly train
our machine learning systems

277
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,120
so they can then go back
and recognize indicators

278
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,553
of suspicious activity,

279
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:06,750
patterns of these suspicious
behaviors in the data.

280
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,960
And of course, this has
to be done fast enough.

281
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,793
So we have to make sure

282
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,670
that we pick the right
algorithms that are able

283
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,550
to detect those threats
in the data fast enough.

284
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,130
- So, Chris, let me ask you a question.

285
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,363
When I look at some of these
very high profile attacks,

286
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,110
the anomalies are so anomalous,

287
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,500
like there's such a huge
deviations from the norm.

288
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,410
It seems like it'd be easy to detect them.

289
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,833
Is it hard for machine to identify this?

290
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,110
- Yeah, it's a great question, right?

291
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,010
It really depends on the type

292
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,560
of suspicious activity
that you're looking for.

293
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,250
In some cases, it's really easy.

294
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,910
Think of a port scan.

295
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,310
If you have an infected
machine that suddenly connects

296
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,550
to hundreds of other
assets in your network,

297
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,390
it has never done that
before, it's very noisy.

298
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,830
It's very easy to detect,

299
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,990
and you don't need

300
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,880
really very sophisticated machine learning

301
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,130
or AI at all to detect this.

302
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,740
But there are also certain threats

303
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,840
that are much subtler, right?

304
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,940
Maybe it's just one connection
that uses a protocol

305
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,660
that is usual for that machine,

306
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,130
but maybe the identifier
is slightly different

307
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,700
or maybe the timing is slightly
off or maybe taken together

308
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,710
with another of couple of signals,

309
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,940
only in its entirety does
it actually look suspicious.

310
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,190
And I think that is a
very important distinction

311
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,440
because a lot of companies
say, yes, we use AI,

312
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,300
we use machine learning,
and that might even be true.

313
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,420
But the question really is, what types

314
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,229
of machine learning AI do
you bring to the table?

315
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,060
And what is the data that you
have to train these systems?

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,359
So you cannot just pick
the obvious sore thumbs

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,750
that everybody can find,

318
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,950
but you can really
recognize the subtle attacks

319
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,810
that can be much more dangerous

320
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,303
and much important to find.

321
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,010
And, indeed, right, this is where,

322
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,250
I think it's important to
dig a little bit deeper

323
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,217
and talk about, okay,

324
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:56,319
so how does AI based detection

325
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,720
of malicious network behaviors
work normally, right?

326
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,710
And a lot of systems

327
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,280
are basically implementing

328
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,670
what we have here as the
first step on the left.

329
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,660
They're looking at all
the network traffic,

330
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,589
they're using some type

331
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,310
of unsupervised machine learning model.

332
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,000
That means we're using some
algorithm to find a baseline.

333
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
So, what's normally in my network,

334
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,440
what appears commonly in this network?

335
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,590
And then they try to look
for the outliers, right?

336
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,350
There's abnormal activity
that might stick out

337
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,420
and that can detect certain
things like that port scan

338
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,050
that we have mentioned, but
it is not enough, right?

339
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,390
Because there are a couple of reasons.

340
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,660
One is certain anomalous activity

341
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,150
is just not bad at all, right?

342
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,060
So maybe we have found some outliers,

343
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,920
something that looks like a sore thumb.

344
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,610
And is that a problem?

345
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,870
Well, could it be, could not be right.

346
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,703
We don't know, right?

347
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,380
We need to do more to understand

348
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,060
if that anomaly is
actually a problem or not.

349
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,660
And of course, certain attacks

350
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,439
don't show up as anomalies at all, right?

351
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,360
So there are these two problems.

352
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,770
And so we always encourage
everyone who is sort of talking

353
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,880
to vendors who offer
network security products

354
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,439
and, you know, taught the
use of machine learning

355
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,100
is it's very common to
take that extra step

356
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,980
and try to understand

357
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,170
how you just using
unsupervised machine learning

358
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,630
or are you doing more?

359
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,900
And if you just use
unsupervised machine learning,

360
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,850
how do you distinguish

361
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,130
between benign anomalies and
truly malicious anomalies?

362
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,740
And this is where our second piece,

363
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,610
that supervised machine learning,

364
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,270
threat centric machine learning comes in,

365
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,670
that is very important.

366
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,560
Because supervised machine
learning allows you

367
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,239
to do classifications.

368
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,670
It allows you to tell a
dog from a cat, right?

369
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,199
But it also allows you to distinguish

370
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,040
between a bad anomaly and maybe
something that is abnormal,

371
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,640
but not worth worrying about, right?

372
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,740
And that is really crucial
to be able to distinguish

373
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,690
between true threats and anomalies

374
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,900
that are just false positives,

375
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,660
things that we don't have to worry about,

376
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,810
even though they might
violate the baseline.

377
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,400
And so it's important that
you have both supervised

378
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,780
and unsupervised machine
learning capabilities

379
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,770
to truly find threats that matter.

380
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,460
But then the question becomes, okay,

381
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,370
so I wanna use supervised
machine learning, that's great.

382
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,240
How do I train it, right.

383
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,790
You know, supervised
machine learning algorithm,

384
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,579
you have to, well, supervise
the learning process.

385
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,790
That means you have to
present the system examples

386
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,020
of what you want to find as okay

387
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,680
and what you want to
classify as malicious.

388
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,939
And here, I wanna point out

389
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,360
that the quality and especially the volume

390
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,550
of training data is extremely important.

391
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,880
This graph is taken from
a paper from 20 years

392
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,200
where folks at Microsoft looked
at the detection accuracy

393
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,190
of natural language algorithms,
natural language do models.

394
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,460
And what they do it's musically shown

395
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,920
is if you look at the X
axis that shows the millions

396
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,650
of words of training data,

397
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,980
versus the Y axis that shows
the accuracy of these models,

398
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,740
you can see that the more training data,

399
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,090
the more millions of words you present

400
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,730
to these four algorithms
that are showing you

401
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,870
in these different colored lines,

402
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,740
all algorithms are just getting better

403
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,070
with more training data

404
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,630
and the quality of individual algorithms

405
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,650
in the end doesn't
matter that much, right?

406
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,770
The worst algorithm might
be the best in the end.

407
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,920
If you just give it a
lot of training data,

408
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,089
but the keys, all of them get better

409
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,830
as training data increases,
the volume of training data.

410
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,730
And when we look in the
context of security network,

411
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,230
security becomes extremely important

412
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,520
that you are able to present a lot of

413
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,319
threats to your machine learning system

414
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,070
so it can learn, pick up
those patterns, right?

415
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,790
And for that is really crucial

416
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,939
that you have automated systems
that can analyze threats

417
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,310
and malware, for example,

418
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,219
in a high quality center
sandbox, as we have,

419
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,470
where it's really possible to
classify millions and millions

420
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,750
of threats every day, and
use the data you derive

421
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,280
from these analysis runs to then build

422
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,170
and train machine learning
systems that are able to look

423
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,689
for similar patterns
related suspicious activity

424
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,040
in the network.

425
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,189
So it's the right selection

426
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,640
of algorithms supervised
and unsupervised learning

427
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,150
and the right amount of high quality data

428
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,240
to train those supervised
learning algorithms.

429
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,079
And that brings us to the question, okay,

430
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,099
so what can these NDR,

431
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,740
these network detection
response detections do?

432
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,230
Well, we expect, and we want

433
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,220
that AI based detections work

434
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,260
across the entire cyberspace
kill chains, right?

435
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,790
And that goes from the initial compromise

436
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,330
and initial connections,
that amount, right,

437
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,639
or a threat might make

438
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,010
once they've compromised the first asset,

439
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,500
over the lack of movement step

440
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,430
where they move around
in a network to command

441
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,930
and control and eventually
data infiltration.

442
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,530
And I've just shown a
few examples here, right?

443
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,310
So you can look at beaconing
activity where you don't know

444
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,690
that this is an infected
machine that tries

445
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,480
to locate it's command and control server,

446
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,970
but you see some repeated
check-in patterns

447
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,180
and maybe they are combined

448
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,870
with some abnormal
suspicious DNS activity.

449
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,520
So that will be know,
for example, in the case

450
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,520
of the domain generation,
domain name generation algorithm

451
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,750
and then you're looking at, okay,

452
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,930
so what happens if the
attackers try to move laterally?

453
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,470
Are they using, you know,
different protocols?

454
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,190
Are they moving to different assets?

455
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,290
Are they using different identifiers?

456
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,389
And, you know, do they try

457
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,010
to connect using
different HDP connections?

458
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,560
where they had us look
unusual and suspicious

459
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,790
To the case where, you know,
you can just upload a file

460
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,930
or you might want to be a
bit more stealthy and you try

461
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,040
to hide the content that
you want to exfiltrate,

462
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
lead from the organization.

463
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,280
Again, in DNS and use it as
a corporate channel, right?

464
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,790
And in all these cases, there are signals

465
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,810
that supervised machine
learning algorithms

466
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,649
and unsupervised machine
learning algorithms

467
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,620
can successfully pick up and
allow you to detect threats,

468
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,570
even if we have never seen them before.

469
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,699
- Chris, one of the most high profile

470
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,200
and talked about breaches,
certainly the year

471
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,340
and perhaps the decade was
the solar winds breach.

472
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,070
How would this approach

473
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,810
of looking across the whole kill chain,

474
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,643
how would that help

475
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:03,003
in that type of a very
sophisticated attack?

476
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,240
- Yeah, it really would help

477
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,520
across the entire kill
chain because, you know,

478
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,780
we assume nobody has,
you know, any indicators

479
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,430
of that particular malware,
as you said, you know,

480
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,750
it has been written from scratch.

481
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,000
A lot of effort has gone into it

482
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,740
that used the new
infrastructure that, you know,

483
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,120
we didn't know before,

484
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,699
but you still would pick
up some of these signs,

485
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,270
for example right, the checking,

486
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,270
the DNS-based check-ins where
you might see some strange use

487
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,760
of DNS names to encode
even some information

488
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,750
about the environment where
infection has taken place.

489
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,440
And, you know, so from the earliest stages

490
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,140
of the DNS-based check-in

491
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,870
and beaconing to obviously

492
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,870
when you, for example,
the attackers use their,

493
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,060
that back door to run scripts

494
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,639
that move around in a network, right?

495
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,780
You have this box that is
used to control your network

496
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,879
and suddenly it's creating
all these connections

497
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,240
that it has never done before.

498
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,560
And why is your network
monitoring system connecting

499
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,899
to all these places in
the network to eventually

500
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,270
when data is being leaked out, right?

501
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,360
Depending on the mechanism

502
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,320
that the attackers would use eventually,

503
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,540
there's a good chance

504
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,389
that AI based detectors have
a shot at detecting that.

505
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,940
So I think across all
stages of this breach,

506
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,180
there were signals

507
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,083
that we would expect NBR
detectives to properly pick up.

508
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,470
And, of course, you know,
if you don't have those,

509
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,920
if you just rely on more
traditional techniques,

510
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,080
there's a chance that you missed it.

511
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,210
And then, you know,
those attacks might stay

512
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,023
in the network for quite some time.

513
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,720
So definitely a very
important tool in the arsenal

514
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,440
of everybody who, you know,
is dealing with threats,

515
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,630
like as you mentioned,

516
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,253
the sunburst backdoor.

517
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,310
Alright, so the first step

518
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,419
is finding those individual
suspicious activity.

519
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,120
But as I said before,
there's a second step.

520
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,679
It's not only about
those individual events.

521
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,750
It's about the bigger picture.

522
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,583
Something that they do,

523
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,350
we refer to as intrusions,
others call it campaigns.

524
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,570
The question is you have to come

525
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,939
through these massive amounts

526
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,490
of things that happen in large networks.

527
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,310
You might have your IDS IPS hits,

528
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,730
the firewall might block some connection.

529
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,870
We find a malicious file in our sandbox.

530
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,500
We have some MTA
detections where, you know,

531
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,150
the NDR system detect
some suspicious activity.

532
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,040
And what we really want
is filter out the noise

533
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,340
or put different events together
to tell the larger story.

534
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,480
And it's really a first step tries

535
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,070
to look at identity or tries

536
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,149
to identify relevant threat activity.

537
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,690
And again, machine learning can help you

538
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,090
to identify maybe certain
patterns that a number

539
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,530
of events together are
typically associated

540
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,770
with benign behavior

541
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,960
or you have a number of events

542
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,140
that taken together

543
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,540
are implementing a particular
attacker behavior, right?

544
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,700
So you want the first filter,
this often yields an order

545
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
or even to have of magnitude of reduction

546
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,840
in the individual events

547
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,179
that security analysts have to look at.

548
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,510
And when you then have hundreds

549
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,770
of these security relevant events,

550
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,940
you wanna put them together
and you wanna do temporal

551
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,130
and spatial correlation,

552
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,710
where you're basically saying,

553
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,560
things that belong together,

554
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,040
that happened on the same
host, or that happened

555
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,690
on multiple hosts that are
connected by network connections.

556
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,000
And you wanna lay out that kill chain

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,670
and you want to overlay those events

558
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,010
on top of the kill chain.

559
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,990
And again, this gives you
a significant reduction

560
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,060
in the things that
analysts have to look at.

561
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,070
And it adds also a lot of context

562
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,810
that really makes it easier
to understand if that entity,

563
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,000
that intrusion is something

564
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,770
that you should worry about or not, right?

565
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,460
So that's what NDR gives you.

566
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,530
It finds all these signs
of suspicious activity

567
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,110
and it combines, puts that
together and elevates it

568
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,679
to a small number of
important relevant intrusions.

569
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,860
And again, this is something

570
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,179
that whenever you are looking
into a, you know, in the,

571
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,320
our solutions for your data center,

572
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,510
it's questions that you
should ask yourself.

573
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,970
How much data will my
analysts have to look at?

574
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,610
How likely is it that I have

575
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,050
to sift through anomalies

576
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,010
versus true suspicions of threat behavior?

577
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,120
How much context do I have

578
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,209
for maybe previously unknown threats?

579
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,000
So we find it's very
important to implement both,

580
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,990
powerful machine learning driven detection

581
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,350
and then the correlation
and contextualization

582
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,709
of these individual
events into big pictures.

583
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,720
So that's why I'm super excited about NDR

584
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,910
and why I think it's an
important part in the arsenal

585
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,050
of everyone who is looking
to secure their data center.

586
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,389
But of course, one question
always comes up and, you know,

587
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,160
I've also spoken to many many customers

588
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,610
that then ask me this question,

589
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,530
what do you do with
encrypted traffic, right?

590
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,680
Because you're saying you have an IDS IPS,

591
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,380
you want to use MTA
capabilities to look maybe

592
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,350
into HDP traffic, DNS traffic.

593
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,709
What happens if that is encrypted, right?

594
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,760
You can't see anything.

595
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,610
So are we missing all these threats?

596
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,969
I think it's important to
know that there's a lot

597
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,550
that can be done from the network.

598
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,373
And here we have listed three capabilities

599
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:07,320
that we find are crucial
to address the problem

600
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,370
of encrypted traffic.

601
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,270
The first two, we go into
a little more detail.

602
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,050
One is encrypted traffic analysis.

603
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,500
Basically it means, well,

604
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,990
why don't we just analyze
the encrypted traffic itself?

605
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,540
Why don't we try to extract signal from

606
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,460
what is encrypted traffic
without looking at payload?

607
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,260
And there's a lot that we
can do with machine learning.

608
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,170
The second part is, well,
what if we don't even have

609
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,400
to take information out of
this encrypted connection,

610
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,750
and we're able to
basically wait at the end

611
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,500
of that encrypted pipe

612
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,900
and pull the relevant information out

613
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,750
when it is already decrypted?

614
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,910
And that's very powerful

615
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,940
and really relies on that
distributed architecture tone

616
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,460
that you've mentioned before.

617
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,660
And the third point is
TLS analysis decryption.

618
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,760
And that is I think the most well-known

619
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,350
and most well understood one is

620
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,110
where you basically perform a man

621
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,550
in the middle against the
connection between two end points.

622
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,950
And you're basically
breaking the traffic open

623
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,783
and you're saying, "Well,

624
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:03,379
I'm just looking at
the plain text anyway."

625
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,970
So no big deal.

626
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,060
And so obviously each

627
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,810
of these has advantages
and different capabilities.

628
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,190
We recommend all three
of them to use together.

629
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,330
And let me just talk a little bit

630
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,610
about the first and the second one.

631
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,620
The first one is encrypted
traffic analysis.

632
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,889
So don't break open the traffic.

633
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,540
You're sort of taking this
pipe that is encrypted

634
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,830
and you sort of listening and try to see,

635
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,820
can I understand what's
going on inside this pipe

636
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,010
by just sort of listening to

637
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,100
what signals I can still get?

638
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,560
And so what are those signals.

639
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,210
Well, you can look at
some routing information,

640
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,710
IP addresses, DNS names,

641
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,790
they're easy, but you can
also look at the length

642
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,370
and the number of packets,
you can look at timing.

643
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,020
You can look at information

644
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,320
that was used to set up cryptography

645
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,933
or cryptographic protection
like keys or certificates.

646
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,210
And all this metadata is something

647
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,610
that you see despite the
actual payload being encrypted.

648
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,459
And again, you can use machine learning,

649
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,440
supervised machine learning
models that can train

650
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,100
on this metadata so they
can later recognize, hey,

651
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,990
this is a particular connection

652
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,760
that are recognized as being bad,

653
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,410
because it looks very, very similar

654
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,690
to threats that I've previously
seen in my training data.

655
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,300
So that helps you even when
no encryption is happening.

656
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,770
Sorry, when you cannot decrypted traffic.

657
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,820
So when there's no decryption happen.

658
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,429
Okay, the second part is now

659
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:30,340
that file analysis where we
are basically saying, okay,

660
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,189
let's say the content, for example,

661
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,590
a piece of malware is transmitted

662
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,199
over an encrypted connection

663
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,450
and we can't look into it,

664
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,240
we cannot break it open,

665
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,130
but what happens at the end point,

666
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,570
what happens when the
file is actually received?

667
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,500
And for example, here by VM,

668
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,780
a process inside the VM,
for example, you know,

669
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,540
a server service, maybe even a browser

670
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,760
and then it's written to disk
and why don't we just sort of,

671
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,120
before it's being actually, you know,

672
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,050
in its unencrypted form written to disk,

673
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,409
can we sort of grab,

674
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,410
can we reach into the VM and pull it up?

675
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,720
And then we put it into
the analysis pipeline

676
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,570
that uses static and
maybe dynamic analysis.

677
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,939
And that's something that
the distributed firewall,

678
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,050
the architecture uniquely allows us

679
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,169
because given that, you know,

680
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,840
we have a position in the
hypervisor and, you know,

681
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,959
this is a mechanism
called guest introspection

682
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,790
that can leverage VM tools

683
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,240
to really reach into the VM

684
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,120
pull and access the decrypted file

685
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,010
and then send it into the
malware analysis pipeline, right?

686
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,240
And that can be as simple
as a quick hash lookup

687
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
and you notify as bad
and you can quarantine it

688
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,150
to some more sophisticated
static analysis, you know,

689
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,600
could be an EV scan, could be AI models

690
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,879
that look at properties of the file

691
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,900
to a full blown static dynamic

692
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,310
and, sorry, dynamic analysis

693
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,120
in the sandbox where we
basically take the file

694
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,370
and we run it in an instrumented
environment to understand

695
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,080
if it's doing anything that
is considered suspicious.

696
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,080
And so that is in some sense,
you know, three different ways

697
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,440
in which we can deal
with encrypted traffic

698
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
to provide the very valuable vantage point

699
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,270
that network security provides to you.

700
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,690
- Chris the ability to reach into the host

701
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,730
and extract payloads without having to go

702
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,320
through the heavy lift of breaking,

703
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,889
decrypting all your TLS traffic
seems really elegant to me.

704
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,180
In your viewpoint,

705
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,310
how effective is it?

706
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,100
Like what kind of coverage
does this give us?

707
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,939
- I think in some sense,

708
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,120
when you look at those three techniques,

709
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,469
it's the one that has the broadest

710
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,013
or most complete coverage.

711
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,379
Because if you look at TLS to decryption

712
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,310
it really just works
for TLS traffic, right?

713
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,629
It is already in the name.

714
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,200
If we're able to man in the middle

715
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,970
and HTTPS connection and
SSL or TLS, then yes,

716
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,130
you have the chance to inspect
the content of that traffic,

717
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,293
but there's no necessity

718
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,580
for the attackers to
necessarily use TLS, right?

719
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,169
Yes, it's very common to see
TLS encrypted connections,

720
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,210
both on the internet
and in the data center,

721
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,190
but attackers could use
SSH to encrypt files

722
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,630
or even custom encryption protocols.

723
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,670
And in this case,

724
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,360
TLS decryption would
not help at all, right?

725
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,669
While when we're looking
here at guest introspection,

726
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,650
we see all the files regardless
of where they came from.

727
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,250
So it's really a very, very
powerful mechanism to leverage,

728
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,700
you know, VM tools and
basically pull the files in,

729
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,140
regardless of where it came from.

730
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,930
And then sort of it's if,

731
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,890
by definition more complete
than just TLS decryption,

732
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,890
that's why we're super excited about it.

733
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,430
Okay, so that hopefully
gives you also, you know,

734
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,243
some idea of the often, you know,

735
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,610
often raised concern of encryption

736
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,070
and really hopefully shows you

737
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,070
that these three steps make
sense that Thomas outlined.

738
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,970
And with that, I'm giving
it back to you, Tom

739
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,680
to sort of summarize those defense

740
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,250
in depth steps in the data center.

741
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,290
- Awesome, so, you know,
layers of the cake, right?

742
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,060
We start with the basic
building block of making sure

743
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,290
that we're putting segmentation
and cut it up into pieces,

744
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,470
make those pieces smaller and smaller,

745
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,790
make it harder for the
attackers to move through.

746
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,879
Second step is doing
inbound analysis using

747
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,950
that distributed signature and
layer seven firewall, right?

748
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,783
If it's being able

749
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:25,169
to identify friend from foe
within a given traffic flow.

750
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,320
And then as Chris talked about,

751
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,460
the very powerful network traffic analysis

752
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,220
where you don't have
to worry about tapping,

753
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,230
you don't have to be bound
by encrypted traffic.

754
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,450
That to me is really state-of-the-art.

755
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,260
Now the other end of the wire

756
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,500
in the data center is the end point

757
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,530
and modern EDR solutions that are built

758
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,610
for a server had gone way beyond

759
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,360
what a traditional end point used to do.

760
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,899
So it's not just antivirus anymore,

761
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,620
but we're taking all of the
functions that were necessary

762
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,070
in the end point and delivering
them with a cloud back end.

763
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,960
So the goal here is a light,
light, lightweight sensor,

764
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,760
a sensor that can be
inserted from the hypervisor.

765
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,700
As we said, Chris talked
about like the ability

766
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,920
to reach up into the host
and transparently do things.

767
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,830
We can do that with the EDR
solution that reaches in

768
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,280
and makes it effectively agent less.

769
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,190
And yet it provides this rich set

770
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,720
of integrated functionality.

771
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,820
And so the name of the game
here is simplifying operations,

772
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,480
removing those cumbersome and heavy agents

773
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,980
and allowing your servers to
be deployed automatically.

774
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,800
Now, when we have this
presence in the endpoint

775
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,470
and we have this
understanding on the network,

776
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,410
you got a chocolate meets
peanut butter situation,

777
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,780
a really powerful combination

778
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,899
because that sensor is aware of all

779
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,690
of the processes that are
running in the server.

780
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,710
So let's imagine we have
an Apache server talking

781
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,280
to an app server, okay?

782
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
We know what Apache looks like.

783
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,720
We know what the processes
we should expect in Apache.

784
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,980
Now there may be a new
process that launches

785
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,660
and that doesn't mean it's bad,

786
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,070
but it's certainly suspicious, right?

787
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,320
I call it process X,

788
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,520
'cause X is always, you
know, very, very suspect.

789
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,370
And so we have the ability

790
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,699
to pass this process
reputation information

791
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,120
into the network analysis system.

792
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,360
And so we can actually look

793
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,793
on a flow by flow basis and say,

794
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,750
we know here's a process
that we know to be part

795
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,080
of Apache and good connecting

796
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,600
to another process that we know to be part

797
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,820
of the app server.

798
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,810
And it's asking for things

799
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,800
that we expect to see on the wire,

800
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,180
but when that process X
asks the app server for,

801
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,070
can I please have 250
million credit card numbers?

802
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,899
Do you think that's a
transaction we should allow?

803
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,680
So it's almost like common
sense, but bringing together

804
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,960
with the context of the
end point and the network,

805
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,080
this is what the industry is calling XDR.

806
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,960
And I think it's the most powerful thing

807
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,780
that we as a team are working on.

808
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,950
It's incredibly powerful,

809
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,800
because it's gonna be able to allow us

810
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,610
to identify those anomalies
that Chris was talking about

811
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,840
with broad, contextual understanding

812
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,439
and the huge amount of
data that was necessary

813
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,673
in a machine learning
and AI powered solution.

814
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,150
And so really,

815
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,640
as we think about world-class
East-West security

816
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,590
in the data center,

817
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,909
there's a fourth step, which
is the segmentation is to go

818
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,780
with the signature based
IDS/IPS, the anomaly detection,

819
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,139
and as XDR solutions
really become a reality,

820
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,180
I think XDR is the new frontier
for how I can make sure

821
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,480
that my data center assets are secure.

822
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,440
Now, none of this stuff really
matters if you can't use it.

823
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,057
Does anybody recognize this picture?

824
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:28,050
The VCR with the flashing light, you know

825
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,530
and you're like trying to
set the clock on that thing.

826
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,950
You ever actually tried to set the clock

827
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,900
on a VCR, like, you know,
this is an age test,

828
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,610
but like I did, and it was
unbelievably complicated, right?

829
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,959
And so our view is,

830
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
how do we take these powerful
security capabilities

831
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,560
and make them easy?

832
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
And again, this is where the power

833
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,340
of virtualization comes in,

834
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,970
you just simply can't do
this in a physical world.

835
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,460
Imagine being able to connect
all of those security services

836
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,150
to each one of the pieces
of your application.

837
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,870
And as that application flexes and moves,

838
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,449
you spin up a new VM, the firewall,

839
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,250
the IPS, the network traffic
analysis, no taps involved.

840
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,600
All of those rules are
automatically applied.

841
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,650
UV motion, an app server
from one machine to another.

842
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,483
Guess what?

843
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:15,360
The firewall, the IPS,
the NTA all moves with it.

844
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,469
So having this stuff be built in,

845
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,209
allows our customers to operationalize it

846
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,570
and operationalize it at scale.

847
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,730
This is something that you
can't do without virtualization,

848
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,620
but in a virtualized world, whatever type

849
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,159
of cloud you're running on,

850
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,690
virtualization is the foundation

851
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,969
that allows us to deliver
world-class security

852
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:37,109
in a highly efficient,
highly automated fashion,

853
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,520
and really enable that defense
in depth for the data center.

854
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,909
So taken together, we've
talked about a complete series

855
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,060
of steps that we can use to enable defense

856
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,529
in depth in the data center

857
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,870
and really protect your East-West
and your internal flows,

858
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,949
as well as you've
protected your perimeter.

859
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,230
It starts with segmentation,
cutting it up into chunks.

860
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,190
The second thing we wanna do

861
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,470
is we wanna add distributed
layer seven aware,

862
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,180
signature analysis to
identify stolen credentials,

863
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,430
compromised machines, flows
that shouldn't be happening

864
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,490
but look like they're okay.

865
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,649
And then as Chris really
elaborated, the power

866
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,820
of machine learning to
identify anomalous traffic

867
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,630
within the network,
without having to use taps

868
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,840
is very, very effective, very powerful.

869
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,290
And the new frontier for us is

870
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,160
to combine both hosts, context analysis,

871
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,319
and network context analysis
together into an XDR solution.

872
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,670
And that's really the
state-of-the-art East-West controls.

873
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,790
We will stay on the line and
continue to answer questions.

874
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,140
Thanks everyone for your time.

875
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,359
And we enjoyed the conversation.

876
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
- Thank you.
