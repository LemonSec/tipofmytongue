1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,060
- Hi, my name is Kim Peretti.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,570
I'm a partner with the law firm

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,520
of Alston and Bird and
co-chair of our privacy cyber

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,950
and data strategy practice.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,286
We're here today to
discuss the panel entitled

6
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:16,477
"Defend forward, moving toward coordinated

7
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:20,610
"Active Cyber response" with
three esteemed panelists.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,650
Randy Sabett, Special Counsel
with the law firm of Cooley,

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,159
as well as his associate Andrew Epstein.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,110
And we also have Shane McGee,

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,580
General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,550
of the company Cofense.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,099
So thank you for joining today.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,110
I'm gonna spend a couple
minutes introducing the topic

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,880
and then we're going to
do a round robin panel

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,440
discussing the topic in more
detail with our panelists.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,019
So the Department of Defense
described defend forward

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,777
in it's 2018 cyber strategy, stating that,

19
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:57,497
"We will conduct cyberspace operations

20
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:58,857
"to collect intelligence

21
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:02,177
"and prepare military cyber
capabilities to be used

22
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:04,797
"in the event of crisis or conflict.

23
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,987
"We will defend forward to disrupt

24
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:10,396
"or halt malicious cyber
activity at its source

25
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:12,957
"including activity that
falls below the level

26
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:15,210
"of armed conflict."

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,979
In light of recent cyber events,

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,430
including supply chain
attacks such as SolarWinds

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,720
and Microsoft and Codecov,

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,150
along with the ransomware
attack on colonial pipeline,

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,450
increased intention is being given

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,300
to what the private sector
can do and cannot do,

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,310
and how to improve information sharing

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,950
between the government
and the private sector.

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,880
To help provide some guidance,

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,880
here is the Cyber Solarium
definition of defend forward.

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,100
Proactive, observing,
pursuing, encountering

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,050
of adversary operations
and imposing of costs

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,850
in day to day competition to disrupt

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,850
and defeat ongoing malicious
adversary cyber campaigns.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,190
Deter future campaigns

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,509
and reinforce favorable
international norms

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,623
of behavior using all
instruments of national power.

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,490
Now, there are some people
who mistakenly viewed

45
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,620
defend forward as purely
authentic activity

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,170
but that isn't what it actually means.

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,059
While active defense,
Active Cyber response,

48
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,770
and hack back can be a
component of defend forward

49
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,290
they are not necessarily part of it.

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,980
So, defend forward
involves cyber activities

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,100
that couple of things are intended

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,290
to affect resources
outside of us networks,

53
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,283
don't rise to the level of armed conflict,

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,230
comprise appropriate actions
that are proportional

55
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,340
to the threat and are
intended to disrupt deter

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,203
and defeat the threat.

57
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,070
So with that as a brief
introduction, Randy,

58
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,100
could you please introduce
yourself and talk to us

59
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,703
in a little more detail
about defense forward?

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,870
- Thank you, Kimberly.

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,260
And thanks everyone for
joining our session.

62
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,929
As Kimberly mentioned, Randy Sabett,

63
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm a Special Counsel at
Cooley based in Washington, DC.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm part of our cyber
data privacy practice

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,750
and spend my time sort of
split between a combination

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,590
of different things, both
on the proactive side,

67
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,670
counseling clients on
cyber and privacy issues,

68
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,630
transactional issues around M
and A, IPOs, things like that.

69
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,500
And then the more reactive side
of things with cyber attacks

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,560
and breaches and those sorts of things.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,690
In a previous life, I was a
Crypto engineer for the DOD,

72
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,650
and it's really interesting
today to be talking

73
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,733
about these topics and sort
of where they originated,

74
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,720
compared to when I was doing this stuff

75
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
many many years ago as an engineer.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,960
So I guess to start out when
we talk about defend forward

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,810
in the context of not just the government,

78
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,000
which obviously has different authorities

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
and can do different things
related to these concepts.

80
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
What we wanna sort of focus on today

81
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,640
is not just the government piece

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,550
but also the private sector piece

83
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,520
and sort of the intersection of the two.

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,359
We'll talk about information
sharing a little while

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,310
a couple of other things,
but I think to start out

86
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,686
when you talk about defend
forward in the context

87
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:39,880
of the private sector, to me, it really,

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,010
it can be broken up
broadly into two things.

89
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,680
First of all, proactively
imposing costs on the adversary.

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,410
And as a result of that,
degrading their cyber operations

91
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,470
or their ability to
take action against you,

92
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,220
your network, the networks of others.

93
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,220
And it's also effective
public-private cooperation

94
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,430
that allows gathering of
information, sharing of information

95
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,890
about threats and effectively cooperating

96
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,923
in a collective defense type of posture.

97
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,710
It's comprised of a number of
other discreet considerations

98
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,789
that we'll be talking
about in a few minutes,

99
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,210
but I think at the end of the day

100
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,359
those two things are the
things to keep in mind.

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,250
Proactively imposing costs,

102
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,653
and the public-private cooperation.

103
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,313
On the issue of imposing costs,

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,930
I like to go back to believe
it or not a quote from 1964,

105
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,930
from a RAND paper, by a
person named Paul Baran,

106
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,840
who was one of the true
inventors of the internet,

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,270
some of the very early pieces of it

108
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,857
and in this report, he
said, the following, 1964,

109
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,807
"We should fully anticipate the existence

110
00:05:56,807 --> 00:06:00,247
"of spies within our
extensively secure communication

111
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,717
"secrecy protection structure.

112
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:05,967
"Hence our primary interest
should be in raising

113
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,007
"the price of the aspired information

114
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:11,347
"to a level which becomes excessive."

115
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,030
So back in 64, there's the
concept of, first of all

116
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,390
assume the attackers
are inside your network,

117
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,570
and second of all, your
job is to impose costs

118
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,280
on the attacker so that
they actually decide not

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,309
to attack you and go somewhere else.

120
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,120
Now, back in the, I'll
do the finger quote,

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,010
back in the old days,

122
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,469
I used to use the bear
analogy here, which was,

123
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,350
I don't need it to be faster than the bear

124
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,500
just faster than my buddy

125
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,000
who's also being chased by the bear.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,870
In the context of defend forward

127
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,713
and a public-private
cooperative environment,

128
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,469
that's not quite the
analogy you wanna use.

129
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,340
It's really more of a me
and my buddy and a bunch

130
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,609
of our friends and different
folks in the ecosystem,

131
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,200
all cooperating and sharing information

132
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,070
on what that bear is doing

133
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,760
so that the bear doesn't attack us.

134
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,050
I think that's the analogy to take away,

135
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,380
but I wanted to emphasize the fact that

136
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,630
this is not something new

137
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,640
and neither for that matter is the notion

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,640
of active defense and
Active Cyber response

139
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,150
which we'll talk about
in a couple of minutes.

140
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,909
So these are not new concepts,

141
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,010
What they really are are new formulations

142
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,730
and new approaches to these concepts.

143
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,320
And to sort of put that in context,

144
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,520
if you think about the
notion of cooperation

145
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,690
and public-private partnerships,

146
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,980
it's helpful to look at
what types of policies

147
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,700
and strategies the government has proposed

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,110
over the years that talk about this.

149
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,660
So going all the way back to 2003,

150
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,213
the national strategy
to secure cyberspace.

151
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,320
The strategy talked about,
and it was an early attempt

152
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,650
at articulating a national cyber strategy,

153
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,830
and it was clear that information sharing

154
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,560
was a core component of that.

155
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,590
Then in 2008, we had the
commission on cyber security

156
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,390
for the 44th presidency.

157
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,950
I was a part of that commission

158
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,890
and the commission was a
little bit more critical

159
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,789
at that time of
public-private partnerships

160
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,260
because as the report said,

161
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,319
the so-called public-private
partnership is marked

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,330
by serious shortcomings.

163
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,330
And the real sort of problem,
was the notion that you

164
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,500
wind up in a status quo,
if it's not done right.

165
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,937
If you don't have workable

166
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:48,400
and effective public-private partnerships,

167
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,280
it results in sort of a status quo

168
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,930
where nobody's really doing anything

169
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,239
and neither the government
nor the private sector

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,943
needs are being met.

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
That was 2008 followed in 2009

172
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,880
by the cyberspace policy review,
Melissa Hathaway's review.

173
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,390
And the re review team found
that addressing network

174
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,699
security issues requires a
public-private partnership

175
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,693
as well as international
cooperation and norms.

176
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,120
In 2015, we had executive order 13691,

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,960
that focused on information sharing,

178
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,980
cyber security information sharing,

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,820
and it was focused on the private sector

180
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,710
and the use of ISAOs

181
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,960
which are Information Sharing
and Analysis Organizations,

182
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,780
and for those of you who know ISACs,

183
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,350
they're very similar to an ISAC,

184
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,510
which is an Information
Sharing and Analysis Center,

185
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,500
but whereas the ISACs are focused

186
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
on critical infrastructure,
the ISAOs are more flexible

187
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,170
and can be broader than just
the critical infrastructure.

188
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,900
So we've had ISAOs popup across a number

189
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,079
of different industries,

190
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,550
and a couple of different
organizational manners

191
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,620
that really become those effective things

192
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,680
that allow information
sharing, effective mechanisms.

193
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,040
I worked on one with a group

194
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,630
that was a real grassroots effort.

195
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,020
They literally met at Black
Hat in a very informal manner,

196
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,160
a bunch of CSOs, and two years later,

197
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,400
we had a formal meeting,
we had membership,

198
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,400
we had bylaws, and they have
in place this organization

199
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,969
that does a great job of
sharing threat information.

200
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,780
Even though the members are competitors,

201
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,780
they know that defense of the whole,

202
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,150
is made better by all of them cooperating.

203
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,840
And so it's that kind of the ISAO concept

204
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,980
that I think we wanna
talk about in the context

205
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,516
of defend forward.

206
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:57,170
The commission in 2016 said
that joint collaboration

207
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,790
between the public and
private sectors is necessary

208
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,410
before, during and after a cyber event.

209
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,230
So we start to see the focus,
not just on the reactive

210
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,720
but also on the proactive and the during,

211
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,593
while there's an attack going on.

212
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,500
Kimberly mentioned the DOD
cyber strategy from 2018

213
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,950
and the notion of collecting intelligence

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,043
and the defend forward concept.

215
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,430
It went on to say that the
government is gonna strengthen

216
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,739
the security and resilience
of networks and systems

217
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,360
that contribute to current and
future military advantages.

218
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,967
And here's the important part.

219
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:41,157
"We will collaborate
with our inter agency,

220
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:43,657
"industry and international partners

221
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:45,610
"to advance our mutual interests."

222
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,470
So you've got this concept,

223
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,540
flowing through all of
these different policies

224
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,400
and getting refined and
getting more focused.

225
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,833
The cyber commission that also
was mentioned by Kimberly,

226
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,590
they looked at and focused on
the need for imposing costs

227
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,070
to change the adversary behavior,

228
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,500
and the fact that defend
forward is proactive.

229
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,230
And it really was, it looked at the fact

230
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,283
that the US has prevented cyber attacks,

231
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,550
I'm sorry, has not created
credible insufficient costs

232
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,859
against malicious adversary
behavior in the context

233
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,510
of trying to prevent cyber attacks

234
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,510
of significant consequences.

235
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,710
As a result, defend forward
posits that the US has to shift

236
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,240
from responding, being in
a responsive reactive mode,

237
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,433
to being in a proactive mode.

238
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,880
And then even as recent
as the executive order

239
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,310
on improving the nation's
cyber security from 2021,

240
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,609
the executive order said the
private sector must adapt

241
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,700
to the continuously changing
threat environment and partner.

242
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,920
Now we're talking about partnering

243
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
with the federal government

244
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,423
to foster a more secure cyberspace.

245
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,120
So building on what Kimberly
said at the beginning,

246
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,120
defend forward is not, a single
point or a narrow concept,

247
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,990
rather it's a combination
of different aspects

248
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,690
of overall cyber policy
and it includes the notion

249
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,990
of Active Cyber response
and active defense

250
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,670
which we'll talk about
in a couple of minutes.

251
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,189
And also the fact that the dialogue needs

252
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,190
to address liability protections
beyond what we have in SISA

253
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,090
and Shane we'll be talking
about that in a little bit,

254
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,180
and ultimately defend forward

255
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,310
involves a balanced
approach that has a number

256
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,020
of interacting dynamics

257
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,319
which Andrew will discuss toward the end.

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
So that's a little bit
more on defend forward.

259
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,980
- And Randy, can I just ask another,

260
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,120
a little bit more detail on this concept

261
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,773
of imposing cost, is that financial costs

262
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:57,950
that the government imposes by proactively

263
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,360
taking certain measures?

264
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,210
Is it the, imposing costs
making it harder for them

265
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,360
to hack into systems 'cause
we're banding together,

266
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,570
as you mentioned the bear analogy

267
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,160
and discussing together
how challenging it is,

268
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,283
but what exactly does
it imposing costs mean?

269
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,093
- I would respond by saying
all of the above and then some,

270
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,600
in the sense that it's not financial

271
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,190
from the private sector's perspective,

272
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,120
at least financial in terms of money,

273
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,400
it's financial in terms
of creating situations

274
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,420
where the attacker has to spend more,

275
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,819
where more might be
money, they might need to,

276
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,533
have better computers, they
might need more computers.

277
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,849
It might be spending time.

278
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,750
So it takes greater time
to get into your network

279
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,610
'cause you have these defenses in place,

280
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,120
or you've taken mechanisms, I'm sorry,

281
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,330
you've utilized mechanisms
or have taken steps

282
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,440
that are an impediment to the attacker

283
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,960
getting into the network.

284
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,500
And even going so far as to
talk about active defense

285
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,830
and Active Cyber response.

286
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,730
Those are all things that
are going to impose costs

287
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,010
on the attacker that aren't just sort

288
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,293
of financial in nature.

289
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,670
- That's very helpful.

290
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,349
I was always sort of,
wondered how it breaks down

291
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,183
in that way.

292
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:23,300
So thank you for that.

293
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,060
So before we get into
some of the hack-back

294
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,130
and active defense in public-private
sector sharing, right,

295
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,320
we've talked about this for
years and years and years

296
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,940
what is holding the private sector back?

297
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,190
And I would also be interested
in maybe we'll cover it later

298
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,740
about the new executive
order which much of that is,

299
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,880
relates to sharing more threat
Intel with the government,

300
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,900
the IT service providers, as
well as mandated reporting.

301
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,709
So, what is holding the
private sector back?

302
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,600
And is that resulting in the
government taking the position?

303
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,710
Well, maybe we need to, require
more information sharing.

304
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,423
- Well, I guess let's start out with the,

305
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,280
maybe perception is the best word,

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,910
because I do think having
worked with a number of clients,

307
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,713
having worked with law enforcement,

308
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,743
both federal and non-federal,

309
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I think the sort of the
historical response is that,

310
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,470
I'm a company, I've had something happen,

311
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,240
or maybe I might not have
had something happen,

312
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,770
but I'm worried, and so
I'll go to the government

313
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,699
and I spill my guts.

314
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,390
Here's my OCs, here's
the concern that I have.

315
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,278
Here's what I think is
happening in my network,

316
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,740
et cetera, et cetera, and
again, I think it's more

317
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,150
of a perception than a reality,
at least in my experience.

318
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,689
But I do think there is
some nugget of truth in it.

319
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,690
Companies don't feel they get
as much actionable information

320
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,170
in a timely fashion from the government.

321
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,730
Now, I think, and this could go off

322
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,849
in a whole separate direction
but we won't go there.

323
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,282
I think there are a number of
dynamics that play into that,

324
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,270
does the government have an
active investigation going on?

325
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,170
Could there be, could that
investigation be compromised

326
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,660
if they shared certain
information that might be helpful

327
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,573
to the company?

328
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,040
So there's a whole bunch of
things that come into play.

329
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,330
But I think at the end of the day,

330
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,330
the perception is not
necessarily the full reality.

331
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,980
I've had a number of
clients who have worked

332
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,890
with law enforcement.

333
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,290
I had two very distinct
situations with clients

334
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,300
where their network would have been owned

335
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,800
much much worse than it ended up being,

336
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,240
were it not for the cooperation

337
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,030
and in one case, an
agent from, I'll just say

338
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,879
a federal agency who
spent an entire weekend

339
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,450
on his own time, tearing
apart a hard drive,

340
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,250
and finding out sort of
what was gonna happen

341
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,460
to that client next and
as a result, it didn't.

342
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,090
So it's a one time, one specific example,

343
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,679
but I think there are others

344
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,450
where the government
does provide information.

345
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,320
It is actionable, hopefully it's timely.

346
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
And I think really what
we need to work toward

347
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,660
is an ability for that dialogue to happen.

348
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,030
And as I always tell my clients,

349
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,680
you should have somebody from the FBI

350
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,500
or some other federal agency on speed dial

351
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,930
and a first name basis
so you can just call them

352
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,070
and bounce things off of them

353
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,153
because they will do that for you.

354
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,130
- I think beyond reporting
to law enforcement

355
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,110
is just DHS and SISAs,

356
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,340
attempts to get more and
more information over time.

357
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,230
And we have SISA, we have
a process for doing that,

358
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,250
we got rid of, don't have privilege issues

359
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,740
with respect to it and otherwise,

360
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,490
and now perhaps the new executive order

361
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,220
with requiring notifications
to SISA may elevate their role

362
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,390
and be another way that they are able

363
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,480
to get additional information
that they're looking for.

364
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,758
So it'll be interesting
to see how that plays out.

365
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:12,591
- Agreed

366
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:14,850
- But let's talk about the
favorite topic of everyone,

367
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,709
hacking back, active defense,
Active Cyber response.

368
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,203
Where does this fit in
the whole discussion?

369
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,920
- Well, let me first start
out and give a tip of the hat

370
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,860
to Anand Shah, one of our
co-authors of our paper,

371
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,223
who couldn't be here today,

372
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,043
he's done a bunch of work as we all have,

373
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,470
done a bunch of work in this area

374
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,373
and talked about this topic
for quite a long time.

375
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,060
And I think if you look at, I said kind

376
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,060
of in my earlier remarks,
we've talked about the concept

377
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,730
of defend forward and some
of the imposing of costs

378
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,780
and things like that.

379
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,770
Active defense, at least for 20 years,

380
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,580
at least in my experience
in an unclassified setting

381
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,020
we've been talking about the topic,

382
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,500
the conversations don't change too much.

383
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,910
I think there's been at
least some subtle changes

384
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,160
over the past few years.

385
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,640
A group of us have been
writing and talking about

386
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,770
various concepts within this

387
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,000
and some of the boundaries of it,

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but it fits in, in a way of,
as we talked about earlier

389
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,020
with your earlier question,

390
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,020
with respect to imposing
costs and moving earlier

391
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,600
in the attack process to
confront the attacker.

392
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,100
So you mentioned
Kimberly, the notion that,

393
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,699
this is potentially outside
of your own network,

394
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,110
that some of these
activities are occurring.

395
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,830
And so that's imposing
costs because the attacker

396
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,803
hasn't even gotten to your network yet.

397
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,370
And it's a set of techniques
at the end of the day.

398
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,113
If you think about it as a continuum,

399
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,150
I used to talk about port scanning,

400
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,110
and we had this whole diagram

401
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,219
of a number of different things.

402
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,580
And even port scanning is controversial

403
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,580
but all the way up to
destroying the attackers

404
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,020
facilities physically.

405
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,800
Well certainly the private sector

406
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,500
is not gonna be doing that.

407
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
But there are several things
that people have proposed

408
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,710
that that could be used to actually

409
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,130
from a defend forward standpoint,

410
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,583
put in place those additional
costs on the attacker.

411
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,010
- And are you talking mostly
about the government doing this

412
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,053
or in this context right
now, the private sector?

413
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,630
- Well, that's, again, going back

414
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,363
to the historical
discussions, I think people,

415
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,910
used to think of active defense

416
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,585
as the wild wild west,
then I'm just gonna,

417
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:00,420
find the best attack tools that I can,

418
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,090
or maybe come up with them myself

419
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,203
and go after the cyber attackers.

420
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,790
I think the more realistic
view that's being

421
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,350
taken these days is that
it is a cooperative effort

422
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,110
between government and private sector.

423
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,959
Private sector is not doing things

424
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,453
outside of their swim lane.

425
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:24,520
Collectively we are saying that if,

426
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,540
an action that is illegal

427
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,080
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

428
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,133
is not something that we would advocate.

429
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,020
And we would in fact discourage,

430
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,370
that's again going back
to the authorities,

431
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,929
the government has certain authorities

432
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,720
that the public I'm sorry,
the private sector does not.

433
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,720
And so from, however, from a
defend forward perspective,

434
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,649
there can be things one,

435
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,400
I think one very well
used example is the notion

436
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,233
of a honeypot.

437
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
I've developed a honeypot.

438
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,960
I've collected some
interesting information.

439
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,600
Should I take action on it?

440
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,669
Probably not.

441
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,420
If it's, truly is for
example a nation state kind

442
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,910
of attack or situation.

443
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,920
But turning that over to the government

444
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,760
having that dialogue with
the government that we talked

445
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
about a minute ago, I
think would be a good way

446
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,760
of taking the information
that I've developed,

447
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,420
and providing it to someone
who could then take it further

448
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,713
in this defend forward fashion.

449
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,980
So, again I think it's that acquisition

450
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,560
of actionable intelligence.

451
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,520
I can do things that, collect information.

452
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,435
I can work with the government

453
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:50,435
in a public-private partnership
or dialogue kind of way,

454
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,110
and then have those real time responses

455
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,000
that perhaps do come from me,

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,280
If it's nothing else, maybe
it's some diversionary response

457
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,223
or response from the government
if it's something that is,

458
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,950
if it's something that the
actions that we've discovered

459
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,780
if they weren't action by the government

460
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,930
then the government can go forward.

461
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,900
The example I like to talk about is,

462
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,990
imagine if various companies
who might be affected

463
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,810
by some of these supply
chain attacks very early on,

464
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,120
had the intelligence and
provided it to the government

465
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,296
and the government could triangulate on,

466
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:29,800
"Hey, there's something about to happen."

467
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,070
And then share that with the community.

468
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,320
That's the kind of thing
we're talking about.

469
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,300
- And again, active defense
and Active Cyber Defense are,

470
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,250
Active Cyber response are
synonymous in this context

471
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,130
with those two factors
you're talking about

472
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,233
or is there a meaningful difference?

473
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,734
- Ask a dozen people you'll
get 25 different answers.

474
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:53,909
(laughs)

475
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,910
We've never, we the Royal,
we have never come up

476
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,970
with a solid, we, it's
not for lack of trying,

477
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,360
but I would say we've never
come up with a solid definition

478
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,580
or maybe let's put it differently,

479
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,580
a unanimous or nearly
unanimously accepted definition.

480
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,100
I prefer, I'll have my colleagues

481
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,010
weigh in at some point
during their discussion

482
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,310
but I prefer Active Cyber response,

483
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,320
because you're actively
doing something potentially

484
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,197
from a defend forward
perspective, outside your network.

485
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:34,480
It's a cyber action and it's in response

486
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,950
to something not necessarily reactive,

487
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,930
not necessarily an attack,

488
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,810
but it's a response to
something that you're seeing

489
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,850
or you're concerned about or
something you've detected.

490
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,850
I think active defense is sort of the next

491
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,440
least objectionable, in the
sense that it has the notion

492
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,350
of active and defense of your network.

493
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,719
I think one of the problems with it is,

494
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,770
it was one of the earliest
phrases to be adopted

495
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,770
and so therefore got
viewed in a negative way

496
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,940
or a negative connotation.

497
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,280
And that hacked back, I
just, I absolutely don't like

498
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,730
'cause that's really only
talking about the stuff

499
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,580
that we're saying the
private sector can't do.

500
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,610
If it's gonna be a violation

501
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,610
of the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act, i.e, hacking,

502
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,443
then it's not something
that we condone or advocate.

503
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,570
But I think the notion of
hack-back people hear that term

504
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,950
and they think of it
covering whole continuum

505
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,500
that I've been talking
about when it's really only,

506
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,190
I view it as only the
things that are true hacking

507
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,030
which we're saying you
shouldn't be doing anyway.

508
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,440
So that helps?

509
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,320
- You might have covered this,

510
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,330
but how does private sector
Active Cyber Defense play

511
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,983
into the Department of Defense's
defend forward strategy?

512
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,979
- Well, I think it's kind of
what I talked about earlier

513
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,980
in terms of being able
to provide information

514
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,270
to the government perhaps
about things outside

515
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,223
of your network, perhaps about,

516
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:21,950
there was a company for awhile,

517
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,610
I don't think they do this
anymore, but one of the vendors,

518
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,280
one of the first vendors
actually that I saw that talked

519
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,760
about active defense, but
what they were really talking

520
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,080
about was active defense
inside of your own network

521
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,149
which sort of confused
things even further.

522
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,860
But I think it's that combination

523
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,860
of activities that will
allow this overall effort

524
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,899
of defend forward, both the combination

525
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,750
of both private sector and
the government to take action

526
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,750
that will defend our overall
network for the country.

527
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,970
If you think about it
from a, what a lot of,

528
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,490
I shouldn't say a lot.

529
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,880
Some of the policies that we talked about

530
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,083
a little while ago,

531
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,790
talk about a whole of government approach

532
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,250
and a whole of society approach.

533
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,140
And it's really
integrating those offensive

534
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,500
and defensive measures
where appropriate into a,

535
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,360
and now we're getting sort of theoretical,

536
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,590
but if you view it as
taking these measures

537
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,273
that the private sector has,

538
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,159
or can take legally collect
information from it,

539
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,650
share it with the
government who can obviously

540
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,650
observe other things
that the private sector

541
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,740
may not have access to,
and also take action,

542
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,700
it's that whole of government
and whole of society approach,

543
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,010
that will allow you to, or
will allow the government

544
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,350
to leverage information
collected from all those sources

545
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,990
and essentially do the things
we were talking about earlier

546
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,140
progressively disrupt, deny,
degrade, or in the case

547
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,550
of the government potentially
destroy the attacker

548
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:12,360
or the attacker's cyber
weapons and other resources

549
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,892
within their computers and their networks.

550
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,790
- Randy, one last question in this area

551
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,970
before we move on to our other speakers.

552
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,790
What are the key considerations involved

553
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,113
in actually implementing
Active Cyber response measures?

554
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,720
- Well, I think there's,
there have been a number

555
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,572
of efforts and a lot of
things written in terms

556
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:46,572
of the considerations that
will allow it to work.

557
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,800
Anand Shah, the gentlemen
I mentioned earlier,

558
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,580
participated in the Talon. One effort,

559
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,580
which produced a guidance
that really went into a lot

560
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,950
of detail about both the public sector

561
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,430
and the authorities that
the public sector has

562
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,790
and also some of the
international law issues

563
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,040
and a bunch of other things.

564
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,370
They're now on their their
third set of activities,

565
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,709
the Talon group.

566
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,530
And so there's a lot of
folks who have put together

567
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,800
a bunch of different work.

568
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,780
But I think if for this
conversation and for purposes

569
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,123
of thinking about what
the private sector can do,

570
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,430
one thing, the first
thing to think about is,

571
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,053
who should be able to use Active
Cyber response techniques.

572
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,810
There was a proposal,

573
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,993
I actually don't remember
who came up with it,

574
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,273
but there was a proposal to essentially,

575
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,390
based on testing and
certification, deputize for lack

576
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,080
of a better word, private
sector organizations

577
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,790
that have the skills to do the things

578
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,623
that would be needed by the government.

579
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,520
I'm not saying that's
a good or a bad thing

580
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,350
but I think it's something
that, it's a creative way

581
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,500
of looking at the issue of
who can use these techniques

582
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,150
and when can they use them
and how can they use them.

583
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,870
I think at the end of the day,
like we talked about earlier,

584
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,402
anyone who is going to
take action like this,

585
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,643
on that spectrum that we talked about,

586
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,560
really needs to think about,

587
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,226
is this something that could
be viewed as a computer fraud

588
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:48,790
and abuse act violation, or a
violation of some other law?

589
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,303
And if so, move further
down on that continuum.

590
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,220
Is it any personal organization,

591
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,010
or should we have a certification process

592
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,580
or we should, we have some mechanism.

593
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,260
I think all of these are open questions.

594
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,050
In a paper that a separate group

595
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,960
of us wrote a few years ago,

596
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,930
one of the things, in fact,
I think it was in the title,

597
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,450
was the notion of needing a dialogue

598
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,110
on this particular issue
and getting all of these,

599
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:24,110
getting a collective approach that,

600
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,980
again a majority of
people would agree with.

601
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,020
And so that would be one way

602
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,129
of answering who should be able to use it.

603
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,110
What actions are allowable?

604
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,990
I've already talked about that spectrum,

605
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,320
certainly not all of
them would be available

606
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,490
to the private sector.

607
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,830
Are there temporal limits or other sorts

608
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,889
of guidelines that bound when
the activities can take place?

609
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,390
Is it only after you've collected,

610
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,223
a certain amount of information?

611
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,680
One of the things we talked
about a little while back

612
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,060
in a different paper was attribution.

613
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,810
And, this assumes you've gotten
past the attribution issue

614
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,240
because we don't quite
know who the person is,

615
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,260
or the entity is, how are you gonna even

616
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,780
carry something out?

617
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,560
But at what level of
certainty do you need to know?

618
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,669
So are there those limits that bound

619
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,960
when something can be done?

620
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,050
Who's responsible if
there's collateral damage?

621
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,629
If you attack or if an
attack is carried out

622
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,570
on a resource that looks
like it's an attacker

623
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,210
but it's only because the
attacker has taken it over,

624
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,689
and it actually causes
a problem, then what?

625
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:33,300
Who's responsible for that?

626
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,990
Is there any kind of liability
which we'll talk about

627
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,160
in a few minutes, are there
any kind of liability limits

628
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,123
or safe harbors in a sense?

629
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,780
And then when you look at
this in the broader sense

630
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,460
of the global norms being pursued

631
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,610
by the US and other like-minded nations,

632
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,879
I talked about the Talon
manual a little while ago,

633
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
now in it's third installment,

634
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,084
you've got UN groups
that are working on this

635
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:01,917
(clears throat)

636
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,453
in the context of information
and telecom environments.

637
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,020
And so, you've got all of that,

638
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,030
but then you look at some
of these espionage campaigns

639
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,969
that you mentioned earlier,
SolarWinds and others

640
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,969
and what does that do to
calibrate what can be done here?

641
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,850
Do we need to allow things
to be more aggressive

642
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,730
because we're sitting here
in total defensive mode?

643
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,210
A lot of people are pointing to that.

644
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,310
So, I think at the end of the day,

645
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,023
if these recent attacks that
we've seen prove anything,

646
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,250
we need agreement from not just an active

647
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,730
cyber response perspective,

648
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,060
but this whole notion of defend forward.

649
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,820
How do we share information
with the government?

650
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,690
How do we do things in a
way that create this better

651
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,820
than the separate entities,
when they're all together

652
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,540
they're a better group.

653
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,720
How do we create that in the context

654
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,709
of cyber and defend forward?

655
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,340
So I think we need to look at
that and as is talked about

656
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,497
in the Cyber Solarium report,

657
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,490
and it's talked about
elsewhere, essentially leaning

658
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,564
into all of the strengths
that we have, political,

659
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:23,403
economic, social, cultural,

660
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,360
and in that way, these kinds of attacks,

661
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,270
they're gonna, of course they'll occur,

662
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,759
going back to the Paul Baran quote,

663
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,970
the attackers are going to
get it inside our networks.

664
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,779
But if we actually
operationalize of these concepts,

665
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,710
we will be in a better place

666
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,680
and the attacks won't be as catastrophic.

667
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,513
- That's great.

668
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:45,759
And it's so topical, right?

669
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,360
If you think about the Russian sanctions

670
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,070
by the Biden administration,

671
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,160
key aspect they identified

672
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,759
was the international coordination,

673
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,240
and groups to discuss the
attribution and other things.

674
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,549
So there's so much of what you've touched

675
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,310
upon in the whole of
government approach we've seen

676
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,779
just in the past couple of
months and announcements

677
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,330
in various ways from the
Biden administration.

678
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,910
So very interesting.

679
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,790
Let's shift over to Shane, talk
about liability protections.

680
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,100
And Shane maybe you can start with

681
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,620
a brief introduction of yourself.

682
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,569
And then when we talk
about defend forward,

683
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,390
it would seem that there are
a number of things that could

684
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,290
be done to incentivize the private sector.

685
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,259
Love to hear you talk
about some of those things.

686
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,120
- Sure, okay.

687
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm Shane McGee, I'm General Counsel

688
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,840
and Chief Privacy Officer
for a company called Cofense.

689
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,600
I started as an attorney
in the large law firms

690
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,759
ending up at what is now Dentons.

691
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,140
Running the cyber security
and privacy practice there

692
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,500
with my friend and colleague Randy Sabett,

693
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,700
who you just heard from.

694
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,530
Later went in-house to
become general counsel

695
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,553
of Mandiant.

696
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,060
Mandiant was acquired by FireEye,

697
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,680
stayed at FireEye for a little while

698
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,190
and then ended up here at Cofense.

699
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,040
Cofense is and email security company.

700
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,833
We're known mostly for our
phishing defense solutions.

701
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,350
I wasn't an NSA Crypto genius like Randy

702
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,860
but I am a hobbyist technologist

703
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,650
which certainly helps me in my work

704
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,973
on these issues as they get
very complex technologically.

705
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,420
So the question to me is,

706
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,550
what can be done to
incentivize private sector,

707
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,540
to take a defend forward posture?

708
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,430
And you've kinda hinted
at the solution there,

709
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,200
what I think is the solution

710
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,080
which is providing liability protections.

711
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,009
I've been both as a private,

712
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,420
as an attorney in the
law firms and in-house,

713
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,820
I've seen kind of the
fears, the trepidation,

714
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,910
and rightfully so that
companies feel when it comes

715
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,910
to how far forward they're
gonna lean on cyber defense.

716
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,410
We'll get in a little while

717
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,000
I'll talk about the
Computer Fraud Abuse Act

718
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,798
and some other things
that Randy touched on,

719
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:05,950
but certainly liability
is and removing liability

720
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,854
or getting some shield is the
best thing that you can do

721
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:11,453
to get the private sector
a little more involved.

722
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,149
But before we talk about

723
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,680
the liability limitations themselves,

724
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,690
because there's liability
limitations throughout the law,

725
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,450
those never come for free.

726
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,009
There's always some price on the companies

727
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,003
that are receiving that protection.

728
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,770
They have to meet some standard,
they have to do something.

729
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,250
They have to keep from doing
something to be eligible.

730
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,860
And I think here given the likelihood

731
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,710
that if this ever comes
about, that there would be

732
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,540
a likelihood that there's
gonna be a similar requirement,

733
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,960
I'll kinda start out talking
about what I think the costs

734
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,433
of limitation of liability should be.

735
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,259
I would start with something
like a requiring the use

736
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,260
of trust mechanisms for
vetting any products, services,

737
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:05,303
threat intelligence used
in Active Cyber response.

738
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,840
Certainly when you're
talking about something

739
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,210
that's important the
companies should not rely

740
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,440
on any unproven technology or intelligence

741
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:19,040
and doing so can result
in some dire consequences.

742
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,220
To do that though, these
trust mechanisms require,

743
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,609
going back to some, the things
that Randy was talking about,

744
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,613
a strong public-private partnership,

745
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,069
to vet that intelligence
that you're using,

746
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,730
or the products with
not just other companies

747
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,870
in the private sector but
with your government partners

748
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,670
that have the best access to
information and technology.

749
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,560
The threat information sharing

750
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,850
in that public-private
partnership also needs

751
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,390
to be reliable and timely.

752
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,000
And I think there are historical problems,

753
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,028
again that Randy touched on with

754
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,459
with government information sharing.

755
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,060
I won't get too far into that, but that's,

756
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,529
but yeah, just generally
I think trust mechanisms

757
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,680
and that partnership is
probably the first requirement

758
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,060
a company would need to
meet before it qualifies

759
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,593
for any type of liability limitations.

760
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,290
Another is, comply with some type

761
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,240
of clear rules of the
road for attribution.

762
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,169
And, Randy also mentioned attribution

763
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,492
and the difficulties of it,

764
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:26,580
it's incredibly difficult both
from a technical perspective

765
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,790
but also from a political perspective.

766
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,900
There are political ramifications

767
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,580
if you have a state
sponsored actor attacking.

768
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,640
So even if you do find out
that it's China or Russia,

769
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,700
saying that in a public forum
has certain repercussions.

770
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,109
So again, you lean on your
public-private partnerships

771
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,573
and try to coordinate
the attribution as well.

772
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,243
That's more on the political,

773
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,820
and the technology side of
attribution, also very difficult.

774
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,010
You can have serious collateral damage

775
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,720
if you attribute an
attack to the wrong party

776
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,250
and collateral damage from
your response to that.

777
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,200
None of this works,

778
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,819
what I'm talking about
works without this real-time

779
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,162
information sharing and that
public-private partnership

780
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:22,100
that results in that
but you also need more

781
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,890
than just the sharing with the government,

782
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,359
you need some level of coordination.

783
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,520
And when I say coordination

784
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,740
I'm talking about with law enforcement

785
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,113
and sometimes the intelligence community.

786
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,480
There are, if you think about
a situation where you're gonna

787
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,000
have private companies kind of
leaning forward a little bit

788
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,960
in terms of their Active Cyber response,

789
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,190
I think one of the main
goals of coordinating

790
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,100
with the government is
going to be deconfliction.

791
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,450
You wanna avoid impacting
ongoing government operations.

792
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,830
And you also, if there's gonna be a lot

793
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,100
of other private sector entities involved,

794
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,279
you wanna avoid stepping
on other people's toes

795
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,940
if they're involved in
some type of active defense

796
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,270
or Active Cyber response.

797
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,509
There's also just the
coordination in the sense

798
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,960
that there needs to be
some type of standard

799
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,390
or oversight on
proportionality and escalation.

800
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,859
If the government is, or a partnership

801
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,510
between private sector and
the government is there,

802
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,080
then companies can
coordinate their responses

803
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,790
so that they are not, they
don't lack proportionality

804
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,720
and they can all be
somewhat similar in terms

805
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,263
of defining a practice and
in how people are responding.

806
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,440
So, in addition to the
coordination aspects

807
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,020
we also need some type

808
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,730
of ongoing assessment and certification.

809
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,470
I'm gonna talk about a little bit,

810
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,080
some of the current
statutes that I believe

811
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,299
we could build a template
like this on, but the,

812
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,253
whether this is a government
body or an industry group,

813
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,100
it's up for a whole lot of discussion

814
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,710
but the idea that is that
there needs to be some type of,

815
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,813
if not oversight, then larger cooperation.

816
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,320
And the idea, so I started with,

817
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,550
what you kinda need to
do to get to the point

818
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,690
where you deserve any type
of liability limitation.

819
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,480
If you do all these things,
the idea at that point

820
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,010
is that you should receive some type

821
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,070
of liability protection.

822
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,230
And there are, at that
point, you ask yourself

823
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,310
what are you defending against?

824
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,759
Or what are you trying to protect

825
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,660
against in terms of those protections?

826
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,509
There are two different types
of liability that generally

827
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,440
that you would be looking at.

828
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,300
You'd be looking at government action,

829
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,360
and there are civil action,

830
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,070
and criminal action from the government.

831
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,670
So there are two types just in that,

832
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,130
but also third-party lawsuits.

833
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,570
So that's the type of
life liability protection

834
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,140
we're looking for.

835
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,900
Randy mentioned kind of
the big 800 pound gorilla

836
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,420
in the room when it comes to liability,

837
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,200
and that is the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act.

838
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,750
I'm not gonna get too far into that.

839
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,580
I think everybody really kinda understands

840
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,730
what it is generally but it suffice

841
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,022
to say it's very broadly interpreted.

842
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:17,410
It covers a large percentage
of conduct that people think

843
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:21,450
about when we're talking
about Active Cyber Defense

844
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,859
and kind of a defend forward concept.

845
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,940
So if that is the first
and the largest hurdle

846
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,370
you need to get over
before you engage in any

847
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,620
of this type of behavior.

848
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,610
So whatever happens, you have to make sure

849
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,960
that the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act is amended

850
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,034
or there's some type of exception made

851
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,840
for this type of conduct.

852
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,530
But that doesn't mean that
that's all you need to do.

853
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,770
It doesn't necessarily
protect organizations

854
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,600
from third-party liability and lawsuits.

855
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,243
To protect organizations
from third-party liability,

856
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:55,370
you need to do something else.

857
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,410
And there, I think you
probably look at something

858
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,399
like the Safety Act.

859
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,870
Safety Act was to support anti-terrorism

860
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,560
by fostering effective technologies act,

861
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,910
that was passed after 911.

862
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,259
It offers a liability protections

863
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,130
and liability management program

864
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,663
for providers of
anti-terrorism technologies.

865
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,140
Now, this is something where
you take your technology,

866
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,647
you vet it with the government, you say,

867
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:26,500
"Hey, this is what I wanna
qualify under the Safety Act."

868
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,530
And then if you are able
to get through that process

869
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,410
and the government gives
you a stamp of approval,

870
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,600
then you get certain
liability protections.

871
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,600
And that comes in the form
of half on litigation damages

872
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,710
or sometimes just a complete dismissal

873
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,410
of any third party lawsuit
lodged against you.

874
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,910
So you have both going back

875
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,210
to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,

876
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,100
you have to do something
about that type of liability,

877
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,933
the governmental liability

878
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:58,350
and then you might want to
take some type of Safety Act

879
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,319
sort of use that template
to create some sort

880
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,970
of liability protection
against third party lawsuits.

881
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,279
- And Shane, could I just ask
- Yap.

882
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,040
- What is the type of activity
that we're talking about

883
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,460
that we would be providing
liability protection against?

884
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,250
Is it broad ranging Active Cyber response?

885
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,700
Or is it a narrower component
of that type of activity?

886
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,220
- Can I recycle Randy's answer

887
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,720
and just say all of the above?

888
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,799
- It's a, I mean, there, I actually think

889
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,070
that there is a range
of different behaviors

890
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,950
and clearly we're gonna
need to define that

891
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,100
before we start going into
the liability protections

892
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,350
and the exceptions and everything else.

893
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:45,100
I wanna echo what Randy said in that

894
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,520
I do not believe that the, and
if you wanna characterize it

895
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,009
as active defense or hack- back,

896
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,110
is smart under virtually any circumstances

897
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,040
for a private company.

898
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,830
It is both dangerous in the
sense that usually companies

899
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,650
are fighting out of their league,

900
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,050
I guess is the saying,
they are in serious trouble

901
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,220
if they are trying to
put themselves up against

902
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,350
a hacker that was able to
get in their environment

903
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,330
if that hacker is state-sponsored

904
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:22,330
or otherwise sophisticated,
because you don't wanna,

905
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,680
you don't wanna be hacked
back for the hack-back.

906
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,879
So that that's one reason not to do it.

907
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,200
The other reason is just the possibility

908
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,830
for collateral damage is huge.

909
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:36,830
And we've seen, I've seen
several times where clients,

910
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,560
back when I was in the
firms, have not gone after

911
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,700
but done some reconnaissance

912
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,560
to see who was responsible
for their hacks,

913
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,270
it is led back to a particular process

914
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,320
on a particular box
somewhere and then they later

915
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,700
find out that that's
just a shell running out

916
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,930
of a web server, a multi-tenant web server

917
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,859
that's serving hundreds
of thousands of sites.

918
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,872
So if you would have gone after that,

919
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:06,129
you would have shut down hundreds

920
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,140
or thousands of sites that
were perfectly legitimate.

921
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,359
You could get into infrastructure,

922
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,020
they could shut down utilities,

923
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,509
you could do any number of things

924
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,180
and private companies
are just generally not

925
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,299
sophisticated enough to be
able to go after a hacker

926
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,450
in such a way that they could mitigate

927
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,240
the collateral damage that's
gonna come out of that.

928
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,100
So that's a long way of
answering your question

929
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,420
to say that there is this very broad range

930
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,012
of behavior that we're talking about

931
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,760
but I would say that
hopefully we're talking about

932
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,560
just the type of things,

933
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,170
the more passive Active Cyber Defense,

934
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,040
things like the honeypots,
maybe beacons, things like that,

935
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,529
but not the act of trying to hack-back

936
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,683
and take down your opponent,
not that type of thing.

937
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,343
- Okay, that's helpful.

938
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,460
So turning it over to Andrew,

939
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,150
based on what we've heard so far,

940
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,490
it seems that developing
a balanced approach

941
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,509
to defend forward makes sense.

942
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,260
Can you both introduce yourself

943
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,680
and also elaborate on this
in our remaining time.

944
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,310
- Yeah, thank you Kimberly.

945
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,980
Andrew Epstein, associate at Cooley

946
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,273
and our cyber data privacy practice group.

947
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,630
My process mainly involves
advice and counseling clients

948
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,516
for each response, transactional support,

949
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:34,940
both mergers and acquisitions IPO level

950
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,163
and then also on a
commercial level as well.

951
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,500
In terms of the balance approach

952
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,427
I think that to Shane's point,

953
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:47,860
of the things that we're looking for here

954
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,750
is establishing a framework

955
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,640
in which organizations can operate.

956
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,779
And so here we are talking about

957
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,730
clearly following delineated roles,

958
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,610
understanding what are the
limitations on the actions

959
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:06,600
that you can take while
also trying to assess

960
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,690
how you could best go about
defending your own network

961
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,690
and also, as Randy said, imposing
costs on the perpetrators.

962
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,650
And to do this, one of the
solutions that we had proposed

963
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:25,650
in our paper is creation of
a public-private partnership

964
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,980
along the lines an ISAC or
ISAO that allows for sharing

965
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,890
of information both between
private organizations,

966
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:37,937
public-private organizations,

967
00:50:37,937 --> 00:50:41,450
and then the public
organizations themselves.

968
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,450
And this would facilitate
sharing of information

969
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,710
and real time that allows
for organizations to respond

970
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:57,310
to threats seamlessly while
also not the inhibited

971
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,350
by the perceived delay in any sort

972
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,933
of information sharing regime.

973
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:09,910
I think that there have been
efforts to do so previously

974
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,910
but I think with the knowledge
that the organizations

975
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,540
are better when they are working together

976
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,063
as opposed to working in silos,

977
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:25,217
I think that you're going
to see an increased push

978
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,890
toward information sharing
between public and private.

979
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,750
I think that is one of the main messages,

980
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,250
that the Biden administration's
new executive order

981
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,370
is that these organizations
really need to step forward

982
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:44,710
and in a timely fashion share information

983
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:49,580
so that our networks
are not caught off guard

984
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,049
or further perpetrated.

985
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:56,870
- Great, thank you for summarizing
that balanced approach.

986
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,940
And I think you're absolutely
right when you look

987
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,540
at the new executive order

988
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,680
and the emphasis on public-private
sector sharing again,

989
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,379
but also increased reporting
and increased reporting

990
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,840
to multiple agencies that certainly

991
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,340
is indicative of the importance
the government believes

992
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,950
of receiving that information timely.

993
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,060
- Kimberly, let me jump in
- Yeah.

994
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:24,640
- On that last point that I
think there's a nuance there

995
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,580
and I wanna make sure
everyone understands it.

996
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,580
So for some number of years now,

997
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,580
cyber incident reporting has been an issue

998
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,173
not here in the US, it's
been predominantly in the EU,

999
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,100
and it's the idea that if
you have a cyber incident

1000
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,660
and depending on the country

1001
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,069
and depending on some definitional issues,

1002
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,630
you may or may not have to,
but at the end of the day,

1003
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,850
there are certain entities that have

1004
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,120
to report cyber incidents, oftentimes,

1005
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,569
there are critical infrastructure
or they're telecom based

1006
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,630
or they're in some other sector,

1007
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,825
but this type of reporting
that we're talking about now,

1008
00:53:13,825 --> 00:53:18,825
is not the same as the laws that you have

1009
00:53:20,941 --> 00:53:24,319
in the 50 states for data breaches.

1010
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,710
So data breaches as
everyone knows are focused

1011
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,870
on personal information and
some other, in certain states,

1012
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:35,210
different types of
information about people.

1013
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,020
This notion that we're talking about now,

1014
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,730
cyber incident reporting,
is focused on exactly that,

1015
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,920
reporting of cyber incidents
from a cyber perspective

1016
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,130
as opposed to a personal
information perspective

1017
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,253
which is a pretty big policy change,

1018
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,950
but I do think given all
that we've talked about

1019
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:57,689
and given this notion
of a collective defense,

1020
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,690
it's that kind of information
sharing amongst entities

1021
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,360
and with the government,
that is going to lead

1022
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,010
to some of the effects
that we talked about.

1023
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,570
So I just wanted to clarify
so everyone understands

1024
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,880
what we're talking
about when we're talking

1025
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,343
about cyber incident report,

1026
00:54:15,703 --> 00:54:17,453
mandatory cyber incident reporting.

1027
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,750
- Yeah, no, it's important.

1028
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,960
Of course we have a little bit of that,

1029
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,790
right in the insurance industry with

1030
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:29,031
the NAIC model law and DFS,
and pre-licensed entities

1031
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:33,240
the material standard though,
for cyber security incidents.

1032
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,810
And we saw that right with the
banking agencies a proposal,

1033
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:42,299
to include a requirement for
reporting cyber incidents,

1034
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,780
but you're absolutely right.

1035
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,850
Very, very different
than the data breaches

1036
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,759
that we mandate reporting here in the US

1037
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,275
in contrast to other countries

1038
00:54:50,275 --> 00:54:53,650
that do have the NIS
directive and others so,

1039
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,920
very important distinction.

1040
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,020
- I think that this is
an area that is right

1041
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,020
for additional support, both
at an organizational level

1042
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,830
and at an individual entity level.

1043
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,090
I think that as private organizations

1044
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:14,090
are becoming increasing
targets of cyber events,

1045
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,010
there is going to be a
greater concern among them

1046
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,420
and that they're all no
way that that could kind

1047
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,620
of leverage their ability to respond

1048
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,470
is through collective action.

1049
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,080
And so I think you're going
to see a greater sharing

1050
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,330
of information hopefully.

1051
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,270
- Be optimist, right, so.

1052
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:39,558
And Shane, you wanna give
us your thoughts next.

1053
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:42,210
- We being the cyber security community,

1054
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,320
the legal community, the
policy community have for,

1055
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,230
it seems like forever,

1056
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,230
been trying to convince the government

1057
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,750
and different components of the government

1058
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,070
to share information with,

1059
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,440
to bolster the partnerships
with private industry

1060
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,910
because this can't be done
without that happening.

1061
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,450
With virtually every executive order

1062
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:10,450
I see every cyber security
bill I see introduced

1063
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,810
that is acknowledged.

1064
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,180
It's acknowledged also executive branch,

1065
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,940
legislative branch, we've acknowledged it

1066
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,973
that we need to have this partnership.

1067
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,160
That there needs to be more cooperation

1068
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,270
and that the country will be better off

1069
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,770
if we do that and it
seems to never happen.

1070
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:33,900
It's been a very frustrating
process for those

1071
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,350
of us that have been
very involved with it.

1072
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:40,640
I think it, I'm glad that
all sides definitely seem

1073
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,060
to see the benefits of
it of that cooperation,

1074
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,491
but I am not terribly optimistic

1075
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:50,750
that it's gonna happen in the short term.

1076
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,350
- There is a question of
whether we have metrics

1077
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:57,450
to help evaluate whether
we are making progress

1078
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,470
towards better coordination,

1079
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,209
coordinating activities between the public

1080
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,923
and private sectors on
Active Cyber response.

1081
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:06,943
- Great question.

1082
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:10,430
I am not aware of anything.

1083
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:15,370
I mean, we've got the STIX TAXII approach.

1084
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,950
Andrew kind of alluded to the fact

1085
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,660
that there are, there have
been attempts at this.

1086
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,170
They haven't necessarily been successful.

1087
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,790
I don't know if we got much
information out of those efforts

1088
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,723
but I do think it's
something that is needed,

1089
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:37,220
and it is something we
had, some of us had done

1090
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,980
some work with the US Chamber of Commerce

1091
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,800
on cyber incident reporting

1092
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,140
and one of the issues was metrics.

1093
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,450
And how do we measure
what's good, what's bad,

1094
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,270
what's improving, what's
helping, et cetera.

1095
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:55,420
So I'll use that to sort of segue

1096
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,770
into my response to the earlier question.

1097
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,053
I was gonna say, either glass half full,

1098
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,259
I'm hopeful, it seems like
there's enough momentum.

1099
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,500
I share Shane's concern.

1100
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,860
So I'm kinda between on my screen,

1101
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,550
Andrew's over here and Shane's over here,

1102
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,930
I'm kind of in between them in terms

1103
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,319
of where I think this will go.

1104
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,690
I think there's enough
people talking about it.

1105
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,710
I think, I believe the
message has gotten through

1106
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:28,890
to the government that we
need more timely information

1107
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,423
we're operating at
network speed essentially,

1108
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:38,680
but I'll also approach it with
two words, colonial pipeline.

1109
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,750
I saw a really interesting
piece just a couple of days ago

1110
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,970
about how, it wasn't specifically talking

1111
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,259
about defense forward, but
it was talking essentially

1112
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,640
about this whole of nation
approach to cyber defense

1113
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,680
and up until the colonial pipeline,

1114
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,410
the majority of people, unless
you're in certain industries,

1115
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,810
or focused on certain technologies,

1116
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,360
people just don't get it.

1117
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,510
- I just, I wanna thank all three of you.

1118
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,693
Great lively discussion today.
