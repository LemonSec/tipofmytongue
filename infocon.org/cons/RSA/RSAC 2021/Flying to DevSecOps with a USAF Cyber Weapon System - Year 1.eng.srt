1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,710
- Hi and welcome.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,800
I'm Dr. Mark Peters.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,510
I'm here today from Technica Corporation

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,990
with Flying to DevSecOps

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,650
with a US Air Force Cyber Weapon System

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,820
in our first year of operations.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,470
I'm the Lead IA/Security
Engineer for that corporation.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,140
You can find me on Twitter, @TinyCyber.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,590
I'm excited to be here
at the RSA conference.

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,630
And now I'm starting this out.

11
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,540
And as we said, we're flying to DevSecOps.

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,369
So flying to DevSecOps,
what we're talking about

13
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,850
is we're breaking up the same way

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,260
we look at a mission as a pilot,

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,718
or mission as a member of the Air Force.

16
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:33,840
In that way is that the Air
Force specializes in air power.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,958
And that culture that
you start dealing with,

18
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,100
specializes in delivering that airpower

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,610
at the right place at the right time.

20
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,080
This overall culture that
they have from the Air Force,

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,320
this overall influence
goes on to even influence

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,487
the way they do other things.

23
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,910
And the reason for that is
because the flying culture,

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,080
and I used to work for the Air Force,

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,400
and I worked with a
lot of flying squadrons

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,160
is just that these rules they have,

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,760
are rules written in blood.

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,860
And that meant that a rule was in place

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,960
because somebody had died to enforce it.

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,950
Something had happened tragically,

31
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,790
on the flying side of the world,

32
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,360
and the standards had
emerged to develop a pattern

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,370
that went through.

34
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,270
So things come down to
test, test and test again

35
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,619
to prevent any error.

36
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,150
And it's better to over test

37
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,230
and make sure that something is safe,

38
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,560
than to deliver something
that is not safe.

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,870
Well, that presents a challenge.

40
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,100
That presents a real challenge.

41
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,789
We talked about DevSecOps,

42
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,100
we talked about trying
to integrate security

43
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,530
into that overall mindset

44
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,060
and find a way to deal
with the cultural challenge

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,310
of making sure that it's safe

46
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,760
and those rules written in blood

47
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,250
and that waterfall mentality over done,

48
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,360
versus getting things out
to the customer sooner

49
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,623
in accelerating value.

50
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,280
So when we start of
our contract took over,

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,470
we took over about a year ago.

52
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,395
We took over November 2019.

53
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,179
So just before the pandemic.

54
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,110
Before all those things are going on.

55
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,400
We took over for a contract

56
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,080
as the Defensive
Applications Network Support.

57
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,913
Now what this was,

58
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:59,750
was this was contract to
support, maintain and operate

59
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,680
a defensive weapon system.

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,640
A weapon system known as CVAH,

61
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,770
Cyber Vulnerability Analysis and Hunt.

62
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,321
This was an (indistinct),

63
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,380
one where they would come
in with a secondary look

64
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,290
at those functions that were
actually going on in a network

65
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,140
that the network teams
on the Air Force bases

66
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,910
were capable or were prepared to do,

67
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,760
or a new set of tools that
they could even use to expand.

68
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,489
Now what you had initially
when we took over,

69
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,580
which had that they were looking

70
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,550
at the government
waterfall programs, right?

71
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,430
So you see that,

72
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,870
the simplified DoD acquisition
strategy there on the slide

73
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,860
that shows you a short way of
getting from place to place.

74
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,510
And you can see over emphasis
on admin and packaging

75
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,130
versus the functional delivery

76
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,510
that we really like to
talk about an agile.

77
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,959
The previous one had done sustainment

78
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,570
and maintenance and operations,

79
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,790
but they were all under
three separate contracts.

80
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,560
So we were moving those together

81
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,080
and we were moving to
DevSecOps at the same time,

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,510
trying to figure out how we
could make this transformation.

83
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,359
Some of those immediate
constraints we had,

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,137
is we had a constraint that

85
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,850
we were going to use the
Scaled Agile Framework

86
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,400
that was one the Air Force wanted to use,

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
and that was the one that
was developed for us.

88
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,890
Then we wanted to have
Teams for our Dev Teams,

89
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,899
our Ops Teams, or Security Teams,

90
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,680
our Integration Lab Teams,
and other Teams initially

91
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,750
and figure out how we needed
to put these Teams together

92
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,750
to best integrate the best move forward.

93
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,160
So after we've walked around the plane,

94
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,690
we've kind of checked out what's there,

95
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,650
we have to check the weather

96
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,127
because the things that are coming in,

97
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,530
that we don't know about.

98
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,490
The things that aren't really a part of

99
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,130
what that process is.

100
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,320
Well, one of the processes,

101
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,000
we didn't have any
standard infrastructure.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,370
None of those three previous contracts

103
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,140
have left anything that we
could really use or build from.

104
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,299
So we're gonna have to
build that on our own.

105
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,200
And that included the Dev environment.

106
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,083
How do we build that
selection of workplaces

107
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:46,230
of pipelines to bring the code together

108
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,760
and bring the code to check in
a way that we could integrate

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,399
as best as possible.

110
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,720
We didn't start out with
any physical workspaces.

111
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,060
We didn't start with integrating
any integrated security,

112
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,760
the security team piece was all new

113
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,030
moving from compliance
base to a security base.

114
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,340
A lot of the software wasn't finished.

115
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,810
They'd left it, they dumped it off,

116
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,090
and they moved from one
contract to another,

117
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,560
just like it happens.

118
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,320
They were in the middle
of that waterfall cycle

119
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,620
when they hit the end of
that they just move forward.

120
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,250
The documentation for that software,

121
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,860
because the software wasn't complete,

122
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,709
they were willing to do the
documentation at the end

123
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,239
and wasn't done either.

124
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,600
And then of course, like
you always see with DevOps,

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,780
as soon as we move to DevOps,

126
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,400
the customer says, you move
to DevOps, you move to Agile

127
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,885
that says you should deliver
every two weeks at the best

128
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:31,540
and at the worst you should
be delivering every month.

129
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,060
Because it's Agile, and
you have to deliver.

130
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,553
So all of our timelines got
accelerated along the way.

131
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,400
So check the weather, watch on the plane.

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,370
Now we're looking at the flight plan.

133
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,130
Get ready for the takeoff.

134
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,010
The first step, we had to do is,

135
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,260
we had to set out those visions,

136
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,560
those things that we wanted to do

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,300
that we thought we needed
to do in that first year

138
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,890
to move us forward.

139
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,123
We needed to close software
and documentation loopholes.

140
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:00,530
As some say, we needed to close
some of that (indistinct),

141
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,919
some of the things that were
half done, and half baked,

142
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
that were going forward.

143
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,270
We had an architecture,

144
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,950
we had a very high level
architecture as you can see,

145
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,500
that Interceptor Platform

146
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,910
that uses a Deployable Interceptor kit

147
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,510
that has systems and sensors,

148
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,510
that uses a interface for the user,

149
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,630
and then uses an in-garrison system.

150
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,710
And all these different
places and different tools

151
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,176
and different interactions
that had to get together.

152
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,110
We had to find out

153
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,570
how you get not just the
documentation together,

154
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,659
but the software together,

155
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,250
so that we could document appropriately.

156
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,980
We had to find a way to
innovate those things

157
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,420
to successful delivery,

158
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,070
to take the programs that we had,

159
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,159
to take the programs
that we put into place,

160
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
and find a way to link them together.

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
And of course, if we're doing DevOps,

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
we have to come up with a winning culture.

163
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,610
If we don't have a winning culture,

164
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,920
then we don't have anything that lasts,

165
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,983
we don't have anything to move us forward.

166
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,483
So as we started our flight,

167
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,430
the first thing that hit us,

168
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,140
the first thing was the clouds ahead.

169
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,460
We anticipated moving into
a new building right away.

170
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580
And this may not seem
like a security issue,

171
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,349
but it is from the sense
of having the network

172
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,520
and having the place,

173
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,546
where all your tools
are accessible to you.

174
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:07,610
You have a way that you can
communicate with other folks.

175
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,941
And because of the place we moved into

176
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:13,183
the lease, and the landlord,

177
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,099
and the furniture,

178
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,780
wasn't immediately available right away.

179
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,309
So that's immediate stop,

180
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,380
moving through three
temporary sites along the way,

181
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,610
before finishing in that
nicely, the picture building

182
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,500
you see over on the right.

183
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,580
And then of course,

184
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,400
had to be able to move from
a Dev controlled environment

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,099
to a continuous infrastructure.

186
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,330
What we had before was that

187
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,599
when the Dev's needed environment,

188
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,030
they spun up their own environment.

189
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,190
They spun up their own infrastructure.

190
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,700
And there wasn't any central
security architecture

191
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,420
that was linking those things together.

192
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,100
They didn't even know
what the architecture was,

193
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,960
all they knew was that they
were spinning up the environment

194
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,390
for their own pieces and make it forward.

195
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,390
So we needed to find a way to
blend those pieces together

196
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,250
to get infrastructures code,

197
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,410
to get common infrastructures code,

198
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,740
so that we're delivering the
same virtual environment,

199
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,770
so that we could get to
this off that weapon system

200
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,423
and deliver the same
physical environment as well.

201
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,520
So the lessons from those clouds,

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,299
it had to be able to
match requirement to need.

203
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,720
The main reason to go back and forth

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,060
between two different physical sites,

205
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,710
or three different physical sites,

206
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,380
which we weren't sure what
the requirements were,

207
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,990
as we were growing quickly in
those first couple of days.

208
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,610
We knew that we needed a couple teams,

209
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,540
we weren't sure how many
people we needed on the teams

210
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,170
or even the common areas where
those teams would interact.

211
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,090
We had a tool, we use DI2E to match up.

212
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,739
But we weren't sure of how
to get those pieces together

213
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,880
in the physical environment

214
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,350
to match the virtual environment.

215
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,790
So we did our team building
across multiple sites.

216
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,930
And we managed to do that

217
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,273
through linking with the
networking, with the connections,

218
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,097
with the Zoom, and the Teams,

219
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,246
and the other functions that went through.

220
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,520
And we made sure that a virtual presence,

221
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,419
although not equal to virtual presence,

222
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,250
connected everyone on the team.

223
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,000
And then we managed to share the security

224
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,980
and managed to share the
integrations as we went forward

225
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,740
into that final location,
to that final spot,

226
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,590
where we could put our lab
and we could put our instance.

227
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,969
So in putting the lab together,

228
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,470
we have to test the switches, right?

229
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,510
We have to make sure
that everything works,

230
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,343
as we're flying.

231
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,810
We have to make sure
that we keep it together.

232
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,940
We already mentioned that
we had a varied baseline.

233
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,219
We didn't have things together

234
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,250
and because they were done differently,

235
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,260
each piece was submitted as it was done,

236
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,250
instead of submitted as part of the whole.

237
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,562
So you're never quite sure

238
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,770
what the backwards integration was,

239
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,180
which meant that you had
a real gap in the security

240
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,790
of that existing platform.

241
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,800
Because the pieces didn't
fit together smoothly,

242
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,280
and they didn't integrate smoothly.

243
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,636
So we had to make sure that as we did that

244
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:38,219
we get to operational
tests to integrate a test.

245
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,070
And we developed the test
method or a test set of branches

246
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,940
for all these different
languages we were using

247
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,390
and all these different programs,

248
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,449
that we could automate
through those functions,

249
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,840
that we could do the unit testing

250
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,210
and the static code analysis.

251
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,850
And we moved up through the branches,

252
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,620
we did more and more testing.

253
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,460
And those test reports come back.

254
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,260
And as those test reports come back,

255
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,640
each set of individuals
get to look at those tests.

256
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,670
And they match those tests
that were coming forward

257
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,209
to the known baseline, to the known good.

258
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,870
So that we know what was out there.

259
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,790
And we kept those things
that were out there.

260
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,310
And then as we did those,

261
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,959
as the developers wrote code,

262
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,770
we said, hey, not only
should you write the code,

263
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,819
but you should develop the documentation.

264
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,470
You should draft the initial
sets of documentation

265
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,303
that are out there.

266
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,910
And you need to find a way to communicate

267
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,122
what it is you're doing and
how it is you're doing it,

268
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,630
so that we get it together

269
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,980
that each team has a responsibility
for the documentation

270
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,993
to the broader team.

271
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,969
So what do we find if the
switches were failing?

272
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,410
We found a way around those switches.

273
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,800
We found that having some
tech writers in place

274
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,150
helped greatly.

275
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,540
Having someone with some experience,

276
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,410
got the documentation together

277
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,870
and got the documentation
together effectively.

278
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,080
And as a security team,

279
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,540
we worked with those tech writers

280
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,260
to make sure that we understood
what the documentation was.

281
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,530
So not only was the
documentation good for the code

282
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,030
and good for the execution,

283
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,850
but the documentation we had,

284
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,760
was being used by our
security to support our audit

285
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,370
and to support our functions accumulator,

286
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,950
and support, since it was
an Air Force document,

287
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,203
or authority to operate.

288
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,410
At the same time as we were doing that,

289
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,699
straightening out the documentation,

290
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
we were also refactoring the code base.

291
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,733
We were doing things

292
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,959
that were not immediately
feature deliverable.

293
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
But we were working the code together,

294
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,230
we were pulling the
different pieces together,

295
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,340
so that we can make those
connections in the future.

296
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,940
That each step got more and
more secure as it went forward.

297
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,870
As an example, some of the audit functions

298
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,300
on the earlier versions of
the program were turned off.

299
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,560
They were disabled entirely,

300
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,750
and they weren't even
included in the delivery.

301
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,150
So we got to functions like Winlogbeats,

302
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,520
then putting those functions in

303
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,353
and making sure that

304
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,550
they automatically turned
on with the install

305
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,870
that the Ansible, the other
functions were kicking them off,

306
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,740
and then producing the logs that went back

307
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,590
so that we could check on those
things on a regular basis.

308
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,210
And so that we had a way to communicate

309
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,260
between the different functions.

310
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,600
We also found a way to
coordinate the resources

311
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,370
by the different development teams.

312
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,940
With that virtual lab
that we had standing up,

313
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,340
they stood up a different
instance for Dev,

314
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,810
and they stood up an instance for code,

315
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,140
and they stood up an instance
for our tech writers,

316
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,199
So the tech writers can even kick off

317
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,440
in (indistinct) of the program

318
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,790
and test to make sure that
the documentation they had,

319
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,610
that they helped with was
still completely appropriate

320
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,000
as we move forward.

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,620
And that every team that was kicking off

322
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,250
had the same infrastructure.

323
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,950
They had that same
infrastructure to kick off

324
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,490
for all three sections of CVAH program,

325
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,290
and they run it, and they run
it, and they run it virtually,

326
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,310
and they run it virtually
for all three systems

327
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,239
and then they could run
it on the actual hardware

328
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
of all three systems without
ever leaving the lab.

329
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,510
And they could schedule
that through a calendar

330
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,170
that we had across our small team.

331
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,010
And I keep saying small team,

332
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,819
and we have less than 100.

333
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,290
We probably had less than 50

334
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
for the first six to nine months

335
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,600
of people going forward
between all the Dev Teams

336
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,640
and all the administration

337
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,253
everybody else (indistinct)
system forward.

338
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,920
So as we move forward from
those initial implementations,

339
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,310
we talked about compliance.

340
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,920
Talked about where's the chart?

341
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
Where's the map?

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,420
Well, we all know, the federal government

343
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,939
has heavy, heavy compliance.

344
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,790
And that they need a
lot that paperwork done.

345
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,040
As matter of fact, the
system that we inherited,

346
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,089
on their previous authority to operate

347
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,890
had over 900 open plans
of actions and milestones

348
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,240
that they needed to solve to move forward.

349
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,340
They needed all those things (indistinct)

350
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,490
they need all those
things with the response,

351
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,053
and they all those things
tied tightly together.

352
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,850
And they all required paperwork,

353
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,360
because it's the government,
the Federal government.

354
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,730
Not only what they like the paperwork,

355
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,980
but they'd like it to be continuous.

356
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,090
They'd like it to be every
time that you go out there

357
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,300
you submitted it remains the same,

358
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,300
that you'd be able to fold
those things together.

359
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,380
In which we had to find a
way to fold out on our own,

360
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,420
a folding compliance and agile together.

361
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,280
How do we keep our team agile

362
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,267
as we move forward.

363
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,210
And we're still looking at
things like the regulations

364
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,210
that we had to meet.

365
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
The different Air Force standards

366
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,666
for what they needed for security,

367
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,310
and what they were responsible for.

368
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,160
And not just the security
of the development,

369
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,380
but the operational
security of the program,

370
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,220
of knowing that one of the
Air Force teams comes out

371
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,870
finds a common vulnerability

372
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,210
and they bring that vulnerability back

373
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,260
and says go through and check
and make sure where it is.

374
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,270
And then this standards,

375
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,829
the 853,

376
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,740
are the governance at the same
time with the transparency,

377
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,210
making sure we were doing
all the right things,

378
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,383
to move forward and keep ourself
together with those things.

379
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,850
Then we learn lessons
about folding the maps,

380
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,260
and then we learned
some really good lessons

381
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,093
about folding maps,

382
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:32,290
especially from a security standpoint.

383
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,660
We found out we really needed
to integrate the security

384
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,733
into the teams.

385
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,170
Our security in the past
had been compliance based.

386
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,270
And you had found somebody

387
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,810
who is gonna code 10 or 15 years ago,

388
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,780
and you had taken them

389
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,370
and move them into the compliance section

390
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,940
to work in the security
paperwork for the government.

391
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,800
and left them out of the piece

392
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,099
where they needed to fall back

393
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,400
really understand the code
from the DevSecOps standpoint.

394
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,430
So we rolled that back the other way.

395
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,069
We made sure that we started
our team on a combat port

396
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,720
and using as a system of flowing

397
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,490
from one to the other to the other,

398
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,540
and keeping our security policy

399
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,110
and our security integrations
in a common place

400
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,297
where there was transparency
for everyone to see.

401
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:14,270
But there was transparency

402
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,617
for all the developers to go through

403
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:18,050
and see exactly what it
was we were working on.

404
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,890
And not only did we do that,

405
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,290
but we made sure even for our small team,

406
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,180
we had one security individual

407
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,479
for each of the teams
that we had out there.

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,637
So we assigned one of those
folks to each of the teams.

409
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:31,237
And we made sure that we
went out there to the teams

410
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,230
and we were present in
their daily stand ups

411
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,710
and we were present in
their daily meetings

412
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,089
on a day to day basis.

413
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,070
And we talked to them about security,

414
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,070
we talked to them about the stakes,

415
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,217
the secure technical
implementation guides,

416
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,920
and what we needed, and why we needed,

417
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,429
what the application was,

418
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,077
and how we integrated those
pieces to go together.

419
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,810
And so in order to do that,

420
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,359
we also had to establish
continuous monitoring.

421
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,620
And we continuously monitored

422
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,650
what was going on by being present.

423
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,130
And by being present
not just in their teams

424
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,450
but on their boards,

425
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,490
and on their boards that
functions that went forward.

426
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,630
So that we could develop security,

427
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,520
and that we could get to a good answer.

428
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,740
And in the end, you know what,

429
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,150
we closed over 900 of those points.

430
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,030
We had 47 left when we submitted

431
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,439
out of over a thousand we started with.

432
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,773
We were approved
(indistinct) over two years.

433
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,390
So that brings us to
how did it really work

434
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,040
if we did these things and we
made these lessons forward?

435
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,860
What does it really look like?

436
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,260
Well, in order to have the comparison,

437
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,930
because we talked about
having the baseline

438
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,349
for a risk comparison and
for a security comparison

439
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,530
as you move forward.

440
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,703
You have to have the baseline
for what had happened before.

441
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,740
So the CVAH system, is
a quick bit of history.

442
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,830
It was initially released in 2013.

443
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,540
And it was designated as a weapon system,

444
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,699
which sounds like a very neat thing.

445
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,590
But in the Air Force,

446
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,720
what the weapon system means is

447
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,670
it draws a line around that budget system.

448
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,219
And that everything that goes with it

449
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,250
falls under that central
budget designation,

450
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,240
whether it's training,
whether it's sustainment,

451
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,530
whatever it is, it falls under that.

452
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,110
So we fall forward under the same line.

453
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,473
And we all are able to
manage a common baseline.

454
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,849
So it was released and they
did a quick version update

455
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,470
as soon as they released it.

456
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,940
Quick two and a half years later,

457
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,263
from April 2013 to October 2015.

458
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,050
In December of 2016,

459
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,750
they released a version 2.0,

460
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,870
which came after the
January, oh, I'm sorry,

461
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,810
I went too far forward.

462
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,099
In January of 2016,

463
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,670
it was transitioned to the PMO,

464
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,400
the Program Management Office,

465
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,110
someone at the government and
Lifecycle Management Center

466
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,600
who would own it and own
the program going together.

467
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,630
And then in December of 2016,

468
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,850
they managed to release version 2.0.

469
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:47,970
Then 15 months later,

470
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,470
they came up with version 3.0.

471
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,310
And after that, there is nothing.

472
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,733
We took over as I said,

473
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,790
in November of 2019.

474
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,170
They said that 3.1.2 was released,

475
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,670
but there were competing customization.

476
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,339
So they didn't release just one version,

477
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,040
they released multiple versions.

478
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,899
And if you've ever worked

479
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,930
with configure against multiple versions,

480
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,020
you know how difficult
that is to baseline,

481
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,819
you need to know the
challenges and the headaches

482
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,399
that can pose from a security perspective.

483
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,040
So when we took over 2019,

484
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,802
we released the first
3.2.1 release in 2020.

485
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,579
And then in, or January of 2020.

486
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,780
Then in June, we did version 3.3,

487
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,930
and October we did 3.4,

488
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:33,209
and in January, we did 3.5.

489
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,040
Just got that one out the door.

490
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,320
So we're on track to
release every couple months,

491
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,620
every three months.

492
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,550
Which is once a quarter,

493
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,590
which doesn't seem a lot
from a DevOps perspective,

494
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,501
if you go back to accelerate
by Nicole Forsgren, here,

495
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:47,910
mature teams release several times a day.

496
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,910
But on the government side

497
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,160
to release into maintain compliance

498
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,403
four times a year, it's pretty good.

499
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,193
So what do we do?

500
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:57,062
What do we find some of these things

501
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,840
that we circle the field
and look at what we did?

502
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,679
What were the things we
inherited that really stand out?

503
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,200
Well, there is some cultural debt?

504
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
There are some process of
inheriting the waterfall

505
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,847
and inheriting the previous contract.

506
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,600
And you can't complain about it too much.

507
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,230
Because every team has to self organize

508
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,980
and has to be able to build
their own type of structure.

509
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,439
So those changing leadership
structures were advocated.

510
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,600
We talked about it a lot.

511
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,540
We did a lot of the self
organized (indistinct),

512
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,030
we did a lot of the supporting
the teams moving forward

513
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,930
to figure out exactly

514
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,030
what the best leadership structure was.

515
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,800
And we had individuals that
were in each of the sections.

516
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,399
We had a leader from a dancer,

517
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,650
we tried to mirror the the program side.

518
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,700
We had a lead engineer,

519
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,833
we had a lead in charge of the lab

520
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,210
and the integration lab.

521
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,484
We had an architect,

522
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,350
we had myself as a security individual,

523
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,570
we had a program manager,

524
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,730
and we had a logistics individual,

525
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,800
who made sure that all the pieces

526
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,633
got where they were supposed to

527
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,500
since we were shipping hardware.

528
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,250
We made sure that we got
together a couple times a week

529
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,840
to sit down and talk about the functions

530
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,040
to manage the functions
all the way through.

531
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,090
We had our Dev Teams,

532
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,429
we had our four development
teams doing development,

533
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,750
working in functions
or three to start with,

534
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,240
with an engineering and architecture team.

535
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,840
Each of those running
10 to 15 individuals.

536
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,919
We had our security team,

537
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,810
which was four individuals.

538
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,762
Then we had our Ops Team

539
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:22,460
(indistinct) at the site,

540
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,540
tier one, tier two, maintenance,

541
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,550
and then sent the tier three

542
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,520
maintenance back to
the development center.

543
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,600
So we had each of those
functions move forward.

544
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,582
And one of the cultural debt things

545
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,450
that we struggled with thought
of that was who runs whom?

546
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,050
Which portion of which
section went forward,

547
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,710
in which portion of which section

548
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,120
was most important for (indistinct).

549
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,780
We found that it was
different on a daily basis.

550
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,760
You couldn't set something

551
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,870
and say the program
manager is set the guidance

552
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,005
or the engineer gets to set the guidance

553
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,450
because a lot of it vary
based on what we're answering

554
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,960
and what the practices were,
and what the products were,

555
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,913
as we move forward.

556
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,280
We move from just the
cultural debt to process debt.

557
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,810
What were the processes we inherited?

558
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,120
Well, we already mentioned
about the customer timelines.

559
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,402
The customer wanted to go faster,

560
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:09,460
and they needed to go faster.

561
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,830
And we wanted delivering
on to going faster.

562
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,220
But that didn't mean that their processes

563
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
still weren't tied
tightly to that waterfall.

564
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,160
A lot of those processes are still tied,

565
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,030
in that DoD acquisition framework.

566
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,960
Despite the fact that you see them,

567
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,027
you have to work to make things faster.

568
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,410
As an example,

569
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,360
one of the requirements for the ATO

570
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,330
is that it asked for
risk assessment guidance,

571
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,740
it asked for a separate
document in an Excel spreadsheet

572
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,240
that goes through and
defines each level of risk,

573
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,430
each separate level of
risk all the way through.

574
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,920
Well, this is after you've
submitted a 1200 page document

575
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,110
that explains for each in this control,

576
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,080
where you're at, what the
policy is that applies to it,

577
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,919
and what the next policy is.

578
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,560
So we went back to our
headquarters and we said,

579
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,120
hey, we don't really need
to do the risk assessment,

580
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,010
because we've done 1200
pages of risk assessment.

581
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,220
So to redo it, and
recompile it in this manner

582
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,160
it's really a process issue.

583
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,250
And they agreed with us.

584
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,470
And they let us keep
where we had, move ahead

585
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,470
without dealing with that process issue.

586
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,410
And we had to organize the teams,

587
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,520
because we couldn't
just organize the teams

588
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,820
the way that they were before.

589
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,169
And we can organize the teams

590
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,360
the way the government was used to,

591
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,090
even though they had the most experience

592
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,072
because it hadn't worked before.

593
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:26,570
And to keep doing something
that hasn't succeeded,

594
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,169
I've heard several times it's
a definition of insanity,

595
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,830
to keep doing something the same way

596
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,770
and expect a different result.

597
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,520
So we organized our teams differently.

598
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,490
We built our teams differently.

599
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,880
And we made sure

600
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,370
that we scattered some of
those people who transitioned

601
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,760
from the previous contract,

602
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,660
so that they could get
the broader experience

603
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,550
of what was going on.

604
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,000
The broader functionality
of how we move forward.

605
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,690
We did have some technical debt as well.

606
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,523
As we mentioned,

607
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:54,730
there were things that
were in previous code

608
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,290
or previous instances.

609
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,320
One of the first and the
biggest instances we found

610
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,250
is move forward,

611
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,930
which we moved from Jenkins to Gitlab.

612
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,600
Jenkins was nice,

613
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,070
but it wasn't doing everything we needed

614
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,300
from a continuous integration,

615
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,080
continuous deployment pipeline.

616
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,750
So we went to one of those basic versions

617
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,490
of Gitlab that we had out
there, we deployed it forward.

618
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,220
I have to tell you as a security
guy when we moved Gitlab,

619
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,190
I went back to my guys
a couple weeks later,

620
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,030
and I said, hey, we've gone
to Gitlab, that's great,

621
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,460
they've all these great
new security dashboards.

622
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,570
And I'm really excited about

623
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,110
getting used to security dashboards

624
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,639
and tracking those metrics,

625
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,740
and figuring out how we can
get those tools in place.

626
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,530
(indistinct) we didn't buy that first,

627
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,940
we did turn that on.

628
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,820
So there's communication
between the teams.

629
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,040
But we found a way around it.

630
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,980
Well, the way we found around it was

631
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,590
we found a way to actually
get into logs from the runners

632
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,439
and be able to look at the security

633
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,450
and get individuals on the teams

634
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,220
familiar with what we
had as a baseline scan,

635
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,740
versus the scans and the logs

636
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,040
that were playing in that runner

637
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,010
so that they could compare the two,

638
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,200
so that they had a visibility
of what was going on.

639
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,880
We use those dashboards
to create transparency.

640
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
The fact that anyone
could get into the Gitlab,

641
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,610
the fact that anyone could
get into the ACAS scanner

642
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,319
from tenable that we're using
to run our security scans,

643
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,860
and look at the raw scan
as well as the other scan

644
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,860
created that transparency across the port.

645
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,250
And not just the raw scan,

646
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,950
but we also posted those
scans on a regular basis.

647
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,710
And we took those scans that we had

648
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,590
those security items

649
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,070
and we brought them back
to the teams and said, hey,

650
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,600
this is what we have, this
is what we're working with.

651
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,340
And that holds true for both the static

652
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,449
and the dynamic scans,

653
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,030
with the static and looking at the code

654
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,639
and looking at the best code,

655
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,200
how we were using SonarQube.

656
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,170
And a lot of those metrics

657
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,201
were getting reported out at
the team level on daily basis

658
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:42,380
as they were putting things forward,

659
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,700
as they were doing their commits.

660
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,650
We were talking about what their code was,

661
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,150
and what their successes were.

662
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,892
So that we can move forward
and ensure security forever.

663
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,459
So what do we do, if
we're down on the ground

664
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,500
and our flights completely moved forward

665
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,330
as we look back.

666
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,860
We had four releases in 12 months.

667
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,929
Now that's exceptional from
a government's standpoint.

668
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,620
The government says, they wanna have,

669
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,909
like I said that waterfall on
a three to five years good.

670
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,860
Heck, even the rapid acquisition
program for the government

671
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,179
when they assigned someone to figure out

672
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,170
a new, faster way of doing things,

673
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,970
the team to design the rapid program

674
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,660
took three years looking at it,

675
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,310
before they released their initial report

676
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,830
of how long it was gonna take
to institute a wrap program

677
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,509
to move things faster.

678
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:28,660
So to be able to get four
releases out to the customer

679
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,400
with new features,

680
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,070
bringing in some of the
Kubernetes based systems,

681
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,010
bringing in more options,

682
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,280
moving from Windows

683
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,230
2012 to 2019 on the server base,

684
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,786
getting rid of some of those
inherent vulnerabilities.

685
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:47,200
That was great for our team.

686
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,033
Then as I mentioned,

687
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,139
we are compliant with the
standards at NIST 800-53.

688
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,950
We went through all those controls.

689
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,810
And what's even better,

690
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,409
because our security teams were integrated

691
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,383
with the day to day,

692
00:24:57,383 --> 00:24:59,610
when it came time to write in the ATO,

693
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,229
we know where the evidence was.

694
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,560
And even though we had to
move from system to system,

695
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,240
instead of dragging somebody else down,

696
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,250
to ask for something and not
getting the right product,

697
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,680
and going back and asking again

698
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,110
and not getting the right product,

699
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,800
we knew it was ourselves.

700
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,720
When it came time to clip
how we were doing something

701
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,010
when it came time to talk about
two factor authentication,

702
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,530
and where the two factor was,
and how it was installed,

703
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,300
and how it was used, where
the configuration was,

704
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,511
and where that Winlogbeats file went.

705
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:28,830
We had that all as a security team,

706
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,290
because we had dug into the
code, and dug into the Gitlab

707
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,280
to make sure that we
had the right features.

708
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,649
We moved to a new build, that seems small,

709
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,080
but it changes everything.

710
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,860
And it changed access to the server.

711
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,030
Because as I mentioned,

712
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,507
not only did we have
access to the software

713
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,000
in the virtual environment,

714
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,450
but we needed to be able to construct

715
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,690
the physical environment.

716
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,180
And this gave access
to physical equipment.

717
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,850
The teams could go in and test on

718
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,592
and use it when they needed to.

719
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,260
And then we went from the three Dev Teams

720
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,670
and the engineering and architecture team

721
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,244
to a fourth Dev Team.

722
00:25:58,244 --> 00:25:59,750
(indistinct) features we were delivering

723
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,767
the customer said we wanna keep this up.

724
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,870
And in order to keep it up,

725
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,429
we think we need a forth Team.

726
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,643
We need more features delivered
in that rate and faster.

727
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,440
So where does that get us?

728
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,640
Where do we go from there?

729
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,473
Once we shut down the engine,

730
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:16,260
and what are kind of those
lessons learned that we have?

731
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,640
Well, we like continuous monitoring.

732
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,820
But we need more continuous monitoring.

733
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,850
We need that monitoring

734
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,260
to get to more of a continuous ATO.

735
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,930
As an off net function,

736
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,840
we don't link everything together today.

737
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,679
So while everyone is going cloud based,

738
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,020
ours is going to more off
(indistinct) and more centric.

739
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,237
But we're looking to alleviate that,

740
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:35,030
and we're looking to alleviate that

741
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,379
through some hybrid cloud enactments,

742
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,310
from using some control
functions to go through,

743
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,842
to using some controlled standards,

744
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,110
to build across and make the functions

745
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,160
so that we can get to a continuous ATO.

746
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,620
And a continuous ATO,

747
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,959
means that we always have
the authority to operate.

748
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,410
That we always have the
authority to go forward

749
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,373
and be checked

750
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,710
by delivering our continuous
monitoring solution

751
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,347
into a pre prepared (indistinct).

752
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,420
We'd like to use some AI, some ML agents

753
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,157
to improve our pipelines, to
set those metrics in place,

754
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,520
and have the observation of those metrics,

755
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,420
and the integration of those metrics,

756
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,930
to both speed and accelerate our ability

757
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,400
to release on demand.

758
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,850
Of course release on demand
ties back to our cloud solutions

759
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,209
so we need to go to some
type of cloud solution

760
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,720
to be able to move that forward.

761
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,340
And we've been working
on that integrating that

762
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,389
so we get those pieces tied together.

763
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,423
And that we can have a secure
cloud solution moving forward.

764
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,490
What were the ultimate lessons here?

765
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,560
You have to practice.

766
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,220
We had to practice every day.

767
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,740
You have to do it over and over and over.

768
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,750
Malcolm Gladwell talks
about perfect practice.

769
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,260
It's not practice that makes perfect,

770
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,110
it's perfect practice makes perfect.

771
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,376
And to get familiarity with something

772
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:55,520
you have to do it 500 times.

773
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,550
And to become proficient,

774
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,810
you have to do it 5000 times.

775
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,110
And we found the same thing.

776
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,679
You have to practice
over over and over again.

777
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,350
And you have to practice
whether it's the integration,

778
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,169
or the local teams, or the local factors,

779
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,860
that drive you to that function.

780
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,149
And the best way to get there,

781
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,720
even when you're
practicing is transparency.

782
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,400
Being able to look at what
the other teams are doing,

783
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,580
being able to see everything
and have it all out there.

784
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,899
Now that open kimono approach

785
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,620
is kind of frowned upon a lot of times,

786
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,550
especially in government.

787
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,950
Because they don't wanna show
everyone else what's going on.

788
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,260
They don't want everyone to
know what the process is,

789
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,870
or know how they're moving it forward.

790
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,350
But that transparency drives success.

791
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,629
And it happens through
setting clear goals.

792
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,970
And the clear goals that
we set as we move forward,

793
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,020
as we learn from those initial goals,

794
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,400
is to accelerate the value of delivery,

795
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,413
is to accelerate the way forward,

796
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,760
to try to drive a quarterly
release for on prem solution,

797
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
have a rapid maintenance response.

798
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
We have those teams on site

799
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,930
and we deliver those
teams to move forward,

800
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,500
to help out with what's there
at tier one and tier two,

801
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,200
and then move to tier three
back to the developer level.

802
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
To secure test integration,

803
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,660
like we did on that earlier slide,

804
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,560
where you have the test
you have the integration

805
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,460
at every step of the development chain.

806
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,700
And every step of that pipeline,

807
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,650
you're testing back,
testing back, testing back.

808
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,230
And then of course, continuous compliance,

809
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,817
because it is a security talk.

810
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:20,760
And (indistinct) compliance.

811
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,370
So we get to those functions.

812
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,169
And we set those clear goals.

813
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,007
And I really have to emphasize
that we set them again,

814
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:29,443
in order to move forward.

815
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:33,330
And finally, as we apply them
what can you do with this?

816
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,713
How can you take this away?

817
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,648
In the next week,

818
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,719
if you're thinking about
a DevSecOps transition,

819
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
you should analyze what
you intend to accomplish.

820
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,480
You should think about
what those goals are

821
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,280
and you should lay them out clearly.

822
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,100
As for the next 90 days,
as you move forward,

823
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,600
examine each iteration.

824
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,840
As you move to sprints

825
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,550
think carefully about
retrospective and review.

826
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,530
Make sure that you have
actionable reviews,

827
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,690
and that you're using
those to move forward

828
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,110
and your technical debt,
and your cultural debt,

829
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,560
and your process debt,

830
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,929
maybe even on people debt,

831
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,283
because we talk about
cultural process people.

832
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:07,630
And we talk about how those people

833
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,130
interact with those functions.

834
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,310
And then the next six months,

835
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,940
if you're still having success,

836
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,590
adjust to your new statuses,

837
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,679
make changes to achieve your goals.

838
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,950
You have to know that as you
move forward, it's small steps.

839
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,870
And even though it doesn't
seem like those small steps

840
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,850
are doing a lot,

841
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,270
when you make those small steps,

842
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,610
six months from now you'll look back

843
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,510
and you won't recognize where we started.

844
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,610
We never would have
thought over a year ago

845
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,219
that we would have an
integrated ATO compliant

846
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,690
and have delivered four times

847
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,910
and have these (indistinct)
lab set within a year,

848
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,863
and yet we did in the security world.

849
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,973
Thank you very much.

850
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:47,899
I enjoyed giving this talk.

851
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,690
I enjoyed the chance to be here
at the RSA Conference 2021,

852
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,453
talking about resilience and
talking about experiences.

853
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,776
Have a great day.
