00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,380
- Welcome to "MDR: Making
Sense of the Veg-O-Matic

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,090
Buzzword Blender."

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,870
My name is Diana Kelley
and I'm CTO and Co-Founder

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,180
at SecurityCurve.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,623
And co-presenting with me today is,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,180
- Lisa Lee and I'm from Microsoft.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,030
I'm the Chief Security Advisor

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,760
and work in our business development area

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,930
with our vertical industries.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,630
- Yes, and we both used to
work together at Microsoft

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,939
and did some work on
MDR while we were there.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,470
So this is, we want you to,
to know that we are here live

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,129
even though this is a recorded session.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,760
Lisa and I are here live today too

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,220
as you're listening, as
you're watching this.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,050
So please if you have questions,

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,989
just go ahead and enter
those into the chat.

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,428
And with that we're gonna get started.

19
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,510
(mouse clicking)

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,220
So Veg-O-Matic which, you
know I think of as a blender

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,170
I think it's actually
a chopper officially.

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,900
But you know, I think of it as
like bringing things together

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,460
sort of that like the Lucy show of just

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,890
bringing a bunch of stuff together

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,040
and I don't know about
you but I often feel

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,760
really overwhelmed by the
number of acronyms that come out

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,930
especially when there's a new area.

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,240
So you know, I felt like
I just had figured out

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,527
what MDR meant and suddenly
like people were saying,

30
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,680
"Well there's MXDR, we do MTDR."

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,730
And it's like, Oh my gosh.

32
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,250
So the whole reason that
we came up with this talk

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,920
was we thought it would
be a really good thing

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,540
to just walk through
the differences between

35
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,810
the kinds of offerings.

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,490
And to just really kind of normalize

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,830
some of the pros and cons
and choices and trade-offs

38
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,030
that you can make when you're deciding

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,860
if you need an MDR at all.

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,810
And if you do, what kind of MDR you want.

41
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,400
So we've spelled out
the different acronyms

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,730
on this next slide so
that you can see them

43
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,840
and know what they are.

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,900
You know there's Endpoint,
Network, Threat and eXtended,

45
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,520
the X is extended.

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,740
But, that doesn't always
help to really understand

47
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,699
what they mean.

48
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,030
So when you think about Managed Endpoint,

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,460
we've got some slides to give
you more visual view of this.

50
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,190
You think about Managed Endpoint, right?

51
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,023
What does that?

52
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:00,030
That really means the
endpoints themselves.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,750
So that would include your
laptops and your desktops.

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,780
It may include servers in some cases.

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,169
Definitely it's gonna
include your mobile devices

56
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,230
and your phones and your tablets.

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,040
So basically anything that's on the edge,

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,873
that's the endpoint.

59
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:15,959
When you're talking about

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,310
Managed Endpoint Detection and Response,

61
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,690
that means that it's gonna
cover both monitoring

62
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,640
what's happening or even
proactive threat hunting

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,570
on those different devices.

64
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,650
And then response, if anything goes wrong.

65
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,050
You got a piece of malware
on your, your endpoint

66
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,800
then the MEDR would kick in.

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,690
So as you hear these different acronyms,

68
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,380
what they really are
responding to or covering

69
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,370
is the kind of the scope of
what's in the management system.

70
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,940
So the next one is for networks.

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,670
And here you're definitely
gonna get servers

72
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,089
but you're also gonna
get the more traditional,

73
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,490
if you think about like an
MSSP or managed security,

74
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,820
very often you probably
go to thinking switches

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,970
and routers and firewalls.

76
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,340
And depending on what service you buy

77
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,770
and it's gonna depend
on what's right for you,

78
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,250
what that, that vendor offers.

79
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,110
But network now starts to bring in those,

80
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,100
those cases that are sort
of a traditional perimeter.

81
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,100
And now in the cloud, what
we've got with software defined

82
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,760
perimeter things like your,
your firewalls, your servers.

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,209
And those proportions of the
pieces of network security

84
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,680
could also include things
like your SOCK or your SIM,

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,400
what's within your SOCK.

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,650
And then the next one is MTDR,

87
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,430
which Lisa is gonna cover.

88
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,260
- Yeah, so MTDR meaning,

89
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,480
you know the Threat
Detection and Response.

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,910
This one focuses very
heavily on the threat signal.

91
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,829
And so it's kind of that idea,

92
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,540
you know one vendor talks about

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,750
correlating the different
threat signals to provide

94
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,710
an automated threat
detection and response.

95
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,270
So it's really focused
on the signal aspect of,

96
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,780
of what's happening and the, you know the,

97
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,913
the automation of that correlation.

98
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,579
Then we have,

99
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,690
- Yeah, when you bring it all
together you may hear MXDR.

100
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,040
So now that you're kind of,
you're catching on, right?

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
You've probably seen it now.

102
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,589
It's pretty clear that when
they change that second letter,

103
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,459
it tends to cover what's
gonna be part of the service.

104
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,380
And when you get MXDR or
Managed Extended Detection

105
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,530
and Response, most of
the time what that means

106
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,859
is that the vendor is gonna bring together

107
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,840
Endpoint Detection and Response

108
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,549
with Network Detection and Response.

109
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,610
And very often that threat
signal, threat intelligence

110
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,090
and be able to bring all
those together for a really

111
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,330
comprehensive Managed Detection
and Response solution.

112
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,030
And if you're thinking,
"Wow, do I even need to have

113
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,130
a security team?

114
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,900
Do I even need to have a
SOCK if I'm gonna have MXDR?"

115
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,909
Well, the answer is maybe not.

116
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,750
Most companies are still gonna need them

117
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,020
but some companies are looking
at, could MXDR be replacing?

118
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,993
Or if they don't, they
can't afford a SOCK,

119
00:04:56,993 --> 00:05:00,490
they may be looking at MXDR to
kind of cover a lot of that,

120
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,538
that use case.

121
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,870
(mouse clicking)

122
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,200
- So one of the things that we heard from

123
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,370
a chief security officer was
that they thought they had

124
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,740
bought an XDR solution.

125
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,670
They weren't looking for
the managed aspect of it,

126
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,040
but they they wanted to
augment their capabilities

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,270
and their team.

128
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,289
And what they ended up with
was really just an MSSP,

129
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,580
just a managed, really
alerting system or capability.

130
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,950
And so, you know when
that shiny pretty thing

131
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,430
kind of wears off, you
know did you really get

132
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,300
what you thought you got?

133
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,860
So in this case, maybe you
didn't get the flying car.

134
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,230
Maybe you just got the car
with a few wings and fins.

135
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,800
But you know it's, it's making
sure that you're really aware

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,880
of, of what you're buying.

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,350
And we did think that this,
you know Veg-O-Matic blender

138
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,770
was contributing a lot to
that because the terminology

139
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,440
is still so loose in some
cases or maybe just not

140
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,917
being applied in the right way.

141
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,369
So, you know just trying
to make sure that you,

142
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,966
you know the vendor or the buyer beware,

143
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:03,816
making sure that you're getting
what you intended to get.

144
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,940
- Yeah, just talking it
through your provider.

145
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,430
And this is, it happens
anytime that you get

146
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,790
a new set of offerings.

147
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,950
Very often other vendors
that have been in the space

148
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,800
for a while.

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,500
They start saying, "Well,
you know we have a lot

150
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,730
of that capability."

151
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,450
So they wanna offer it too.

152
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,180
And that's not to say
that an MSSP can't offer

153
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,480
a really strong MDR.

154
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,770
We're just saying, make
sure that you've asked about

155
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,546
what you're getting
because if they just say,

156
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:30,860
"Hey, we've got wings."

157
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,860
You may end up with a
car that actually flies

158
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,690
or you may end up with you
know, a cute looking car

159
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,630
but it's not gonna go anywhere.

160
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,909
It's kind of a penguin of a car.

161
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,630
So, it's really just
about asking the questions

162
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,130
and making sure you
know what you're buying.

163
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,540
And it really is best
for you to figure out

164
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,910
the questions in advance because

165
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,080
any vendor is really excited
about their solution.

166
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,280
So that old thing about you know,

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,969
if all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail

168
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,520
and that, that's gonna happen.

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,210
So be sure that you've thought
about what your company needs

170
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,940
and what you really want out of a service.

171
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,743
So at a very high level, and again, every

172
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:12,060
MDR are, the vendors have
different sets of capabilities

173
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,310
that they supply.

174
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,980
MSSPs are moving into this
space and some of them

175
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,831
are truly moving into the space
giving you the flying car.

176
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:22,560
Some are just not getting again
and have kind of the wings

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,510
on there, but not they don't fly.

178
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,610
So we're giving you some some
good top level things to ask

179
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,300
or to think about the differentiate

180
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
traditional MSSPs and MDR.

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,570
So the traditional MSSPs tend to be

182
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,349
a little bit more portal based.

183
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,330
So if you wanna talk to a person,

184
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,190
yeah maybe you can pick up the phone

185
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,940
but most of what's happened
is that they've got

186
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,773
this managed.

187
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:46,700
They're managing a lot of
different systems and devices

188
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,159
and your interaction with
the MSSP would be through

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,360
checking your, your
dashboard on the portal.

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,540
They often are very heavy and automation

191
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,430
in the managed service offering.

192
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,100
They will do monitoring but
they generally stop at alerting.

193
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,260
Again, I wanna be clear
that we're giving you

194
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,219
generalizations and you
have to ask these questions

195
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,110
to make sure what your vendor is offering.

196
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,140
But generally they stop at alerting

197
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,610
so you'll find out that
something's gone wrong

198
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,443
within the system.

199
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,560
You'll get an alert up on your dashboard

200
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,520
but that may be where things stop.

201
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,719
And very often if there is
remediation or tasks that

202
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,350
have to get, to get taken
when there has been a breach

203
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,320
or an incident has been identified,

204
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,233
then that escalates to the customer.

205
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,240
Which is a great offering

206
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,909
and that's what a lot of companies need.

207
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,799
That's why MSSPs have been so successful.

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,611
But, some companies are
looking for something

209
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:42,470
a little bit more proactive,
a little bit more hands-on.

210
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,140
And that's the niche that MDR is filling.

211
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Most MDR offerings have a
combination of human beings

212
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,940
with hands-on keyboards
and software sensors.

213
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,550
Like they may have an endpoint solution,

214
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,810
end point defense on the,

215
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,479
on the end points that they're protecting.

216
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,243
But there's a very human element too.

217
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:05,940
Since it's human based,
they will act as advisors.

218
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,660
Sometimes you can just call up,

219
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,209
again depending on the service,

220
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,120
you may be able to push a button

221
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,610
if you're doing an investigation

222
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,230
and you can get an expert
on the other end of the,

223
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,760
of that, that line to be
able to talk you through

224
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,593
what you're seeing.

225
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,670
So instead of just here's an alert,

226
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,959
you get this very human element.

227
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,270
They also can be out there
actively, going proactively

228
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,270
through your network or
through whichever systems

229
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,400
you've got them covering,
the endpoints for example.

230
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,040
To look for, for, to do threat hunting.

231
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,099
So they'll start looking at the IOAs,

232
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
the indicators of attack or proactively,

233
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,430
which is the, the things that
look like they're gonna go

234
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,739
wrong or look suspicious
even though you haven't had

235
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,540
an actual breach yet.

236
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,160
In addition to, if
there's an, if there's a,

237
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,199
a fast moving campaign, malware campaign

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,300
or ransomware campaign or
some other attack campaign

239
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,430
that's going on.

240
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah, they may get IOCs.

241
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,819
They may get these
indicators of compromise,

242
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,170
maybe distributor for those.

243
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,699
And then threat hunters could take those

244
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,250
and look through your organization.

245
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,640
You don't know you've had an attack yet,

246
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,800
an alert hasn't happened

247
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,780
but they'll start looking
for the IOCs for you.

248
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,040
So that, that very
proactive kind of activity.

249
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,060
And then when they do get into response,

250
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,643
that's a very active.

251
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,810
Instead of just saying,
"Hey you've got an alert.

252
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,699
Somebody outta take care of this."

253
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Your MDR provider can go from,

254
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,949
you know either just an automatic response

255
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,980
all the way up to taking
significant action

256
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,530
within your enterprise based on again,

257
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,630
the agreement you have with them

258
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,426
and what services they offer.

259
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,790
(mouse clicking)

260
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,910
- So. why don't we start to look at,

261
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,209
kind of the response end of it.

262
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,880
This is an area where there seems to be

263
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,790
a lot of differentiation
and a lot of variety

264
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,270
in the ways that even
organizations would approach it

265
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,870
especially CISOs and how
they wanna look at it.

266
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,840
And we've kind of broken
this into a spectrum.

267
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,910
And, if you think about
the spectrum looking at,

268
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,160
there's a top and a bottom

269
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,980
and they're two different approaches.

270
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,290
And that seems to be how
a lot of the organizations

271
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,240
and CISOs that we were talking to were,

272
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
you know reflecting on
how much they wanted

273
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,230
in terms of response.

274
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,920
In one case they're looking at it

275
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,670
from the action-based side.

276
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,360
And so they may be thinking in terms of,

277
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,168
you know I only want the provider to,

278
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:26,970
you know provide alerts which really isn't

279
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,480
Managed Detection and
Response at that point

280
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,050
but it's kind of that first stage.

281
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,370
And the next stage you know,
getting more in terms of

282
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,380
how much response they
would provide around the,

283
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,800
you know are they actually investigating?

284
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,890
Are they getting involved in taking action

285
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,220
on specific assets?

286
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,980
You know would they be, you
know resetting certain settings

287
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,790
or actually quarantining something?

288
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,270
You know an asset in that sense.

289
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,670
And then do you?

290
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,420
Does the customer want them to
take a full response action?

291
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,490
And so that's at the
far end of the spectrum

292
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,870
is the taking full response.

293
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,410
So, that's where it's almost
full augmentation of your team.

294
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,150
If we look at the bottom
side of the spectrum,

295
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,010
you know other organizations
or other CISOs might look at it

296
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,050
from a severity based rating.

297
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,270
So they wanna be able to
differentiate between,

298
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,699
you know if it's a severity one item,

299
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,410
you know these really low risk items

300
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,880
or maybe the more frequent types of things

301
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,070
like fishing attacks.

302
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,640
That's where they want
help and augmentation.

303
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,900
And others say, "No, I
want to be on the full end

304
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,350
of the spectrum in terms
of, you know the sev four,

305
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,680
sev five, you know
depending on how many levels

306
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,709
you may have."

307
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,540
And so it's just a
different way of looking at,

308
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,459
you know how much interaction do you want?

309
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,760
And, you know where is that
third party going to step in?

310
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,310
And it's really important to
have a clear understanding

311
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,849
of where that separation is.

312
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,830
You know in terms of who's doing what,

313
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,950
where are the handoff lies

314
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,530
and you know, trying to keep
the blur out of the lines

315
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,750
completely so that your,
your spectrum is very clear

316
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,100
and there's a differentiated line between

317
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,030
where the third party takes over

318
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,930
or where the handoff happens.

319
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,160
And so another way to look
at this as well would be

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,569
to think about it in terms of,
you know finding the balance

321
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,770
of the risk.

322
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,770
And so you know, do you want
more expertise and less access?

323
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,220
Or you know, more access and you know,

324
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,180
just finding the balance
of how much you're willing

325
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,739
to have that third party involved.

326
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,990
You know, so it's about that,
that appetite that you might

327
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,823
have for that.

328
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,860
You know is it more
important to throw bodies

329
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,520
at the really simple stuff?

330
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,199
And to maintain your own
team, you know who are

331
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,020
highly paid professionals probably.

332
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,280
You know to keep them for
the really complicated issues

333
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,569
or the complicated incidents.

334
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,069
Also you know, what about you know,

335
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,099
post event or post incident,

336
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,550
you know can the vendor rebuild
or recover your environment?

337
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,740
Maybe they could do that
faster than your team can

338
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,850
in certain settings.

339
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,380
And so, you know what's
going to be the balance there

340
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,189
in terms of you know, who has that?

341
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,090
You know and getting that
kind of rebuilding service

342
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,660
for example, you know
can be really important

343
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,069
and it can be a real big
value add for some teams.

344
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,830
There may be other things where

345
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,249
again that expertise versus
access that needs to be weighed

346
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:23,410
in terms of, you know
like if you need to reset

347
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,199
all the passwords in the environment,

348
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,790
could the vendor, you know
potentially do that more easily

349
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,610
for you than you could do for yourselves?

350
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,560
So really important again,
just to make sure that you have

351
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,349
those clear lines of distinction,

352
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,580
that clear line of demarcation
between the authority

353
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,100
and the authorization, you
know if there is going to be

354
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,263
some sort of handoff.

355
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,163
- Yeah.

356
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:46,470
And, and exactly that.

357
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,700
There's no right or there's,
there's no wrong about this.

358
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,360
There's what's right for your company.

359
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,130
So there is again, you just
making sure that you think

360
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,390
through what you want and what's
best for your organization.

361
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,290
Another big decision point
in as you talk to your,

362
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,620
your potential MDR and
we're just conflating

363
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,550
all the acronyms, we're
just gonna call MDR.

364
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,160
But as you, as you're
talking to your MDR provider,

365
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,719
is whether or not you
bring your own stack, BYOS?

366
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,733
Or if you take the stack that
they have because there's a,

367
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,939
there's a few different models here.

368
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,437
So you can bring your own
stack which means that you say,

369
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:23,840
"These are my endpoints.

370
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,850
These are the agents.

371
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,860
This is the security agent I
like having on my endpoint.

372
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,270
This is what I have for a firewall.

373
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,220
This is what I'm using for the cloud.

374
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,840
I'm gonna bring everything
that I have already

375
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,610
and my own staff, my
technology, my security stack.

376
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,610
I'm gonna bring it to
you and I want you to

377
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,250
Manage the Detection and
Response using my own,

378
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,170
my own, my own stack, my
own, my own technology."

379
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,670
You can also go with a vendor
that they are an MTR provider

380
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,839
but they don't build their
own endpoints for example,

381
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,150
they don't build their
own sensors for servers.

382
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,420
What they do is they
talk to other companies,

383
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,500
they pick and choose what
they think is the best

384
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,870
curated security stack for
organizations and experience.

385
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,560
And then they, they build out
an offering that they think

386
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,750
is gonna be the most comprehensive.

387
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,840
And then there's the,

388
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,280
the next option is a vendor-built stack.

389
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,810
So it could be that the
vendor has built their MDR.

390
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,290
So that's the sensors and
the security components

391
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,370
that are gonna go on the
endpoints in the servers

392
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,630
and within the network.

393
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,030
They've built out all of that themselves.

394
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,310
And then they say, "You buy the service,

395
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,739
you are also buying that stack
because they come together."

396
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,200
And then the last option.

397
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,480
And this one is actually
coming from a lot of MSSP is,

398
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,730
is that they may do a bit of a blended.

399
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,010
They can say, "Well, this is our stack.

400
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,040
And this is what we
recommend and what we use

401
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,349
and what most of our customers use.

402
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,300
However, if you wanna
bring a couple of pieces

403
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,540
from your stack, that's okay.

404
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,400
And we can do that for you too."

405
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,920
So you have the option.

406
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,839
That's the most important
thing to take away

407
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,500
from the stack talk.

408
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,530
The initial is that, all
of these different models,

409
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,710
you know there's a,

410
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,567
you have the choice whichever
model is right for you.

411
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,349
And the next slide I've got those some,

412
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,959
some pros and cons about
them that may help you

413
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,849
to make a decision on one
of these, one or the other.

414
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,550
So looking at the bring your own stack,

415
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,869
where you tend to get a
real, like you know a real

416
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,963
up on this one is the big pro is that,

417
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,790
is that you have a very limited lock-in.

418
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,830
If you decide that you
don't wanna work with that,

419
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,567
that MDR vendor anymore, it's your stack.

420
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:36,150
You just pick it up and you can go

421
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,140
and you can take it with you.

422
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,130
Now with your staff though, you may have

423
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,450
somethings to think about
here because you're bringing

424
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,660
your own stack and they may need to do

425
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,680
a lot of the same work
that they've been doing

426
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,070
to manage and maintain that stack before.

427
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,919
And then integration is
another consideration

428
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,320
when you bring in your own stack.

429
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,100
Because, if you've done
the work to integrate

430
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,780
those different pieces of your
security stack, that's great.

431
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,950
You can, now that, that is an advantage

432
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,660
for the MDR provider.

433
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,130
But if you haven't done the
integration then you may be,

434
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,530
you may get some things like you know,

435
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,260
some of the black holes or
blind spots that come out of it.

436
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,230
So if you wanna bring your own stack,

437
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,240
if you're a really mature
program within your security

438
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,758
program and, and you
know what you've picked

439
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:23,120
because you need, you have
a lot of regulatory needs.

440
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,610
Maybe bring your own stack.

441
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,979
You don't wanna replace it.

442
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,810
You don't want what the
vendor is gonna provide.

443
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,350
You want them to manage your stack.

444
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,429
In vendor supply, you very
often have a much tighter

445
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,340
integration because that's
one thing the vendors work on.

446
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,550
But if they're supplying the stack,

447
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,230
now you've got a little
bit of a lock-in because

448
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,460
you could either go and buy
all those tools somewhere else

449
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,620
but you're buying the
tools from the vendor.

450
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,870
And then the stack and
tack can be a little bit

451
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,929
blended there because they,
they may not know how to use

452
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,590
this new tooling that the
M, that the provider has.

453
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,706
So vendor supply, good for an
easy start because they say,

454
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,070
"You don't have to worry about it.

455
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,500
We're just, we're gonna
supply the stack for you."

456
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,120
And you have some pretty low
decision overhead but remember,

457
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,572
you are getting some element of lock-in.

458
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,210
With the vendor built, you
have a very tight lock-in.

459
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,710
Because now it's they built
it and they manage it for you.

460
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,610
So they, they've got both sides of that.

461
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,679
If that's the right stack
for you then that's great

462
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,470
because the integration, of
course if it's vendor built

463
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,530
and they're doing the management,

464
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,460
you've got the tightest set
of integration possible.

465
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,380
You've also got the biggest
benefit for your staff because

466
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,380
in most cases, the MDR
provider is not gonna be doing

467
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,928
most of that resource work.

468
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,800
So you're gonna be able to you know,

469
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,500
lift and and ease some of the
resources for your own staff.

470
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,810
But again, you do have that
lock-in because you've got

471
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,940
the vendor providing
both the technology stack

472
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,690
and the managed services

473
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,970
but you've got that big of a
highly integrated solution.

474
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,790
And then in blended
it's a little bit of a,

475
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,080
of a mix on all of these
because it's gonna depend on

476
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,340
your provider, what you've
blended and your own resources.

477
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,720
So the blended is gonna
be the most up in the air.

478
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,150
We have to think about
what your pros and cons are

479
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,170
but it's gonna give you
a lot of flexibility.

480
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,440
And if you do have
special regulatory needs

481
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,220
within your stack, you're gonna
be able to like in the full

482
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,310
bring your own stack.

483
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,652
You can also have that
supported in the blended.

484
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,950
(mouse clicking)

485
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,620
- So one of the next areas to think about

486
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,419
is in terms of visibility.

487
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,760
You know how much of the,
of your own environment

488
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,480
can the provider cover?

489
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,580
You know how much
visibility will they have

490
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,970
into your environment?

491
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,230
And you know, think about
across the third party systems

492
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,290
that you may have or even the operating,

493
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,210
operating systems that you may have.

494
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,020
You know, Diana mentioned you know,

495
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,629
thinking about the blind
spots that might pop up.

496
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,680
You know are there potential issues

497
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,240
with multi-cloud environments?

498
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,300
Or maybe they won't have visibility.

499
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,180
And you know how much access do they need?

500
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,220
Will they be able to see
different data types?

501
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,750
You know or will they just
be able to see labels?

502
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,410
You know and is there a provider that,

503
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,530
that for your particular environment

504
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,110
that who can see all the way across?

505
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,360
And is that what you need?

506
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,790
So these are you know, just
some sort of key questions

507
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,129
around visibility.

508
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,700
And then the other side of that,

509
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,220
is really on the privacy side of it.

510
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,070
You know looking at,

511
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,720
you know how much access
are you extending to them?

512
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,290
You know in terms of, if
they have access to data,

513
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,570
are they able to see your
confidential data like the PII,

514
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,172
the PHI, the health
information and so forth?

515
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:30,960
You know and looking back at
your spectrum of decision,

516
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,970
you know that may, that
spectrum may help you decide,

517
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,790
you know what kind of impact
there may be to privacy

518
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,570
because of the access
that you may be providing.

519
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,030
You know is it possible
that data classification

520
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,320
could be a control
factor in the sense that

521
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,000
maybe they can just see the
data classification labels

522
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,090
but not actually have
access to the data itself?

523
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,030
Would that provide enough for the types of

524
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,340
either investigation
or incident management?

525
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,139
You know that they're
able to take the actions

526
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,500
that you require.

527
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,190
And then you're just in terms
of the, the vendor trust.

528
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,890
You know is it possible that
if it's a particular vendor

529
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,690
that's providing the service
and they've already done

530
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,300
the background checks
and the experience checks

531
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,310
and so forth.

532
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,270
And you feel comfortable with the reviews

533
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,370
that they're doing.

534
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,360
Will that somehow offset
some of the due diligence

535
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,510
that you might do of the vendor
or that might be required?

536
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,900
So is that, that gold seal, is that enough

537
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,350
for the review that you need?

538
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,010
(mouse clicking)

539
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,150
And then in terms of the,
the power of threat Intel.

540
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,400
You know just thinking about,

541
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,190
you know is your Intel good enough or not?

542
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,000
Better, more Intel is
always better in most cases.

543
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,330
If you're able to sort through it,

544
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,949
if you're able to correlate it.

545
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,560
You know is it possible
that maybe your threat Intel

546
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
is lacking in some areas?

547
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,070
So is there a big benefit here?

548
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,310
So maybe you need that
kind of augmentation.

549
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,010
And in terms of, you know
indicators of compromise

550
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,830
and indicators of
attack, do you need both?

551
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,850
You know thinking about
your own environment

552
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,679
and the types of threats
that you're seeing

553
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,450
and the types of incidents
that you're seeing.

554
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,380
You know the better
detection, you know you're,

555
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,810
it's really going to help you a lot

556
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,080
but the correlation is so key to that.

557
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,020
So for example, if you
are walking into a forest

558
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,379
and someone's telling you that

559
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,110
there are a lot of snakes in the forest,

560
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,550
that's great information.

561
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,030
But if you know that most of
those snakes are poisonous,

562
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,700
then that becomes really important.

563
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,150
So, you know correlating
the different pieces

564
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,890
just becomes very valuable.

565
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,610
And, you know how well will
the service that you're getting

566
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,250
integrate with the existing
feeds that you already may have?

567
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,610
You know, who's monitoring what?

568
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,350
You know this is where
that handoff or that,

569
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,219
that line of segmentation
becomes very important.

570
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,144
So you make sure that
there's absolutely no gap,

571
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,830
no area that's going
uncovered merely because

572
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,293
there was a misunderstanding.

573
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:53,229
(mouse clicking)

574
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,063
- Yeah.

575
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,840
And that leads to, with your
staff augmentation and that,

576
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,459
that question of who needs MDR.

577
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,710
When I first started hearing about MDR,

578
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,910
I heard about it being
deployed at smaller mid-sized

579
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,920
companies as almost a
replacement for security staff.

580
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,270
And I thought well, big
company would never need it.

581
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,370
But then doing research
and speaking to CISOs,

582
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,110
I realized that no, it
actually again, it's this,

583
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,080
it's this spectrum.

584
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,780
So, at the very mature
or research, resource,

585
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,853
well research programs,
they're interested in MDR

586
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:26,210
because they want a second set
of eyeballs or in this case

587
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,040
a whole bunch of set of
eyeballs 'cause they have these

588
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,428
live people on the other side
that are also hunting through

589
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:35,160
your network looking for
anything that's a miss.

590
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,450
So, you know some very big
well resource companies are,

591
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,620
are finding it's very valuable.

592
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,629
Also companies that are experienced
but they just don't have

593
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,540
the, the money or the resources
right now to do FTE hires.

594
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,610
They can find that MDR really
helps augment their very

595
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,939
already experienced program
but under-resourced program.

596
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,490
And then, they're also
for some programs that it,

597
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,450
you know as, as sort of expected,
that they don't have the,

598
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,950
they haven't gotten the maturity,

599
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,320
they need some help with that.

600
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,250
They also need help with resources.

601
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,100
And in that case it can be a real lifeline

602
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,331
to have MDR to augment.

603
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:12,468
(mouse clicking)

604
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,430
The next thing that you should think about

605
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,580
is how much automation.

606
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,280
So we know that we talked about humans

607
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,340
and what the humans are gonna do

608
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,070
and that they're hunting
over activity within your,

609
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,399
within your systems.

610
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,070
But, there's also a lot of
automation that's included

611
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,200
with these solutions.

612
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,960
And just automation is one of
those things that tends to be

613
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,150
really, really appealing.

614
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,947
I mean it would absolutely,
wouldn't it be wonderful if I?

615
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:38,389
I want a, I still want
an automated driving car,

616
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,750
you know I hate to drive.

617
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,850
And I would love to have a
car that just push a button

618
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,379
but we're not quite there, right?

619
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,330
These cars run into problems.

620
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,919
They get confused.

621
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,080
They, you know sometimes
do unprotected left turns

622
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,913
when they shouldn't.

623
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:52,160
A whole lot of things happen
with, with automation.

624
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,040
So just keep that in mind when
you're talking to the vendor

625
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,480
about what they can give
you for true automation

626
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,010
and then what, what you,
where you might wanna limit

627
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,843
or scope that.

628
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:05,290
Because what can happen
in automation gone bad

629
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,740
is that you break your system.

630
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,610
You create business interruption

631
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,090
and you know now people can't
get to a critical workload

632
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,379
or a critical server or
your mail stops working.

633
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,900
You know, there are a lot
of things that can happen

634
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,680
when you start turning things
on and off automatically.

635
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,370
So talk it through with your vendor,

636
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,270
make sure what you're comfortable with.

637
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,350
Overall automation is really,
can be extremely helpful

638
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,100
and these sort of low impact
decisions and actions.

639
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,830
So if it's, I've got an endpoint
and there's malware on it.

640
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,570
Sure, automatically clean that out.

641
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,300
You wanna do that as fast as possible.

642
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,540
If it's something that's
a little bit higher impact

643
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,629
like reset everybody's
password at the company,

644
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,260
you might wanna have a human involved

645
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,453
in that decision chain.

646
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,350
(mouse clicking)

647
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,929
- So also don't, don't
ignore the questions

648
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,780
and the things that you need to consider

649
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,950
around reports and audits.

650
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,900
And then we'll talk
about some future state

651
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,460
considerations too but, you
know in terms of reports,

652
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,530
you know what kind of output do you need?

653
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,750
Over time can you get
the kind of analytics

654
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,130
that'll really help you?

655
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,733
You know analytics, analytics
on the types of incidents

656
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,360
that might've flared up.

657
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,959
And were they resolved?

658
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,160
You know can you get reports
on the response actions

659
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,270
that were taken?

660
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,490
And can you clearly link those
to a specific individual?

661
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,800
You know, do you have
the kind of forensics

662
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,633
that you'll need?

663
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,440
You know I'd like to think
about it in terms of,

664
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,860
if I had to go to court with this,

665
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,560
do I have an adequate case?

666
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,240
Do I have enough information
to prove what happened,

667
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,720
to prove who did what
when, and maybe even why?

668
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,507
And so that comes into play
also with the audit side of it.

669
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:36,830
You're making sure that you
have appropriate evidence

670
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,730
for your auditors as
well as your regulators

671
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,200
if that applies to you.

672
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,080
Making sure that those audit trails are,

673
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,750
are sufficient again to show
you know, who touched what?

674
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,390
What did they actually see or access?

675
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,140
And what kind of change was made?

676
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,720
And you know, can you clearly
demonstrate who did that?

677
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,730
Because that's so critical
both in terms of audits

678
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,030
as well as those legal
cases that may pop up.

679
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,870
You know will your audit trails be enough?

680
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,939
Will they be sufficient and
have enough information in them?

681
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,120
And, you know can that MXDR
gold seal that we talked about,

682
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,810
you know is that going to be enough

683
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,840
to stand in for your due diligence?

684
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,889
Or are you gonna need something more?

685
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,380
And so you know, making sure that the,

686
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,830
the steps that the vendor is
taking to review their own team

687
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,270
and their personnel is adequate.

688
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,570
Or that you're doing your own.

689
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,010
Now in terms of future state,
you know is it possible that

690
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,920
an MXDR can really step
in to provide a service

691
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,870
for you in a merger and acquisition?

692
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,580
So for example, if
you've acquired a company

693
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,260
and you're not comfortable,

694
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,750
you don't know enough about them yet

695
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,770
to know whether you trust their team

696
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,300
to identify incidents and
to respond to incidents

697
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,270
adequately.

698
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,639
Could it be possible
that this type of service

699
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,730
could step in, in the case
of a merger and acquisition

700
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,980
and provide that kind of
comfort that you need?

701
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,630
What about, you know the access
that third parties may have

702
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,660
or the trade secrets that they have

703
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,380
and the highly sensitive data.

704
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,283
You know maybe you don't feel
comfortable with the controls

705
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:07,800
that they have around that.

706
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,350
You don't want anything leaking out.

707
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,899
You know this might be another
one of those in terms of,

708
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,130
you know knowing that they
can take adequate response

709
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,930
in an incident so that,
you know data isn't getting

710
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,860
taken off.

711
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,850
Knowing that they can shut it down and,

712
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,560
and knowing the process that
they would go around that.

713
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,240
And then again, you know this just becomes

714
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,260
sort of a gold seal for partners.

715
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,700
If you know that they're
using a service from a vendor

716
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,430
that you trust and you not
only trust but you've reviewed

717
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,810
their process and their systems you know,

718
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,290
do you feel comfortable
then with that partner?

719
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,463
Does that make you feel better
about your supply chain?

720
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,613
- Exactly.

721
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,810
And the last high level
thing to think about

722
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,649
as you're getting ready
to talk to your vendors

723
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,097
and maybe buy one of these
services or solutions is,

724
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:54,550
what's your total cost of ownership?

725
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,010
And make sure you get
your metrics in place.

726
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,680
Every year the Ponemon
Institute comes out with

727
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,180
a cost of data breach report
where they show well that

728
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,330
if you can get down your MTTI,
your meantime to identify,

729
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,730
mean time to contain
and mean time to respond

730
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,500
to incidents that's gonna
save you a lot overall

731
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
and the cost of the incident.

732
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,550
So, is the MDR gonna
be able to supply that?

733
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,310
We've talked about blind spots.

734
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,159
But what about, can
the MDR also see things

735
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,830
that maybe that you
weren't able to see before?

736
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,659
Are you now able to reduce
your staff which is gonna save

737
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,840
the company money?

738
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,780
Or maybe repurpose your
staff 'cause you've got very,

739
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,280
you know high, high level
resources that don't need to go

740
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,261
do the hunting necessarily.

741
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,440
Now they can do some more strategic worth,

742
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,510
work at your company.

743
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,400
Lots of different ways to get a TCO,

744
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,820
but make sure again that
you find your metrics

745
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,340
so you can validate.

746
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,830
And then this one, and
Lisa you've introduced

747
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,697
your own Veg-O-Matics.

748
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,589
I'm gonna let you talk
to through those last.

749
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,919
- You know we just do our
own alphabet in there.

750
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,600
You know so, a lot of people
like to talk about ROI

751
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
but you know maybe what
you need to be looking at

752
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,150
is the value of the service
or the return on the service.

753
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,740
More so than, you know
return on investment.

754
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,900
And so that may just be a,
that was just our fun way of

755
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,153
throwing a couple extra
alphabets in there.

756
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,716
- Yeah, so we hope that this
has helped giving you a good

757
00:31:12,716 --> 00:31:16,489
overview of what to think
about so that you're not just

758
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,580
feeling bombarded by
vendor noise and acronyms.

759
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,750
That just kind of break
it down that these are

760
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,760
really great services
doing different kinds

761
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,490
of detection and response.

762
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,140
And think about in advance,
what kind of problem

763
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,780
you want to solve before you
speak, talk to your vendor.

764
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,490
And make some decisions about,
do we want our own stack?

765
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,870
Are we trying to reduce staffing costs?

766
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,719
What's, what's the right
part of the response spectrum

767
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,553
for us?

768
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:44,130
Think those through in
advance so that when you talk

769
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,440
to the vendor, you know
you're gonna get the solution

770
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,900
that's right for you.

771
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,160
And don't forget also to
normalize your questionnaire,

772
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,770
so that you can get
apples-to-apples responses.

773
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,870
Sometimes vendors say the same things

774
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,350
but with very different words.

775
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,100
So you wanna make sure
that you've got your idea

776
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,510
of technically what controls
you want, what return you want,

777
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,870
what your own metrics are.

778
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,310
So that instead of you getting
caught in the Veg-O-Matic,

779
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,159
you're gonna be the one
who's, you know upfront

780
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,547
driving the decision.

781
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,060
(mouse clicking)

782
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,669
- And so we hope that we've,
you know given you all of the,

783
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,920
or at least a lot of the
information that you need

784
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,830
to make the analysis.

785
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,199
So how do you get started?

786
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,770
You know, in the next week
you can really sit down

787
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,480
and define your problem set.

788
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,140
Which I think includes an assessment

789
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,910
of your current capabilities.

790
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,670
So what problem are you trying to solve?

791
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,890
But also what capability,
capabilities do you have

792
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,420
toward that problem already?

793
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,840
And consider where you
might be on the spectrum.

794
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,209
Where would you wanna give
access, you know versus

795
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,680
what type of incident or
response would they have?

796
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,420
So where did, where are you
on the spectrum of response

797
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,368
but also where are you on
the balance of the risk?

798
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,210
(mouse clicking)

799
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,060
- And in the next three months
if you do wanna purchase

800
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,090
an MDR after you've defined your problems

801
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,820
and you think this is right,

802
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,939
start talking to the
vendors and assessing them

803
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,250
and building out your RFP.

804
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,310
And in six months, you should,

805
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,060
- In six months, you wanna think about

806
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,040
that shiny pretty thing
that you were looking for.

807
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,820
Did you get the flying car

808
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,669
or was it just a shiny pretty thing?

809
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,503
- Yeah.

810
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:16,730
You get hitting those metrics.

811
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,250
Have you been better with breaches?

812
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,850
At least breaches may occur even with MDR

813
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,899
but are you responding more quickly?

814
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,560
So starting to look at that
and maybe even if you start

815
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,820
to catch things that you
did before loss occurred.

816
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,520
So, we wish you a lot of luck
with your MDR deployments.

817
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,280
We have some resources
here in the last slide

818
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,530
for you to take a look
at that we think as you,

819
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,290
now that you've got this, this
great baseline or you know,

820
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,379
high level overview or framework,

821
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,290
there's some great resources out there.

822
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,730
I particularly like the
Detect Mappings in NIST.

823
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,130
There's the Ponemon Cost
of Data Breach that I had

824
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,990
talked about.

825
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,700
And then also there's a
CIS Response Plan Template

826
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,630
for the NIST CSF that may
help with responding to

827
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,600
a cyber incident.

828
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,879
So we wish you great luck in your,

829
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,910
in your response and detection work.

830
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,170
And we hope that this help
gave you a better view of

831
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:12,110
the overall Managed Detection
and Response market.

832
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,840
- So we are looking forward
to answering your questions

833
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,719
as well.

834
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,299
- Yes, thank you so much.
