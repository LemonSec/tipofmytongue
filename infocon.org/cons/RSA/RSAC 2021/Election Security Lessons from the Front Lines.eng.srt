00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,580
- Hello, RSA and welcome to
a panel on Election Security,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,160
Elections belong to the
people, it's their decision.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,240
If they decide to turn
their back on the fire

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,870
and burn their behinds

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,110
then they will just have
to sit on their blisters.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,169
That quote was by Abraham Lincoln.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,940
Elections are critical in
a free and fair society.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,700
Public trust in election infrastructure

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,380
begins with understanding
what the government has done

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,830
with transparency and how we
as citizens in the community

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,599
have a role to play as well.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,170
My name is Bryson Bort,
I'll be today's moderator.

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,450
My full-time job, I'm the founder and CEO

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,890
of a startup called SCYTHE.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,310
We'll start with introductions

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,110
from our distinguished
panelists, beginning with Lester.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,670
- Hello everybody, my
name is Lester Godsey.

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,550
I'm the Chief Information
Security and Privacy Officer

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,320
for Maricopa County.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,740
I'm sure most of you have
heard us in the news,

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,490
but for those of you not
familiar with Maricopa County,

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,570
by population, we're the
fourth largest county

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,680
in the United States.

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,563
And needless to say,
2020 was quite a year.

25
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:04,902
- Cynthia

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,899
- Thanks Bryson, my
name is Cynthia Kaiser.

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm a Section Chief with
the FBI Cyber Division,

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,020
at where I've been in analytically

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,420
for election threat since 2017.

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,630
I'm really excited to be here today

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,130
to talk about what we saw in 2020

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,429
and how that might affect
some of our expectations

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,963
for 2022 and beyond.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,113
- And Geoff.

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,380
- Thanks, Bryson and happy to be here.

36
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,213
My name is Geoff Hale.

37
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:33,600
I lead the Election
Security Initiative at CISA,

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,210
the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency.

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,020
I've been a part of this
election security mission

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,372
since 2016 and seen it, a lot of growth.

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,289
- All right, Lester we're
gonna start with you.

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,783
What did you see in 2020?

43
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,690
- Well, probably a
better way of putting it,

44
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,070
is what we didn't see,
which was very little.

45
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,559
From a technical perspective,

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,450
we saw a variety of
different tactics applied.

47
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,330
And one thing I wanna remind our audience

48
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,250
is that 2020 had three
different election cycles in it.

49
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,550
So the presidential preferential election,

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,580
the primary and then the general election.

51
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,640
And so over the course
of actual calendar year,

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,489
we saw quite the variety of attacks.

53
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,040
And so we saw your typical port scanning,

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,260
we saw DDoS attacks.

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,690
We saw a number of different activities

56
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,060
from a social media perspective,

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
and really everything in between.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,640
But I will definitely say
that from a 2020 perspective,

59
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,480
one of our biggest challenges
and what came to the forefront

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,660
was challenges around
misinformation and disinformation

61
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,541
from a social media perspective,

62
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,970
that in itself really was a game changer

63
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,913
from our perspective here
at Maricopa County for sure.

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,173
- Cynthia.

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,660
- So I hope folks have been able to go

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,930
and read the ODNI report,

67
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,000
the annual report from
the Department of Justice

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
and Department of Homeland Security.

69
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,690
And that goes into a lot of detail

70
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,210
about what we observed during
the 2020 election cycle.

71
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,060
But for me, I hope there's
enough three takeaways

72
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,860
people take from those reports.

73
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,860
One is the unprecedented way
that federal, local, state,

74
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,790
election officials, private
sector and the public

75
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,429
all work together to be able to understand

76
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,910
what was going on across
all the election systems.

77
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,880
And that really gave us
confidence in the conclusions

78
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,410
that we came to in those reports.

79
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,010
It allowed us to have
a transparent feeling

80
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,269
about what had occurred and
understand the information

81
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,310
that was going into all of those.

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,680
Second is, we have no evidence

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,600
and not through our collection
on foreign actors themselves,

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,390
not through our monitoring
of voting systems,

85
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,839
not through our audits after the fact,

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,580
not through any other means

87
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,290
that foreign or other actors sought

88
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,010
to manipulate election results.

89
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,079
And then third though, so we
didn't see the adversaries

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,680
kind of go after the ballot box,

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,370
but we saw them try to
influence our minds.

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,180
Really with an aim towards
destabilizing society.

93
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,560
And they did that through
a variety of means.

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,240
The actors, mainly from Iran and Russia,

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,240
were amplifying content they
already found on social media,

96
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
creating new content, going
through intermediaries,

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,420
trying to intimidate voters directly.

98
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,960
Post-election trying to
intimidate the election officials

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,719
and exacerbate tensions further.

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,720
And I think really then, looking
towards what we can learn

101
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,560
from that then is really how much

102
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,900
of a whole of society
effort all of this is.

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,120
And that goes towards government officials

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,080
who need to be having the
regular information sharing

105
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,820
with election officials and
giving indicators of compromise

106
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,180
and doing the public
service announcements.

107
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,780
That goes to the private
sector who are pointing folks

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,400
to verify sources of information
and taking down content

109
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,099
that violates their terms of service

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,180
or flagging the different
cyber campaigns they're seeing.

111
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,340
But it goes to the public.

112
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,710
It goes to everyday Americans

113
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,710
where we all have to be
better consumers of the media

114
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,590
that we're taking in, the
information we're taking in,

115
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,299
and critically evaluate
information we're taking in,

116
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,320
and go out and seek
those verified sources.

117
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,349
So, really looking at kind
of those three takeaways

118
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,350
from what we saw in 2020, I
come down to thinking through

119
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,140
how much work we all are
continuing to do and need to do

120
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,733
in this space to make sure that we aren't,

121
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,343
we aren't feeding into
any adversary campaigns.

122
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,990
- Yeah, specifically the
report you were mentioning

123
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,460
was the foreign threats to
the 2020 US federal election,

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,370
published by the National
Intelligence Council

125
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,563
on the 10th of March.

126
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,140
- That one, as well as
on the 10th of March

127
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,360
there was, shortly after
there was one published

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,510
by the Department of Justice

129
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,159
and Department of Homeland Security

130
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,770
that talked about the
impacts to infrastructure

131
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,460
and provide a recommendations as well.

132
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,863
- Excellent, Geoff.

133
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,340
- So, Cynthia makes some great points

134
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,239
about the 2020 election having
far more security safeguards

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,910
and capabilities in place
than any election beforehand.

136
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,740
Never have we had the same
level of information sharing

137
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,730
pushed down to state and
local election officials,

138
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,540
pushed to their private sector partners.

139
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,150
Never have we had this level
of scrutiny on an election.

140
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,780
And it's important to say

141
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,700
that even though this
was a model election,

142
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,210
we had two APT actors present.

143
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,210
This ODNI report describes both
Russia and Iran being active

144
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,099
on election infrastructure,
being active in social media,

145
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,680
in disinformation and influence campaigns.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,090
This kind of starts the new normal

147
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,710
for what threats and risks on
election infrastructure are.

148
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,440
We saw the playbook in
2016, it evolved in 2020,

149
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,380
we're gonna have to be ready
for it in elections to come.

150
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,230
- So Lester, Geoff just talked
about how information sharing

151
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,290
has improved and as we
spoken before this panel,

152
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,980
there has been a large shift
from what we saw in 2016.

153
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,490
And you couched that in what we've seen

154
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,660
versus what we haven't
seen in your response.

155
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,180
Do you feel at your level
that the federal government

156
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,030
was really providing you the
information that you needed?

157
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,229
- Short answer is absolutely.

158
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,120
So traditionally from my
perspective, years pass,

159
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,430
it used to feel like information sharing

160
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,310
was more or less one way
to be honest with you.

161
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,310
And so I think, and again
I started to see a shift

162
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,380
in general election aside

163
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,360
with regards to the formation
of CISA as part of DHS.

164
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,860
So we started seeing a
more collaborative fashion.

165
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,429
And then on top of that we've
seen additional collaboration

166
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,429
with our partners at the FBI,

167
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,229
actually Secret Service as
well, et cetera, et cetera,

168
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,919
but specific to the 2020
elections we just saw,

169
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,640
it was a night and day difference

170
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,050
in terms of intelligence sharing.

171
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,512
So in the case of Maricopa County,

172
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,740
we basically created a
specialized playbooks

173
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,570
specifically around the elections

174
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,500
and a big portion of that
playbook not only was our tactical

175
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,900
or technology based response
to things that we would see,

176
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,069
but also the communication protocols.

177
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,190
So in our instance with day of election

178
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,215
and actually leading up to it,

179
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,500
we utilize portions of our playbook

180
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,730
especially around social media monitoring.

181
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,680
And then we were reporting
what we were seeing internally

182
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,989
within the organization,
and then passing that along

183
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,560
to our fusion center here,

184
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,060
which then obviously
disseminated that information

185
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,650
to our federal partners.

186
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,030
But for example, day of general election,

187
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,622
we started at 5:00 AM
reporting on an hourly basis.

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,260
General activity that we saw,

189
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,420
that also included social media.

190
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,099
Because one of the
things that we discovered

191
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,330
from an intelligence
perspective is social media

192
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,330
not only was a source of intelligence

193
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,670
with regards to cyber activity,

194
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,370
but some of those things that we observed

195
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,340
might translate into
kinetic events as well,

196
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,393
protests, things of that sort.

197
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,443
And then just to get to the heart

198
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:04,723
of your question there, Bryson,

199
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,560
to Geoff's point, we actually saw a day of

200
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,869
evidence of one of these Advanced
Persistent Threat groups.

201
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,230
And so then out of cycle

202
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,080
then we communicate that accordingly.

203
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,120
And so we were in contact
with the FBI that day

204
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,580
to validate what we had seen
versus what they had seen

205
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,360
in other regions in the United States.

206
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,510
So it was very collaborative,
it was excellent.

207
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,930
And honestly in terms of communication,

208
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,959
that's been the most collaborative effort

209
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,310
I've ever been involved in.

210
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,880
- And Geoff, this speaks a lot

211
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,689
to where we've seen a
strategic shifts in CISA

212
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,470
over the past couple of years.

213
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,377
Can you talk more about that?

214
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,463
- Thanks Bryson.

215
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:54,140
Yeah, really one of the biggest
impacts we were able to have

216
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,160
was by funding the
establishment of the EIISAC,

217
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,490
or the Election Infrastructure
Information Sharing

218
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,510
and Analysis Center.

219
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,740
This was really a recognition

220
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,320
that there's like a tailored need

221
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
for the protection of
election infrastructure.

222
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,230
So getting all 50 States
signed up for that,

223
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,810
and then pushing our focus down

224
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,060
to how to help a local
election jurisdictions,

225
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,000
really that's where elections
are run and administered.

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,390
It's easier to talk about
elections as all 50 States

227
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,110
but when you really think
of 8,000 jurisdictions

228
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,890
and the individual needs and changes

229
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,300
of each of those jurisdictions,

230
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,479
we had to start to recognize
the relationship at that level

231
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,720
and start to tailor our services
of how we can provide value

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,100
to those election officials.

233
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,310
We focused on, ensure the
cybersecurity services

234
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,310
that's is known for cyber hygiene,

235
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,949
remote penetration testing,
vulnerability scanning,

236
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,740
risk and vulnerability assessments.

237
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,220
But a lot of it was more,

238
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,810
how do we focus on
incident response planning?

239
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,969
How do you identify an incident?

240
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,360
Who do you need to tell?

241
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,430
Where are you getting assistance

242
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,630
if you're a local jurisdiction?

243
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,540
We'd go through scenario
based planning, exercises.

244
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,089
That's where a lot of the value

245
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,810
that I think CISA was able to provide.

246
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,239
Just having those relationships,

247
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,860
being arm-in-arm with FBI
and local FBI officers,

248
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,080
as we present a unified federal government

249
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,253
to our state and local partners.

250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,860
- Well Cynthia, Lester
also gave your organization

251
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,693
a shout out there,

252
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,770
if you could expand on
that a little bit more.

253
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,949
- Yeah, happy to and I think Lester

254
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,260
made some really good points
about information sharing,

255
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,540
being better, both ways.

256
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,630
So I think the federal
governments, FBI, CISA,

257
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,390
were pushing information
out to election officials.

258
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,420
At the same time,

259
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,360
at the same time I think we were getting

260
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,680
a lot of information in
from election officials,

261
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,912
and that made everybody safer.

262
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:45,120
So, really I think the majority
information were emailed

263
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,150
or pushed out to network defenders,

264
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,150
was because local or state
officials saw something,

265
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,319
thought it looks suspicious,
contacted the FBI,

266
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,510
contacted CISA and then we were
able to get that out further

267
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,920
and say, here's something that
you need to watch out for.

268
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,780
But, in terms of how FBI
was really involved in this,

269
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,930
I think that the partnership with CISA

270
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,839
and CISA how they worked
with us, it was just so close

271
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,480
and so such an easy relationship

272
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,910
because we had such a clarity of mission

273
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,469
and what we were trying to accomplish.

274
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,470
And we were on the calls with
CISA and election officials,

275
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,670
every other week, talking to them,

276
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,949
having various other
meetings when we needed to

277
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,930
or when threats arose.

278
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,739
And I think all that collaboration
made all of us better.

279
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,860
We understood from the FBI perspective

280
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,380
what we actually needed to push to them.

281
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,330
And they understood when
we're using certain language

282
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,570
or getting this information out to them,

283
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,250
it means this is information
that's actionable

284
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,600
and needs to be taken on board.

285
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,700
I'd highlight one particular policy

286
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,490
that the FBI spearheaded in
early 2020, which is the,

287
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,350
where we mandated

288
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,940
any time there was a
local election incident,

289
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,520
that the Chief State Election
official was also notified.

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,520
And CISA has as an additional
policy that mirrors that.

291
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,140
And so anytime there was
these local election,

292
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,510
potential incidents,
CISA and FBI were going

293
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,110
to the Chief State Election officials,

294
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,620
so the Secretary of State or equivalence,

295
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,840
and talking to them
about what was happening.

296
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,440
And I think that that really
gave everybody confidence.

297
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,810
And after the election

298
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,089
that those Chief State Election
officials knew what we knew

299
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,420
and could make decisions

300
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,520
and make their certifications accordingly.

301
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,440
- Okay, now the tough
question for the panel.

302
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,850
We've talked a lot about
foreign threat and influence.

303
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,600
We briefly touched about the fact

304
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,060
that there was some domestic.

305
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,130
So the hot button topic of disinformation,

306
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,470
which we've seen both
foreign and domestically,

307
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,230
and we still see the continued effects

308
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,030
of domestic disinformation
with thoughts on the election

309
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,730
which is a large challenge for us.

310
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,700
So I'm not going to put
anyone on the spot yet

311
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,530
who wants to be first
to jump into domestic

312
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,220
versus foreign disinformation

313
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,300
and what can be done at different levels.

314
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,910
I see Lester with his hand raised.

315
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,803
Lester you're up.

316
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,530
- So maybe I can kick this off.

317
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,810
And then our federal partners
can kind of add some flavor

318
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,099
to it from a national perspective.

319
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,340
We,

320
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,430
social media disinformation
and misinformation

321
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,120
was a game changer for us.

322
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,930
And I would go so far as to say

323
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,510
from a government
perspective, moving forward

324
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,710
any cybersecurity or
information security teams,

325
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,000
they should be adding this
to their portfolio services.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,530
Because this is not gonna go away

327
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,949
just because the election's over, frankly.

328
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,150
I think we're in a new era, if you will,

329
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,660
in terms of additional threats and risks,

330
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,199
as well as source of
information for all of us.

331
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,560
But back to the 2020
elections, we saw quite a bit

332
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,313
of this activity and it wasn't
necessarily just your normal,

333
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,710
if you will, or popular
consumer social media platforms,

334
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,580
we saw plenty of that,

335
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,700
to give you an example
of my statement earlier

336
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,920
about how social media threat intelligence

337
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,060
might translate into a kinetic event.

338
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,430
We actually picked up
intelligence on social media

339
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,380
about people using that
platform to coordinate a caravan

340
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,600
to follow our election staff

341
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,410
when they were moving from
one location to another.

342
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,160
And so that obviously
presented itself as a risk,

343
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,120
depending on what would
occur along those lines.

344
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,230
Obviously, we saw a lot of evidence

345
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,360
with regards to coordination
and communication

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,340
about protests which
obviously everybody's welcome

347
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,940
to protest as long as it's
done in a safe fashion.

348
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,900
But another example that
was really interesting

349
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,459
and this goes back to
the intelligence sharing

350
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,330
with our federal partners
is the fusion centers

351
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,730
throughout the United
States, did an excellent job

352
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,619
at communicated with one another

353
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,280
and the locals receiving that information.

354
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,829
So we heard from a fusion center

355
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:14,829
who just had made an observation
about third party vendor

356
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,030
who was popular in the government space

357
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,200
in terms of government services

358
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,250
and collaboration, if you will.

359
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,829
And so we received some
intelligence with regards to that.

360
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,500
We determined that was a platform

361
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
that we were familiar with.

362
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,843
And so upon further investigation,

363
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:39,460
we saw evidence of utilization of bots

364
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,380
to automatically register
thousands upon thousands

365
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,120
of new users on this platform.

366
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,000
And so we reached out
to our federal partners

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and that vendor, and again,
it's not the local's job

368
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:57,659
to articulate where the
threat originated from.

369
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,710
We just reported it, but I
think that was a good example

370
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,130
on a high degree of likelihood

371
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,380
that we were able to
circumvent a situation

372
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,503
where that platform was being
used to spread disinformation.

373
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,480
- I think it's often
helpful to reframe this

374
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,713
as a bit of a supply and demand challenge.

375
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,293
We have in the US government,

376
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,250
some of the most robust capabilities

377
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,660
to degrade disinformation actors

378
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,010
if they're coming from foreign sources.

379
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,100
The intelligence community,
the FBI, do a phenomenal job

380
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,750
of being able to identify and take action

381
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,710
against the threat actors.

382
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,120
But at some level that's
a game of whack-a-mole.

383
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,260
You're always chasing and just reacting

384
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,129
to disinformation spreaders.

385
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,940
And disinformation here being

386
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,840
the spreading of false information
with intent to do harm,

387
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,889
as opposed to misinformation where it's,

388
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,630
again false information
without the malicious intent.

389
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,180
So the ability to target

390
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,950
that those threat actors interventions

391
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,940
is a great tool in the tool set,

392
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,930
but it can't be the only thing we have.

393
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,770
And so that addresses the supply

394
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,500
of disinformation in many ways.

395
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,480
But on the other side of the equation,

396
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,660
the demand side of the equation,

397
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,690
Americans are often
searching for information.

398
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,600
So how do you make sure that
their information environment

399
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,409
has access to all of the
appropriate trusted sources

400
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,923
of information, election
officials in the election sector,

401
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,169
for accurate day, time, information

402
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,980
about how their election is administered,

403
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,780
what their security
practices and protocols are.

404
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,990
So we focused a lot of attention
on that resilience side

405
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,973
that supply side, or
that demand side, where,

406
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,270
how do you prevent the
information environment

407
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,660
from being overly distorted?

408
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,810
We're not trying to stop anyone

409
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,260
from being wrong on the internet.

410
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,220
We're just trying to make sure

411
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,590
that their information
environment is not so broken.

412
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,139
- Geoff, I think that, that
brings to mind kind of the PS,

413
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,710
the series of PSA's that
CISA and FBI had done.

414
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,470
And in kind of that
September, October timeframe,

415
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,910
right before the election,
where we were trying

416
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,160
to get out information
to the American public

417
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
where you might see this and,

418
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,980
or you might see these
kinds of false claims,

419
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,730
and this is what it really
means and you can vote anyways

420
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,450
and really trying to
get verified information

421
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,570
from both our agencies
out to the American public

422
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,453
so that they could make
some of those choices.

423
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,939
I think one interesting anecdote,
shifting gears for this,

424
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,620
like thinking about domestic
or foreign disinformation

425
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,899
is what the Iranians
did during the election.

426
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,340
Because what we saw them
do before the election is,

427
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,300
directly try to intimidate voters

428
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,879
and masquerading as a domestic actor.

429
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,430
What we saw them doing after the election

430
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,280
is threatening the lives on
websites of election officials

431
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,610
and private sector officials

432
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,520
or other US government officials.

433
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,853
And that too, it wasn't
labeled product of Iran,

434
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:07,990
it masqueraded as more domestic sources.

435
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,860
And I know one element that
both CISA and FBI tried to do

436
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,817
is get out public service
announcements to talk about like,

437
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,900
"Hey, this activity is Iran backed.

438
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,120
If you retweet from these handles

439
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,310
you're spreading Iranian disinformation."

440
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,310
And so really being able to
bridge the gap of helping folks

441
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,950
that doing information sharing
to help folks understand

442
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,020
where information is coming from

443
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,840
in addition to some of the activities

444
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,459
that Geoff was talking about
on the infrastructure side.

445
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,900
I think is really the way forward

446
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,100
and trying to look at
some of these threats.

447
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,909
- So Cynthia, I'm gonna
come right back at you

448
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,470
with a difficult question.

449
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,100
So Geoff talked about whack-a-mole

450
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,790
and you represent one of the agencies

451
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,950
that actually does
something outside of here

452
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,670
to solve some of that, how can we do more?

453
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,940
How do we,

454
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,200
I mean, this maybe isn't
a question of deterrence,

455
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,033
but what else can we do?

456
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,067
- So, and I think
there's two sides of this

457
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,420
and I can like, Geoff talked
through, maybe a little more

458
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,370
of the recommendations that we've put out

459
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,620
in some of the reports about
shoring up our election systems

460
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,379
overall, I'd sum that
up and we're not done.

461
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,680
We have to continue what we're doing

462
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,380
and get better at what we're
doing to make a difference.

463
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,380
But I guess what I worry
about is a 2022 or a 2024,

464
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,830
where adversaries believe they
can conduct these activities

465
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,780
with impunity, that
there's no consequences

466
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,530
or risks to conducting activities

467
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,889
that they're seeking to do.

468
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,650
And I think that that's
why director Ray announced,

469
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,410
the FBI director Ray announced
the new FBI cyber strategy

470
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,500
in the fall that really
centers on opposing risks

471
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,653
and consequences on cyber actors.

472
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,070
So I think it's really essentially about

473
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,629
getting some of these adversaries to think

474
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,050
to change their cost benefit analysis.

475
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,450
When they're thinking
about doing activities

476
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,500
in the first place and get
to the point of saying,

477
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,650
it's just not worth it.

478
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,380
Now that's a long game.

479
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,730
We're not gonna do one thing
and have that bit completed.

480
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,240
But there's ways in which every day

481
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,370
that we're working towards that.

482
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,169
And I think as we expand
on some of those activities

483
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,220
we really can make a difference.

484
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,650
One is what we've kinda
been talking about,

485
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,000
the information sharing,
the hardening of networks.

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,100
So adopting best practices
in cyber security

487
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,669
and US government getting information out

488
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,620
so that people can try to
kick actors off or block them

489
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,963
from getting on their
networks in the first place.

490
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,866
In addition, though, we
need to get into this detect

491
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:55,520
and deterrence framework really,

492
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,020
frame of mind, to be able
to make that difference.

493
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,650
And I think some of that is detecting

494
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,440
publicly attributing actors
like we did with Russia and Iran

495
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,540
right before the election.

496
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,680
Like, saying that if you do this

497
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,250
we're going to publicly
out what you've done

498
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,610
and the activities you're
conducting as well as working

499
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,639
with partners on
infrastructure take downs,

500
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,830
or other operations to try
to integrate those operations

501
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,663
in the first place.

502
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:24,740
So there's really a lot I think

503
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,680
that swirls under all of that,
but you can kind of put it on

504
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,990
through the banner of how
do we increase the risks

505
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,130
to doing this activity

506
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,570
and how do we increase the consequences

507
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,473
- Geoff, to add?

508
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,053
- I think it's a great challenge from,

509
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,710
there's always going to be
a segment of the population

510
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,340
that is going to reject the
message from the messenger,

511
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,659
that particularly when the messenger

512
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,243
is the federal government.

513
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,399
But the best that we
can do in many instances

514
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,150
is try to make sure that
the information environment

515
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,890
is not in great disorder.

516
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,312
So that those populations
that are undecided

517
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:07,189
about whether this piece of information,

518
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,930
this artifact of
disinformation is true or not.

519
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,150
Whether they have the opportunity
to find better sources.

520
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,280
So we're working with a
lot of election officials

521
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,072
on how are they tracking
their information?

522
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:23,169
How are they maintaining their,

523
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,740
basically standards of procedures

524
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,700
so that they can be as transparent?

525
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,670
How are they tracking it?

526
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,330
How are they testing against it?

527
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,560
And then how are they talking about it?

528
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,100
Chris Grubbs, then director
Chris Grubbs had his three Ps,

529
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,617
were trying a different letter here,

530
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:39,159
but it's these reactions.

531
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,550
How are you transparent about
all of the security practices

532
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,713
that you have to the point that
you can engender confidence?

533
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,159
You may not be speaking
to absolutely everyone

534
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,180
but hopefully you're reaching the people

535
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,470
who haven't decided to
be complete projectors

536
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,050
of evidence here

537
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,470
- And then Lester, adding
from the local level.

538
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,930
- So, yeah absolutely,
and we certainly support

539
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,430
and obviously there are certain activities

540
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,760
that local governments can't do.

541
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,830
And so we have to rely upon
our federal partners to assist,

542
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,840
especially when it comes
to being a deterrent.

543
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,840
So locals can't go rogue
and enact our own cyber war

544
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,970
of course, but we have a
responsibility as well.

545
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,380
And so one of the things
that we've tried to do

546
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,380
in Maricopa County is share
amongst our other local partners

547
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,409
with regards to our approach, our tactics,

548
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,350
things that we've learned, for example,

549
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,469
another example from a CISA perspective

550
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,500
is not only have we partnered with them

551
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,461
from a cyber perspective to take a look at

552
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:48,500
what our security posture
is, but also on the physical

553
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,240
or kinetic side, we've
actually had security advisors

554
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,630
from CISA do site visits to
validate the physical security

555
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,600
from an election's perspective.

556
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,909
And so we've consolidated
all that information

557
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,430
into specialized playbooks
along those lines

558
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,740
that address a number
of different scenarios

559
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,610
from a cyber perspective,
as well as communication.

560
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,080
And even before the actual
elections wrapped up

561
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,290
we shared that information freely,

562
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,810
obviously sanitized
with our other counties

563
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,669
in the United States
and other organizations

564
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,530
that Maricopa County participates in.

565
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,740
And so we as local governments need to do

566
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,510
collectively a better job

567
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,570
and have a more formal
stringent process in place

568
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,200
especially when it comes
to intelligence sharing

569
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,963
that we follow an execute.

570
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,500
One of the critical things

571
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,230
in terms of what Cynthia was talking about

572
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,200
for future elections, is
everybody needs to practice this.

573
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,290
So it's one thing to have it documented,

574
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,540
have your playbooks, but if
the first time you're looking

575
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,379
at your playbook is day of election,

576
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,620
then that's not the right tack to take.

577
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,879
So I'm happy to say at
least with Maricopa County,

578
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,290
that we have multiple tabletop exercises

579
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,960
involving a variety of different groups,

580
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,680
including our recorder for the County,

581
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,370
and then those playbooks

582
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,919
and that process and communication flow.

583
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Again, as Cynthia mentioned,
we'd share that information.,

584
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,180
We shared our playbooks
with CISA, with the FBI,

585
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,210
with the secretary of
state here in Arizona.

586
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,800
And so I would encourage in preparation

587
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,159
for future election cycles,

588
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,680
we need to share more
information at the local level

589
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,580
and we need to practice what
we're preaching as well, too.

590
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,310
So that way we're a well oiled machine

591
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,832
when it comes to the next election cycle.

592
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,850
- Yeah, touching on something
Cynthia said earlier

593
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,669
about the fact that it's continuous,

594
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,890
while the election security itself

595
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,320
is punctuated by specific
events of this election

596
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,270
and making sure that
we've effectively captured

597
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,030
the will of the voter for,
at the different levels.

598
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,170
It's continuous.

599
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,130
And so in the context of
what we're already doing

600
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,260
to plan for the next one

601
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,790
can you share a little bit more about that

602
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,149
as well as what we might expect

603
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,553
from different adversarial elements?

604
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,110
- Sure, so in the case of Maricopa County

605
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,939
we take a very iterative approach.

606
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,720
And so that's what we did in 2020.

607
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,980
So after each election
cycle, we did a hotwash.

608
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,710
We identified what observations we made

609
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,530
during that election cycle.

610
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,030
We factored that into whether
it's updates to our playbooks.

611
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,180
Additionally, we brought
on new technology,

612
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,350
won't go into specifics,

613
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,300
but we brought on additional capabilities

614
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,200
to do social media
monitoring, for example.

615
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,120
And so in our case, what
we continue to do is,

616
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,530
we continue to refine
our election playbooks,

617
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,840
our general incident response playbooks,

618
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,389
and then also our information
gathering and visibility.

619
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,260
So whether it's improving
our dashboard capabilities

620
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,200
in our sims, so that we
can more quickly pivot,

621
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,120
automate some activities,
so we're spending less time

622
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,110
doing basic intelligence gathering

623
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,590
and having that process automated,

624
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,709
and then continuing to
partner with our fusion center

625
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,280
and then communicate with regards

626
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,520
to how the communication flow was going.

627
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,280
Are we responding fast enough?

628
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,580
Are we able, if we can better identify

629
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,810
what those IOCs are that are
needed, et cetera, et cetera

630
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,490
then so much better with
regards to the efficiency

631
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,077
and efficacy on how we
interact with our state

632
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:40,343
and the federal partners.

633
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,003
- Cynthia.

634
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,990
- So, yeah, I think that the
lesson learned for all of us

635
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,970
was just how much we all need each other,

636
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,530
during all these election cycles.

637
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,480
And that's really where,
looking towards the future,

638
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,610
like what we really need to do

639
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,409
we need to keep the partnership strong,

640
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,350
and we need to keep talking to each other.

641
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,677
We can't look around and think,

642
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:08,040
"Oh, it's June 2022 I guess
we should start talking

643
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,500
to election officials again."

644
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,960
We have to really remain committed

645
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,280
to working with each other,
to the tipping and queuing

646
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,960
that we've had with election officials,

647
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,810
with the private sector,
continuing the conversation

648
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,860
with the American public about
what is foreign campaigns,

649
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,870
what we are seeing coming down the pike,

650
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,780
and I think really just
solidifying the work

651
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,180
that we've done to get
us to the point this far.

652
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,863
- Geoff.

653
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:40,670
- I completely agree with
Cynthia and Lester on this.

654
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,329
There are some areas where
we can continue to mature.

655
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:46,431
CISA is doing a lot of work

656
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,550
with the election vendor
community on supply chain.

657
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,330
We've seen supply chain
be another theme of 2020

658
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,860
in addition to pandemics and ransomware

659
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,830
and election security,

660
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,770
it's how do we help secure
the vendor supply chain

661
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,720
for which basically much
of the United States

662
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,420
is dependent on for the elections.

663
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,280
Beyond that working to,

664
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,649
again support local election officials

665
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,430
in the greatest extent possible.

666
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,440
There's other milestones
that are important.

667
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,600
The voluntary voting system
guidelines was just updated.

668
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,409
So by 2024, there may be new systems

669
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,340
that have additional security,

670
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,970
particularly around auditability
and software independence

671
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,559
that are going to be big accomplishments

672
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,540
in the ability to secure the sector.

673
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,373
A lot of work to do,

674
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,683
but there's progress in about every area.

675
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,250
- So Geoff, you mentioned
the supply chain,

676
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,440
and here we are speaking

677
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,870
at the largest IT security
conference in the world.

678
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,739
So the question to the group,

679
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,100
and we'll start with Lester,

680
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,230
is what would you ask of
attendees in their capacity

681
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,560
as information security professionals,

682
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,793
as well as that they are
all respective citizens.

683
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,970
- So, yeah, that's a great question.

684
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,790
And so I guess one of
the things I would ask

685
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,790
of the vendor community as a whole,

686
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,790
is an acknowledgement on
what the ramifications are

687
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,020
of their technology and their solution.

688
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,720
Understanding the shift in technology

689
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,930
and such that we have a
greater and greater dependency

690
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,150
on supply chain down the road.

691
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,830
Whether that's from an
operational perspective

692
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,550
or from an information
security perspective.

693
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,010
And so having the knowledge of
where those dependencies are

694
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,010
is critical in terms of delivering
a free and fair election.

695
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,110
In that the other thing
to keep in mind too is,

696
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,969
there doesn't actually have to be an event

697
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,570
that can cause a
disruption to the election.

698
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,500
It just has to have the
appearance of an event

699
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,280
if that makes sense, meaning, look

700
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,240
there's that saying
perception is reality, right?

701
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,550
And so we all collectively saw in 2020

702
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,639
that the vast majority
of what was communicated

703
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,239
whether it's social media
or even traditional media,

704
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,290
in some instances, just
frankly, wasn't true,

705
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,940
but it lent itself
towards giving the sense

706
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,280
that there was maybe some impropriety.

707
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,560
And again as Cynthia
and Geoff has mentioned,

708
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,400
there's no evidence of that
whatsoever across the board.

709
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,350
Yet there were,

710
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,819
Maricopa County was
sharpiegate, for example.

711
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,710
And that wasn't a thing.

712
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,050
And so vendors just need
to take into consideration

713
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,199
the sensitivity around their technology,

714
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,919
especially as it relates to the elections

715
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,683
and how just the perception of
itself could be a disruption.

716
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,083
- Cynthia.

717
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,420
- So, when I look back on 2020,

718
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,630
I just did so intensely proud.

719
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,997
The men and women across the
FBI who worked on this at CISA

720
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,660
in local and state election
officials, the private sector,

721
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,460
everyone coming together
and working towards this.

722
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,030
I mean, it was just,

723
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,560
it's such a moment that
you can look back on

724
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,393
for the rest of your life

725
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,500
and know that everyone in this space

726
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,380
really gave it their all
to get us to the point

727
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,330
that we're at today.

728
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,290
And so I'd asked kinda two
things of folks attending today.

729
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,610
One is continue to note
to the FBI and to CISA

730
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,070
when you see something suspicious,

731
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,340
so that we can investigate it, help you

732
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,880
and help everyone else in the
space and make everyone safer.

733
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Then number two, is that
if you've ever considered

734
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,493
joining the fight, I think now's the time.

735
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,780
FBI cyber is growing,

736
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,090
we are adding lots of different positions

737
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,210
and it's not just agents and analysts,

738
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,060
but it's data analysts, data scientists,

739
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,210
computer scientists.

740
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,260
I mean, you don't have to be
able to run eight minute mile

741
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,093
to join the FBI, right?

742
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,772
You can, you need to be
able to help us figure out

743
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:10,083
what to do with this 80 K or
80 terabytes of information.

744
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:16,240
But really, I think if
folks have that interest

745
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,060
in either working with or
working for our organizations,

746
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,160
you get to be something
bigger than yourself.

747
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,080
You get to really work
towards imposing the risks

748
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,850
and consequences on these actors that,

749
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,860
they don't think about doing
it, like the later years,

750
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,640
in these future election cycles.

751
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,833
And you can really beat that.

752
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,833
- And Geoff.

753
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,873
- Yeah, I couldn't agree
with Cynthia more it's,

754
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,340
come work for CISA (chuckles)

755
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,977
this has been the coolest
job, I've had the experiences

756
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:52,750
and the ability to
actually make a difference.

757
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,588
And, short of that, if you're
not willing to do a tour

758
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,230
with the federal government,

759
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,108
go talk to your election officials.

760
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:01,530
It took CISA years to begin to understand

761
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,940
how elections are actually
run, don't assume you know it.

762
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,070
Talk to them, don't pitch them services

763
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,820
until you understand the
position that they're in.

764
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,660
And then from there you
can figure out how to help.

765
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,259
They get a lot of solicitations.

766
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,323
What they want is assistance.

767
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,950
- All right, lightning
round to close it out.

768
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,799
You each have 30 seconds.

769
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,990
You had a magic wand, what
would you change in the system?

770
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,022
Lester first up.

771
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,810
- I probably would change the system

772
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,790
in such a way that there was
a greater sense of confidence

773
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,790
and transparency with
regards to the whole election

774
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,663
and,

775
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:44,580
what Geoff talked about sounds
pretty darn close to that.

776
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,860
So if we can hit that
stage, all we wanna do is

777
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,910
be able to provide this
service to our constituents

778
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,500
where they are 100%
confident that their votes

779
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,150
gonna be counted and it's
not gonna be tampered with.

780
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,453
- Cynthia.

781
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,830
- So I'm gonna ask for two wishes.

782
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,386
One is everything's patched,
and two though is that

783
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,780
Americans understand election systems,

784
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,220
just like kinda Geoff was talking about,

785
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,060
just like all of us have come
to learn it more and more

786
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,460
because once you learn about it

787
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,880
you really are able to
have a lot more confidence

788
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,893
in the conclusions coming out

789
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:28,773
from all various folks involved.

790
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,450
- And Geoff, take us home.

791
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,200
- The first one's easy, auditability.

792
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,919
We did a great job across the country.

793
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,000
I think about 93% auditability.

794
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,470
Those paper records are the evidence

795
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,879
by which elections will be convincing.

796
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,850
But the second is consistent
funding for elections,

797
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,500
so that they're not left
in the same position,
