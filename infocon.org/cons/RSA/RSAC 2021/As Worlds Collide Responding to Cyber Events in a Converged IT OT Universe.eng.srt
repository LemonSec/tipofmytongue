1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,580
- Welcome everyone to our talk today.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,410
I'm Matthew Dobbs and joined

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,290
with me is my colleague John Clarke.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,190
- Hello.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,770
- Alright, so we'll just jump into

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,620
what we're working on today.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,169
So with our agenda,
we'd like to talk about

8
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:22,660
what we need to do to
prepare to responding

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,340
to a cyber event in a
converged IT and OT universe.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,330
And first off, talk about a brief history

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,543
of what Industry 4.0 is.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,370
In 1784, the first weaving loom

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,440
began the industrial revolution

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,830
water and steam powered
systems were developed

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,629
to assist the plant workers
with mass production of goods.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,460
This increase in production
and efficiency and scale

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,270
allowed small businesses
to grow and begin to form

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,400
what we see is bigger corporations today.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,810
And then Industry 2.0
introduced electricity

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,870
into the system and
this brought the ability

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,149
to really implement mass production

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,433
further streamlining all
the processes and factories.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,550
And then industry 3.0 that
introduced electronics

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,800
including the first PLCs or
programmable logic controllers.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,110
This integration of electronic hardware

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,270
also saw the requirement
of software and firmware

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,119
to enable and control these devices.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,150
In a pressure to further reduce costs

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,300
many manufacturers moved
operations to low cost countries

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,840
and this dispersion of
locations gave birth

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,123
to the concept of supply chain management.

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,085
And then we move on to Industry 4.0.

33
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:50,089
With the boom of the internet
and telecoms in the 1990s

34
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,750
it really transformed how we connected

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,750
and how data and
information was exchanged.

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,620
This resulted in model changes
in the manufacturing industry

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,020
and production operations and
began to merge the borders

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,019
between OT and IT, the physical
and the virtual worlds.

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,550
The term Industry 4.0 was first introduced

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,423
at the Hannover Fair in 2011.

41
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,790
And so we'll mostly be concentrating

42
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,453
on obviously Industry 4.0 intersection.

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,450
And so next, there's a lot
of reasons why the IT and OT

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,890
worlds are colliding
or they're converging.

45
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,720
There's been an increase

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,740
in real-time data
observation and analytics.

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,970
And this real time data
processing is returning back

48
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,540
to the factory floor to provide
a positive feedback loop

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,450
to enhance process efficiency.

50
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,500
There's also taking advantage
of overlapping requirements

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,920
between the IT and OT
fields to take advantage

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,549
of unifying people in processes

53
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,120
such as inventory control,
prediction analytics

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,070
and supply chain models.

55
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,090
And of course, in our
current state of the world

56
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,550
remote access usage has accelerated

57
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,760
allowing people to work
remotely where they might not

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,410
have been allowed to work before.

59
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,270
And there's also been several
unintentional intersections

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,270
of the IT and OT world, many
cases of devices that make

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,100
it to the factory floor that
shouldn't have been there

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,470
plugging in personal devices
in the USB ports for charging,

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,670
streaming of music from HMI consoles

64
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,200
and even third party vendors causing

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,250
unintentional access and repercussions.

66
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,220
So as part of this convergence

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,710
the attack surface has
drastically increased.

68
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,920
And John, will you talk a little bit about

69
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:53,430
the evolution of malware?

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,620
- Sure, no problem.

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,380
So as Matt said, we have
this massive acceleration

72
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,290
towards Industry 4.0 and
digital transformation

73
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,320
and we see a parallel in the
malware attacks or the increase

74
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,560
in malware attacks as the
tech service itself increases

75
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,220
due to this transformation.

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,560
So we have some watershed moments for ICS

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,410
if we go back at least 10 years

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,430
we can see that Stuxnet,
which everybody knows about

79
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,000
which was an attack on
the Iranian nuclear plant

80
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,669
being the first also
to include PLC root kit

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,320
and targeting specific Siemens systems.

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,090
Around at the time were
using embargoed systems

83
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:38,210
and Siemens equipment and
therefore they may not have had

84
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,109
their patches up to date on those systems.

85
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,080
And therefore the attack
was allowed to spread

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,300
into that environment.

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,670
In 2012, we have Shamoon once again

88
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,700
we talk about IT/OT
convergence, phishing attack

89
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,150
and the initial access
into that environment.

90
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,282
Attackers then dropped
a logic bomb which wiped

91
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:59,270
almost 25,000 systems of
the Saudi Aramco plant.

92
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,510
And then we see a little
bit of a shift in 2014,

93
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,819
and we look at the Havex
malware, not so much destructive

94
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,819
or even the disruptive it's a
more so of an espionage tool.

95
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,230
And it's propagated via
a watering hole attack

96
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,503
specifically against ICS websites.

97
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,690
And so what was installed on the system

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,790
would scan the environment to locate

99
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,610
SCADA and ICS devices

100
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,060
and then they would send that
data back to the C2 server.

101
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,350
And then so like I said,

102
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,730
it wasn't disruptive or
destructive in any way,

103
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,330
but there's no doubt
that the data gathered

104
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,650
from the Havex still would
definitely be leveraged to design

105
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,020
and develop more destructive
attacks further on.

106
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,063
Then we move into energy
and we see Black Energy.

107
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,890
Discovered in 2014 in the US

108
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,540
no successful destruction on the US grid.

109
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,680
But since we talk about
evolution, we talk about 2007

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,190
Black Energy was a distributed
denial of service tool.

111
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,550
And now we see in 2015 that it's evolved

112
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,960
into a destructive malware causing

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,109
the world's first blackout in the Ukraine.

114
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,710
It was detected by ESET

115
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,099
and it was known to have multiple plugins.

116
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,610
And we talk about this
framework, this malware framework

117
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,530
and you could include delivery
of killdisk as a key logger,

118
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,599
password stealers, you
can take screenshots,

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,750
network discovery and you
could even update them malware

120
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,120
from the C2.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,470
Then in 2016, we see Industroyer.

122
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,550
At the time it was believed to
be the biggest threat to ICS.

123
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,650
Once again, it's a neuro malware framework

124
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,520
is reported to have being
used in the cyber attack

125
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
on Ukraine's power plant
again, in December of 2016.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,040
The attack cut out a
fifth of Kiev's power,

127
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,760
which is the capital city of the Ukraine

128
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,593
for at least an hour.

129
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,660
And it's considered to
be a large scale test

130
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,669
was said believed to be the biggest threat

131
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,660
since Stuxnet at the time.

132
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,020
And it's the first malware
that was specifically

133
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,400
designed to attack grids.

134
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,030
Then we go into 2017,
2018 and we look at Triton

135
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,299
another watershed moment

136
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,680
reported as the world's
most murderous malware.

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,250
And this is down to the fact
that it was designed and built

138
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,060
to disable safety systems,
which in themselves

139
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,890
were designed to prevent
industrial accidents.

140
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,700
It was discovered in Saudi Arabia

141
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,979
at a non-named petrochemical plant.

142
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,900
And it got its name from the
fact that it was targeting

143
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,969
the Triconex industrial systems

144
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,550
safety systems designed and
made by Schneider Electric.

145
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,103
So with all of this, there's
definitely gonna be a cost.

146
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,460
And so Matt you know, do
you want do you wanna talk

147
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,239
about anything in terms of criminal focus?

148
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,830
- Yes, so we'll move on to that.

149
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,320
So in 2020, it turns out
that manufacturing and energy

150
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,178
was the second most attacks industry

151
00:07:57,178 --> 00:08:00,570
up eight places since 2019.

152
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,570
And it's only behind
attacking financial services.

153
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,170
Ransomware is the top of
that attack list at 33%.

154
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,810
So the criminals are
starting to go where they

155
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,170
know the financial payouts will be

156
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,630
they are go into factory and energy

157
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,690
and even into medical
industries where they feel

158
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,840
that the victims are much more
likely to pay up the ransom

159
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
to get everything back
online and, you know

160
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,310
everything back up and running.

161
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,320
So that attack surfaces are
making it easier and easier

162
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,250
for these criminals to
target these OT systems.

163
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,970
So now let's talk a little bit

164
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,750
about the cost of all
this malicious behavior.

165
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,513
John if you would like
to discuss that for us.

166
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:47,660
- Sure no problem.

167
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,920
So when we talk about costs

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,089
I say it's not always about the money

169
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,210
there's definitely a
people factor when we talk

170
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,340
about costs in these attacks.

171
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,870
So a destructive attack
could no doubt result,

172
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,563
a sustained destructive attack
could result in job losses.

173
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,000
We talk about poisoning, you know,

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,250
we're kind of going for the
kind of out there scenarios

175
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,560
where you think that is it possible.

176
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,410
Yeah and we see that recently
where we have a close call

177
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,390
with the Florida Water Treatment attack,

178
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,400
which was possible because
there was a publicly accessible

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,530
port available for remote connections.

180
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,380
And the attacker connected
remotely and he raised the levels

181
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,450
while I say he but it
could have been anybody.

182
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,010
He raised the levels in
that sodium hydroxide

183
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,340
and luckily the plant manager
noticed that it was happening

184
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,250
and return the system back to normal.

185
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,210
And actually, what do you
see in the image on the right

186
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,910
there is a quick search using Showdown

187
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,910
I discover that there was
22,343 multiple protocols

188
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,770
accessible from the internet.

189
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,420
So that's me just doing a
quick search on the internet

190
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,990
and I could discover that
all of these endpoints

191
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,540
were accessible remotely.

192
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,170
Then we go into 2014.

193
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,219
We look at this blast furnace explosion

194
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,720
that happened in the German Steel Mill

195
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,670
spear phishing attack.

196
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,760
Again, once we see convergence of IT/OT

197
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,040
and the attacker got
access to spear phishing

198
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,250
was able to access the
systems that are utilized

199
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,370
for regulating the blast furnace
and cause extensive damage.

200
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,350
We also discussed previously
power grid blackouts.

201
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,103
We talked about Black Energy.

202
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,090
What can happen if there was
a sustained power grid attack

203
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,479
hospitals they run on power so
that they could be shut down.

204
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,530
We look at home medical devices,

205
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,470
food preservation, food could go off.

206
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,270
People could not get food in time.

207
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,970
If it was sustained attack on a power grid

208
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,909
it could be detrimental to society.

209
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,380
Then we go into safety
instrumented systems.

210
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,973
We talked about Triton previously.

211
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,699
Serious loss of life if the
safety systems are compromised

212
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,190
the only reason that
Triton wasn't successful

213
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,710
in 2017 and 2018 was because
the attackers made a mistake

214
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,530
and they actually turned
on the safety system

215
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,520
and allowed the systems shut down safely.

216
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,430
So they made it a little bit of a mistake

217
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,313
and the plant shut down.

218
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,859
Nuclear reactor meltdowns
that could be possible.

219
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,850
In 2016 a study was conducted

220
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,170
by the Nuclear Threat Initiative

221
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,530
they stated that nearly
half of all countries

222
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,069
that have relevant nuclear
facilities had no regulations

223
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,120
for service security at those facilities.

224
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,380
People we move on to money.

225
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,870
When we talk about money,
we can see there's a number

226
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,360
on this list here on the slide.

227
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,410
But I'm only gonna go
into maybe three of them.

228
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,400
First we talk about Duke Energy.

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,400
So Duke Energy are electric power company

230
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,880
and they had a fine put against them

231
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,730
by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation

232
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,220
for $10 million.

233
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,760
And this was in relation
to 127 violations of rules

234
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,240
that are designed to
keep US power system safe

235
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,150
from physical and cyber attacks.

236
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,490
Why do I mention this is because imagine

237
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,930
if any of those violations
that they were fined

238
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,959
for were exploited.

239
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,580
Imagine the cost could
have been way higher.

240
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,970
So luckily, they got caught early.

241
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,710
They probably fixed their issues.

242
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,543
Then we move into the year
of NotPetya, which is 2017.

243
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,829
One of the more relevant
kind of situations.

244
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,220
If we talk about today's
world and how we're going

245
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,220
through COVID we talk about
Merck Pharmaceuticals.

246
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,240
So there was a cost of
870 million to Merck.

247
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,670
And what happened was NotPetya

248
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,010
that infected their their
systems 30,000 close

249
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,390
laptops and PCs over 7,500 servers.

250
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,330
And they were a manufacturing facility

251
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,640
that supply vaccines for the US market.

252
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,250
And that was ground to a halt.

253
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,010
And so obviously with vaccines and COVID

254
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,069
and roll-outs at the top
of the world's agenda

255
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,790
and attack like this right
now could set a country back

256
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,120
in their program for sure.

257
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,270
Then we move on into one of
the really more notable ones

258
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,920
which is Norsk Hydro, the
metal and mining company.

259
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,060
And they were commented
actually for their response.

260
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,349
The reason for that attack was

261
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,020
the Lockergoga ransomware

262
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,300
and the ransomware Lockergoga
blocked the company's systems

263
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,160
forcing them to switch
to manual operations.

264
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,469
And they actually reverted
back to work arounds

265
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,300
and they utilized pen, paper,
fax machines, WhatsApp,

266
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,390
even Facebook.

267
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,660
So they utilized everything
at their disposal.

268
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,089
They had a message that was transparent

269
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,020
all the time to their clients.

270
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,939
So what I'm gonna do now
actually is I'm gonna show

271
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,507
a little bit of a curve ball here.

272
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:45,473
And so we're gonna
delve into gamification.

273
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,380
Most people may have heard about it.

274
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,480
Not a lot of people probably
know how it's utilized.

275
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,230
So when we talk about gamification

276
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,600
there's definitely three areas
that we wanna look at first.

277
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,640
And so one of them is
games and what are games?

278
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,733
So games are the likes of
Fortnite, Call of Duty,

279
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,520
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.

280
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,110
They're just kind of, I'm only naming them

281
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,520
because they're the ones
that I like to play.

282
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,350
And so game-based learning is where a game

283
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,590
is specifically created
to teach a discrete skill

284
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,803
or have a specific learning outcome.

285
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,000
So it's designed to
balance the subject matter

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,890
and with game play and
hopefully the player

287
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,110
participant can retain
that skill and apply

288
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,560
it in a real world scenario.

289
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,439
For instance and actually
at the time of checking,

290
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,060
it's actually down but Siemens
had a game called Plantville

291
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,010
which is currently not available.

292
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,830
And you could take control of a plant.

293
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,090
You could do the hiring, the firing

294
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,230
you could do the deployment of workers,

295
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,420
worker safety, worker satisfaction

296
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,829
and possibly show the
ability to improve process

297
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,400
and efficiency both purchasing
and installing the equipment.

298
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,956
And they are skills that you could utilize

299
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,630
on a factory floor or in a plant

300
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,850
and that's game-based learning.

301
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,280
And then we talk about gamification.

302
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,910
We're looking at application
of game design elements

303
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,530
and game principles in
that in a non-game context.

304
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,030
So sometimes these are defined as a set

305
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,829
of activities and
processes to solve problems

306
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,700
by using the characteristics
of game elements.

307
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,700
So we look at scoreboards,
points, badges, leaderboards,

308
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,870
performance graphs,
meaningful stories, you know

309
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,940
good storyline, avatars and teammates.

310
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,040
So how do we apply
gamification in the real world?

311
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,079
So in the real world, we're
looking at gamification

312
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,470
from the social, the
shopping, coding, education,

313
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,560
it's all around us.

314
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,790
It's in travel, it's in health

315
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,589
psychology plays a big
part of gamification.

316
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,170
So it'll trigger emotions
in us that are associated

317
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,522
with a positive, are linked
to a positive user experience.

318
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,660
You know, it gives us a sense of control.

319
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,300
You know, we don't like it as humans

320
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,810
we typically don't like
to be forced to drive

321
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,109
to our final destination that
will reinforce good behavior.

322
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,330
You think about likes on photographs

323
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,850
and comments on different
socials, you know

324
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,540
gives you a sense of achievement.

325
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,900
You know, you're learning
to code, you're getting fit.

326
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,160
You know, you're learning the language

327
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,100
it's competitive by nature.

328
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,080
And so setting a personal
best in your health goals,

329
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,690
for instance you can
compete against others.

330
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,760
You know, you look at the
health, for instance, you know

331
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,250
if you've got a Strava or Fitbit, you know

332
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,603
you can compete against your
colleagues or your friends.

333
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,250
And then also it allows us
to apply critical thinking

334
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,900
how you reacting to the pressure

335
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,329
and how we build up muscle
memory going forward?

336
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,060
And then we have maps
in terms of, you know

337
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,310
the ability to go to trivia game

338
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,910
is a major part of gamification.

339
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,040
So I talked about some
of the kind of aspects

340
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,339
of the real world in travel
collecting air miles,

341
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,440
shopping collecting supermarket coupons

342
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,260
on social you know, you go to Reddit

343
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,590
or Facebook or Twitter or any of those

344
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,210
and they've all got aspects
of gamification in them.

345
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,790
So when we talk about gamification

346
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,089
how do we apply it in the cyber world?

347
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,060
So in the cyber world, we
are creating tabletops.

348
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,319
You know, it's a scenario with
a serious business impact.

349
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,990
We have attendees and
they actively respond

350
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,970
as if it were occurring in real life.

351
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,819
And then you would review

352
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,530
and disclose how things
went through the tabletop

353
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,089
and then how things
could have gone better.

354
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,663
And then you can rerun
that again or another time.

355
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,620
Can be very specific

356
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,830
and it's highly interactive and engaging.

357
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,710
We talk about war games, you know

358
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,480
live for events for IT/OT
and the business teams.

359
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,890
You know, you can include
your PR, your legal,

360
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,490
your SOC, CSO, HR everybody's involved

361
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,780
comms, you know, it's like a cyber cluedo

362
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,700
you know, are you trying to figure out

363
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,790
who performed an attack

364
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,760
to who, what, where, when and why.

365
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,070
And then we have capture
the flag competitions.

366
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,860
So as we talk about this
digital transformation

367
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,229
and the convergence of IT and the OT

368
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,970
we also need to be driving
that unified skillset

369
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,650
and language in terms of our universities

370
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,550
and our high schools because traditionally

371
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,750
we would be kind of gearing
towards the IT world,

372
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,890
preventing of threats
and stuff in the IT world

373
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,210
but we need to kind of focus moreso

374
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,300
driving a unified message
with capture the flag

375
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,720
and may be difficult to
influence a curriculum

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,410
in a university but providing a safe place

377
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,520
like a capture the flag
competition can be a great way

378
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,770
of engaging students and tech teams alike.

379
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,480
I may have built many CTS over the years.

380
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,890
There are an awesome
networking space where

381
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:50,510
the business can learn from the students

382
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,290
and the students can
learn from the business

383
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,600
and it can even be
utilized as a hiring tool.

384
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,070
And then we've got a cyber range.

385
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,439
This is the playground for all things.

386
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,510
The benefits of a cyber
range is very immersive,

387
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,590
it's engaging, it's hands-on, you know

388
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,610
you can inject pressure
into the environment.

389
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,370
You know, you can set up your own use case

390
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,929
and build around that.

391
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,430
So on the effectiveness of
gamification is the fact

392
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,270
that we learn by doing so when we talk

393
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,920
about to build a game or
a simulation or a scenario

394
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,490
you need to understand who the players are

395
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,130
and what the roles and responsibilities

396
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,740
that they would undertake
in that environment.

397
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,340
So I think Matt, if you wanna take us

398
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,399
into the responsibilities
that'd be awesome.

399
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,430
- All right.

400
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,490
So what John was saying
is we need to understand

401
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,160
who all the players in the game are.

402
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,000
And a complete scenario would
include an entire business

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,900
including HR, comms, CSOs, business owners

404
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,560
things like that but for today
we're just gonna concentrate

405
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,560
on the players who are
the IT and the OT teams.

406
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,600
And we also need to understand

407
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,219
that they have totally
different perspectives

408
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,160
or maybe not totally but
a lot of different goals

409
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,660
what their business goals are.

410
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,520
For example, IT they wanna
keep all the data confidential

411
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,040
where OT wants to keep
everything running above all else

412
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,409
or keep everybody alive and safe.

413
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,080
So each team has their own
set of objectives, timelines,

414
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,399
language, standards, you name it.

415
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,750
And this can drive a wedge
between the IT and the OT teams

416
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,600
when it comes to their
day-to-day activities

417
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
and their long-term goals.

418
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,520
And then also OT can
sometimes see IT security

419
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,250
as a job stopper and
a job killer, you know

420
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,250
some other differences are OT
needs very mature technology

421
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,810
that they know can last 10 years, 20 years

422
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,399
something that's well-established

423
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,400
where IT can have a little leeway and do

424
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,750
you know, cutting edge
technology even, you know

425
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,180
looking for open source
solutions and things like that

426
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,990
where OT absolutely they can't do.

427
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,170
And these types of
differences can be exacerbated

428
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,150
in the time of a cyber crisis.

429
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,320
And this is where gamification
can help us identify

430
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,850
and ultimately remedy the functional

431
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,562
and philosophical differences
between these teams.

432
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,090
And in the game you would try and involve

433
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,270
the entire businesses part.

434
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,790
But once again, we're just gonna to talk

435
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,220
about the IT and the OT teams.

436
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,160
And so John, will you talk

437
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,410
to us a little bit about
setting up the game?

438
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,090
- Sure no problem Matt.

439
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,030
So, as Matt said, you know

440
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,820
the different perspectives
of who our players will be

441
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,429
and how do we go about
setting up the game for these.

442
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,860
So like with any scenario we
need to understand our people.

443
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,760
We need to understand that process

444
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,867
and we need to understand that technology

445
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,240
and in IT and OT world,
these are quite different.

446
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,650
So we need to create our informant based

447
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,530
around their differences and try

448
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,100
and get them into an understanding.

449
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,500
So how did we go about
setting up the game?

450
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,530
So we create our teams, we set them open

451
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,950
and we equip them with the technology.

452
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,600
So if you think of a game like
Call of Duty or Rainbow Six

453
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,205
I've given away my secrets
here at the games I play

454
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,230
but you look at your loader
for a mission, you know

455
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,400
everyone is working towards the same goal

456
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,100
or within the mission or a win

457
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,340
within that same mission hopefully.

458
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,879
What if there's a
breakdown in communication?

459
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,170
How is that gonna impact
the outcome of the mission?

460
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,740
You know, so a lot of
the people, the process

461
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,750
and the technology information
that can be gathered

462
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,260
beforehand via an interview
to establish the perspectives

463
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,830
of each of the teams or individuals

464
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,840
that are gonna be involved in the event.

465
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,100
We can also decide the goals
and the structures of the teams

466
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,439
and the event at that point.

467
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,430
And the thing about it
is the goal is not always

468
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,390
defined who the threat actor is.

469
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,660
You know, let's uncover
who did this, you know

470
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,100
although it is a great
part of it, you know

471
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,179
it should be much bigger than that.

472
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,810
The goal really should be can
we find gaps in our people,

473
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,730
can we find gaps in our process

474
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,910
and can we find gaps in our technology.

475
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,070
So when we talk about setting up a game

476
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,070
I'll just step into a
little kind of scenario

477
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,660
or an example of what that is.

478
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,490
So let's take the aspect
of setting up the game

479
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,370
and we talk about budget
and resource allocation.

480
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,350
These are gonna be definitely different

481
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,783
for IT versus the OT world.

482
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,850
They may think differently about how

483
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,240
where the budget is gonna go.

484
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,180
So one of the very first things we do

485
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,530
when we're saying what the
game is you allocate some funds

486
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,350
and you decide between you as a group

487
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,469
where the resources and
where the money is gonna go.

488
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,980
So are we gonna invest in
our security personnel?

489
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,090
Are we gonna invest heavily in
training, technology or more?

490
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,639
And so what we do then is
how much is the difference

491
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
between the IT and the OT.

492
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,850
You got to choose your path.

493
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,820
Are you gonna buy, are you gonna build,

494
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,909
are you gonna deploy your solutions?

495
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,730
So you could set up the game with a budget

496
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,970
and depending on where it's allocated

497
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,610
could impact the outcome

498
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,530
based on the decisions
you make previously.

499
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,740
So this is how we would set up the game.

500
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,690
Matt, do you wanna talk to us
about how the game plays out?

501
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,433
- Absolutely.

502
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:25,150
So next, we would talk
about response procedures

503
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,833
and how that maps to
playing the game itself.

504
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,960
So understanding the response procedures

505
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,960
from the different
organizations is just like

506
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,393
we had mentioned from their
perspective, it's different.

507
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:42,540
IT can respond to an
outage by simply rebooting

508
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,253
or reinstalling or arming a
device to get a system back up.

509
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,080
You know, they probably even
have well-established backup

510
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,100
and recovery processes
that they can schedule

511
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,469
a maintenance window on a, you know

512
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,380
Saturday night and practice
these types of scenarios.

513
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,080
But OT has a lot less
opportunity to perform such tasks

514
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,812
or have that easy of
an ability to remediate

515
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,572
any sort of situation like that.

516
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:16,480
And then responding to the cyber incident.

517
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,703
You know, this difference
can be magnified.

518
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,660
You know, if there's incident
forensics data needed

519
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,210
on an IT system it's relatively
easy to get a snapshot

520
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,030
of the hard drive and
then reimage the system.

521
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,399
But in an OT world, there may not be a way

522
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,030
to gather that data for
forensics analysis or, you know

523
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,270
there's pressure to get
the factory floor back

524
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,240
up and running, just reload
the firmware and let's get go

525
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,393
and you lose that important
bit of information.

526
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
And so IT and OT teams are
constantly putting out fires.

527
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,690
It's what they do in their
day-to-day operations.

528
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,670
If somebody loses a
laptop or it doesn't boot

529
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,440
there's well established
procedures for doing that.

530
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
And then practicing a response plan

531
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
is a lot like a fire drill.

532
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,780
You need to know where
the fire extinguisher is.

533
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,250
You need to know where the exits are.

534
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,850
You need to know what the exit plan

535
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,050
is but when a fire turns into a disaster

536
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,500
you need more than just the firefighters.

537
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,790
You need EMT, you need
police, you need HAZMAT

538
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,889
you need all of these
teams that come together

539
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,790
and fight the disaster
and recover it from it.

540
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,110
And it's very similar

541
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,910
in the IT and OT as well as business roles

542
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,450
to have this sort of this dance

543
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,250
that they perform effectively to respond.

544
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,780
So everybody needs to know, you know

545
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,190
when you're in a disaster
zone or a cyber disaster

546
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,990
teams need to know what their jobs are,

547
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,250
they need to know what
other team's jobs are.

548
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,630
They need to have effective communications

549
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,970
or else everybody's just
kind of got to get in the way

550
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,270
of each other and potentially
make the disaster worse.

551
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,980
And then, so John if you
wanna talk a little bit about,

552
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,390
you know how mapping can help
out as part of gamification.

553
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,930
- Sure, so as Matt
briefly touched on there

554
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,250
he talked about the
runbook in the playbook,

555
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,063
and that is like a map or a
guide in your response plan,

556
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,370
as to how you would deal
with a certain situation.

557
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,300
Unlike in any game, for instance

558
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,860
like Call of Duty or Fortnite

559
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,110
playing without a map or a
heads up display is pretty tough

560
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,320
I would say in terms of, you
know what's the next objective?

561
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,281
Where is the weapons?

562
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:42,950
where am I colleagues?

563
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,680
So we utilize a runbook similar

564
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,680
to how we would have map or
a hood in the game, you know

565
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,190
so you've completed a task

566
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,130
and you need to get to the next location.

567
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,860
What's the path, you know, in
a response you complete a task

568
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,350
and the runbook may dictate
what the next course

569
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,209
of action is.

570
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,670
In a game or simulation it's okay

571
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,530
'cause you can make a wrong
move as long as we're learning

572
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,340
from those mistakes that
we make along the way.

573
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,879
And in cyber simulations,
like we should fail

574
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,540
and we should fail often
and we should find our gaps.

575
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,409
And so the path in a game or in real life

576
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,790
it's not always a straight line

577
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,530
and there will be roadblocks
and we need to utilize

578
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,700
your critical thinking to change the path

579
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,193
or to move the obstacles out of the way

580
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:27,230
and all the while training
your muscle memory.

581
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,300
And so a runbook is basically
like your guiding map

582
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,300
to get through and navigate a scenario.

583
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,820
And also there's other maps that utilize.

584
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,679
And we talked about like,
it may also be beneficial

585
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,850
for you to map your environment

586
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,199
with the MITRE ATTACK framework for ICS.

587
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,200
And so once we have our setup
and our players and our maps

588
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,409
what are our objectives
and what are our tools

589
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,320
Matt that we're gonna
utilize as we go forward?

590
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,169
- So today we're gonna talk
about security visibility.

591
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,330
Each organization has
their own very specific set

592
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,580
of tools their people,
their processing technology.

593
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,699
So from a high level
overview, we'll talk about

594
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,253
security visibility that
encompasses all of those things.

595
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,206
And so you know, you've got
your OT team, your IT teams,

596
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:19,077
your security teams as well
as your, your CSO, your CFO

597
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:23,163
and the other technical leaders
within the organization.

598
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,140
And as part of this visibility

599
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,990
through the game, you'll
find out do you have

600
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,750
the visibility everywhere
that you think you do

601
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,730
that you need, you know

602
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,790
help share what those
risks are to the team

603
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,350
especially if you have a
risk-based security policy.

604
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,570
And as part of that game we're showing

605
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,870
how we can effectively do that between

606
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,320
all of these different teams

607
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,820
that are playing this game, you know

608
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,439
like I said, what are the risks?

609
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,400
How do they show the data
and how do they communicate?

610
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,470
And now, so for the game to be successful

611
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,710
there needs to be repeatability
in order to identify

612
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,810
and remediate any of
these gaps identified.

613
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,649
And if John, if you'll
talk about that for us.

614
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,871
- Sure, no problem.

615
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:15,820
So as Matt said, there
needs to be a repeatability

616
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,700
of each scenario or each session.

617
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,290
And that way you can identify
and remediate any gaps

618
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,960
in your people, your
process or your technology.

619
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,930
And so that's possible through

620
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,340
the building of a simulation
with a specific use case

621
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,790
in mind that may be
something that you feel

622
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,860
like is really high up on the
agenda for your organization

623
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,909
and that you're concerned about the most.

624
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,460
So you would build out
a sandbox environment

625
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,650
that would replicate as realistic

626
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,930
an environment as possible
or as is feasible.

627
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,270
And then you would run, you would test

628
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:52,310
and you would recycle again, you know,

629
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,159
so you're basically training the player

630
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,470
and you may even wanna
change the game at some point

631
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,550
you know, to kind of put a
little bit of a curve ball.

632
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,990
So the goal here really is
to test different aspects

633
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,120
of the teams.

634
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
So you wanna be looking
at your treasure hunting,

635
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,340
your analytical skills, you
know, you wanna be looking

636
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,230
at adaptability in a scenario, you know

637
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,370
critical thinking, the usage
of tools to complete tasks

638
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,300
and aptitude of a participant.

639
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,010
And this is the place to
fail and to make mistakes

640
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,690
to fail early fail often,
like we always say, you know

641
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,340
you can observe but don't
let your first worst day

642
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,649
be in the real world during a real event

643
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,900
you need to allow yourself
to have numerous worst days

644
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,400
in your buildup to an
actual real worst day.

645
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,773
So we combine all of this together.

646
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,320
What have we got?

647
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,250
So we have identified
a use case to simulate

648
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,883
something that's associated
with your organization.

649
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,170
We have, for instance it could
be a ransomware on the HMI

650
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,163
the attackers come through the OT.

651
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,287
So we're talking about that
convergence again, you know

652
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:05,320
and how do we get the messaging
going between the two teams.

653
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,210
We need to identify the
tools to play the game.

654
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,580
Matt talked about security
visibility, you know

655
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,860
do we have security monitoring
in that environment?

656
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,060
You know, what kind of tools do you have

657
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,460
on your OT side of the house?

658
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,080
We identify our players.

659
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,810
So we talked about security
as an organizational issue

660
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,629
and not just for IT, you
know, so we need a fusion team

661
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,150
and there we need our IT,
our OT, or comms, our legal

662
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,920
and then we need to
practice the communication

663
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,870
between all of these teams,
more specifically on IT and OT

664
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,449
because they don't really
speak the same language

665
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,283
at the moment.

666
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:41,042
It's very vendor based protocol for OT,

667
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,439
IT is very open source biased technology

668
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,200
you know, cutting edge,
moving with the times

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,880
and then we need to practice
communication between IT and OT

670
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,960
and the business to deliver
that unified messaging.

671
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,780
And once again, we talked about exercising

672
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,030
the muscle memory, you need
to fail early fail often.

673
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,860
And so the goal of the game really

674
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,270
is to have the business
practice their own processes

675
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,290
and technology and to
find gaps and edge cases

676
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,060
that they did not
anticipate during the design

677
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,960
and implementation phases of
their security architecture.

678
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,740
Yeah, it's great to have the game

679
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,260
and you also get bonus points

680
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,690
if you find a threat actor
but really what we wanna do

681
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,120
is test people, the
process and the technology

682
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,743
and find those gaps in our setup.

683
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,970
And so Matt think if
you wanna quickly drop

684
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,540
into our conclusion.

685
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,879
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

686
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,880
- Yeah as the introduction
of these new technologies,

687
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,580
particularly edge
computing cloud resources,

688
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,220
industrial internet of things

689
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,390
and especially 5G technology

690
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,650
is making it to the factory
floor are absolutely

691
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,780
accelerating this convergence.

692
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,440
And with this convergence

693
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,660
the threat actors will also pivot

694
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,700
and take advantage of these changes.

695
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,400
And we see where gamification is the fun

696
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,320
and effective way to keep pace

697
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,130
with the future needs of the security

698
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,363
and the business in a
converged IT/OT enterprise.

699
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,920
And John, you wanna talk
about some takeaways for us?

700
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,810
- Sure.

701
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,029
So well, what we want you to take away

702
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,210
from what we've just spoken about.

703
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,310
So definitely next week, if
you haven't already done this

704
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,600
you should definitely do
some kind of lunch and learn

705
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,730
with your IT, OT teams, get them talking,

706
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,080
get them discussing
issues that they're having

707
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,132
in their informants,

708
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,540
get them connected with each other

709
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,110
and get them connected
with each other quickly.

710
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,780
You know, it need to be a virtual exchange

711
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,290
between these two worlds.

712
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,820
And then further down the line

713
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,239
maybe in the first three
months, following from this

714
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,299
we wanna see people design and
create a tabletop experience

715
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,949
it's supposed to previously, you know,

716
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,310
pick a business problem
and build it around that.

717
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,049
And then test, find the issues

718
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,300
and then maybe go back
again and visit it again.

719
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Involve all the
perspectives of the business

720
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,610
about IT and OT in all of these journeys.

721
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,030
And then maybe further on and on

722
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,520
you need to request a
budget further training

723
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,740
and simulations like a cyber war game

724
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,000
or you may wanna build
a capture the flag event

725
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,850
or more tabletops.

726
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,740
And then within six months
you should definitely

727
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,169
be practicing organization
policies and procedures

728
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,530
within these simulations.

729
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,390
Test out your governance, you know

730
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,877
checking the risk on both teams, you know

731
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:34,403
and you need to stress test your runbooks.

732
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,720
Definitely within the first six months.

733
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,580
Otherwise, like I said,

734
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,860
you don't want your worst
day or your first worst day

735
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,150
to be in the real world
when it actually happens.

736
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,270
That's it for me, Matt.

737
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,378
Thanks.

738
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:50,211
- All right.

739
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:51,740
Well thank you John, and
thank you everybody else,

740
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,149
and at this moment we'll take questions

741
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,790
and thank you for participating.
