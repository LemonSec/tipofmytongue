1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,465
- Good afternoon, all
my name is Nick Tsamis.

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:05,100
I serve as an adversary
ambulation engineer

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,670
with the MITRE Corporation.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,090
I'm an aerospace safety
engineer by background,

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,960
turned cyber engineer by trade.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,820
I have spent my entire
cybersecurity career

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,510
in operational technology,

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,800
primarily in industrial control systems

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,250
where I've worked to further
cybersecurity capabilities

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,727
into our civilizations,
critical infrastructure.

11
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:24,260
In my current role, I
seek to push the science

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,160
of how cybersecurity is
used for adversarial effect.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,660
My focus remains on
operational technology.

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,990
That is where computing and
physical systems interact.

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,823
I wanna thank RSA

16
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:36,920
for putting on a great
conference this year.

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm excited to be
speaking to you all today

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,320
about increasing the resiliency
of our Space infrastructure

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,640
by way of increased
insight into 5G operations.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,100
This presentation will cover
concepts that are paramount

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,316
for an effective strategy.

22
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,950
As we look to monitor

23
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,370
for cybersecurity implications
in our 5G infrastructure.

24
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,839
And I hope that the
concepts will be useful

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,500
for you to take away to your enterprise,

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,250
be your Space operator or otherwise

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,153
a user of 5G networks.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,220
For brief overview of some of the concepts

29
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,600
we'll talk about today,

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,890
and keeping up with
RSA's model of educate,

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,291
learn, and apply, wanna
provide a background

32
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,350
on the advent of 5G.

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,759
How we're using it today,
how that's going to change

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,958
in the future, or
introduce the architecture

35
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,539
and some of the surrounding
core philosophy that was baked

36
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,710
into 5G from the get-go.

37
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,179
We present two different
conceptual threat models

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,530
that are not intended

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,290
by any stretch to be a
holistic representation

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,429
of a threat model, but
highlight two diverse areas

41
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,868
that are both critically
important for us to ensure

42
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,520
that we're building holistic
monitoring strategies

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,039
as we implement these
capabilities into our networks.

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,980
And we'll talk about how we can approach

45
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,371
some of the existing challenges

46
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,366
with current technologies today.

47
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,600
Further then we'll talk about
some existing challenges

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,009
that we're actively working on tackling,

49
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,780
where current technologies don't provide

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,503
a current drop-in solution.

51
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,274
Finally, we'll discuss
how we can take away

52
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,851
some of these concepts
and near term actions

53
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,238
on how we can use and
apply these capabilities

54
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:16,313
in our current roles, wherever
you reside in the enterprise.

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,030
So to provide a brief
backgrounds on 5G in general.

56
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,627
In a Space 5G network,

57
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:27,380
we're increasingly reliant
on Space-based capabilities

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,180
namely Space vehicles, or satellites.

59
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,210
Communication here, terrestrial
based on earth is increasing

60
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,436
and reliant as we allow those
communication capabilities

61
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,232
into more and more endpoints,

62
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
and more and more functions
of our daily life,

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,914
similar to how IOT has really transitioned

64
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,380
the way we do business

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,590
and the way we execute
our daily operations,

66
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,200
so too, will 5G present
a challenge for us.

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,209
A couple of domains where
5G is really being pushed

68
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,385
for increased efficiency,
increased communications

69
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,536
and otherwise better operations.

70
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,567
In critical infrastructure,

71
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,253
the agriculture industry
is a good example,

72
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,760
certainly with emergency response.

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,690
As we develop mitigation strategies

74
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,507
and otherwise response
capabilities for natural disasters,

75
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:17,993
5G is certainly an
enabling capability there.

76
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,015
Everyone's well aware of the
advent of autonomous vehicles

77
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,459
and how 5G can bring low
latency communications

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,500
into self-driving cars, or
looking at increased mobility

79
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,654
in urban environments

80
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:34,790
potentially with UAS as
an example in the future.

81
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,933
And as we're all well aware

82
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,829
how IOT has really
changed the way we do work

83
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,883
in the enterprise or how
we do things at home,

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,541
5G will continuously push the extent

85
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,733
of how those increased
communication capabilities

86
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:54,733
are allowing functionality
to further the edge,

87
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,083
if you will, to our end point devices.

88
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,359
There are three primary facets of 5G

89
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
that we'll talk through.

90
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
And the bottom of the figure
here, these are the end users,

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,040
generally referred to
as UE or user equipment.

92
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,511
A good example of this is the iPhone

93
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:13,069
that we all carry around on a daily basis.

94
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,485
Other examples here include
planes, trains, automobiles

95
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:20,293
as we are increasing the
communication ability.

96
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,104
So to does that connectedness

97
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:25,460
and allowing 5G go directly to the device

98
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,989
rather than through some
federated network capability

99
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,753
in the enterprise as a whole.

100
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,063
As we move up in this image,
the kind of 5G network

101
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:38,700
is it really broken down into
two separate capabilities.

102
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,114
The first is what is
referred to as gNodeB.

103
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,919
And this can be identified.

104
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,680
It's really the gateway into a 5G core

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,450
which is really where the
5G network components live,

106
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,283
if you will.

107
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:55,690
GNodeB is really just a
set of relay capability.

108
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,777
So my iPhone has an endpoint

109
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:00,919
can connect to either a
terrestrial based tower

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,910
and that's communication
gets relayed into the 5G core

111
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,300
potentially a terrestrial
based 5G core also,

112
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,760
or my end point may directly communicate

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,710
with the gNodeB satellite,
which then gets relayed

114
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,368
into a core from a wireless perspective

115
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,193
a radio access network.

116
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,400
Then the 5G core at
the top of this diagram

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,510
is really where all of the
5G network components live.

118
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,270
Two of the core facets
of 5G are the premise

119
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,728
that it's based on
software defined networking

120
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,760
as well as network
function virtualization.

121
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,300
And while we have proven the
utility over the past decade

122
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,970
of these capabilities
for increased efficiency

123
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,340
better operations, reduce maintenance.

124
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,500
What it does is also
presents unique challenges

125
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,770
that we need to consider

126
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,849
as we seek to monitor these networks.

127
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,350
The entire premise of network
function virtualization

128
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,100
allows for decentralized and
decoupling software functions

129
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,210
from the innate hardware
that they traditionally

130
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,818
have been relied on.

131
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,810
So now I can deploy potentially
one function on prem

132
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,245
and use cloud capabilities
or partner sites

133
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,630
to host additional capabilities.

134
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,430
We lose sometimes visibility

135
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,750
into where those functions
are decentralized too.

136
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,652
And it's important for us
as we're trying to monitor

137
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,810
where these data flows
are ultimately residing.

138
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,020
It's important for us
to be sure we understand

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,140
where those functions live.

140
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,380
Why we should care about this advent

141
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,100
in this increased 5G use,

142
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,950
is that again as we become
increasingly reliant

143
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,900
and as satellites increase
our terrestrial coverage

144
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,510
if you will, allowing
5G to go to the edge,

145
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,320
it's imperative that we build security

146
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,650
into the user equipment, the
communication profiles we use

147
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,929
as well as all of the
infrastructure that really

148
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,315
supports 5G communications
at the end of the day

149
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:04,990
it's not simply a Senate
and put it into orbit

150
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,650
but from a monitoring perspective,

151
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,570
it's important that we
understand the implications

152
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,420
of those controls.

153
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,351
Have they been actually
implemented appropriately

154
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,005
and do they provide the security

155
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:19,033
and or visibility that we expect them to?

156
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,574
And finally, it's no
secret in cybersecurity

157
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,440
that it's not a question of if

158
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,433
but when cybersecurity
incidents will happen.

159
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:31,360
In the face of an incident
response and recovery

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,310
is critically reliant on
monitoring capabilities

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,930
that is getting insight

162
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,224
to responders from either a malicious act

163
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:43,397
or otherwise a non-malicious
environmental issue.

164
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,650
Having monitoring that
provides data to responders

165
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,989
is imperative for quick mitigation

166
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,293
and restoration of services.

167
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,770
I'll present the first concept
of the threat model here

168
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,192
but I wanna provide a little background

169
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,093
on the figure that's described.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,620
The figure that we see here
is from the three GPP spec,

171
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,550
the high-level system architecture.

172
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,749
And it's not important to understand

173
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:14,600
every single acronym
here, but at a high level,

174
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,580
this depicts the different microservices

175
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,378
that comprise the 5G core.

176
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,120
The UE box is user
equipment that we talked

177
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,130
about prior in the bottom left.

178
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,381
And the attack scenario
we'll talk through here

179
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,440
from a threat perspective
is as a traditional

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,360
or well-known understood,
understood attack vector

181
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,919
where the adversary is
going to directly attack

182
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,838
the link between user equipment
and the 5G network itself.

183
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,755
In this case the user
equipment is connecting

184
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:46,863
to a Space vehicle relay,

185
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:50,574
the adversary can
directly attack that link.

186
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:55,084
And if un-encrypted the
adversary can either spoof

187
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:58,260
sniff the traffic or
otherwise try and gain access

188
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,163
to the user equipment
itself or moving right

189
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:05,222
into the the Space vehicle
and further compromise

190
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:10,030
or otherwise interact with
services in the 5G core itself.

191
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,420
One thing I do wanna
call out at this point

192
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,439
is that it's not necessarily
an appropriate representation

193
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,160
to just say there are 4G networks
and there are 5G networks.

194
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,106
a more accurate representation
is really viewing

195
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:23,010
that as a spectrum.

196
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,470
And why that's important
is that as we are updating

197
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,855
or increasing the capability
from 4G or LTE networks

198
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,357
into 5G capabilities,

199
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:34,920
oftentimes that's not
a single light switch

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,469
where it's flipped over directly.

201
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,720
There are certainly
instances where standalone

202
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,150
or SA, 5G 5G architectures are built

203
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,329
but more often what we're seeing are NSA

204
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,690
or non-standalone architectures.

205
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,790
That is we're upgrading pieces

206
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,599
of our 4G or LTE infrastructure

207
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,170
and increasing the capacity
or functionality of 5G.

208
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,810
Why that's important to
understand is that legacy

209
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,232
attack vectors may be carried over

210
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,880
as we're implementing
new 5G functionality,

211
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,713
maybe carried over

212
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:12,510
from our existing 4G
or LTE infrastructure.

213
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,939
It's important to understand them

214
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,918
that's if we haven't
necessarily flipped over

215
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,140
all the capabilities required

216
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,830
for some of the new 5G security features,

217
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,290
and there is a whole suite of
security features to be added.

218
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,067
Not all of those are going
to be usable on day one

219
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:32,420
when we start with a new 5G network.

220
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,750
So it's important to understand

221
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,705
that some of the baggage we're bringing

222
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:40,110
may indeed still present challenge for us

223
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,431
in vulnerabilities or
otherwise attack vectors

224
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,883
from how we execute networks today.

225
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,010
In this case, the adversary
is directly affecting

226
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,290
or otherwise attacking
the 5G network itself.

227
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,426
So it's imperative that
monitoring be focused

228
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:58,484
around the links for
the satellite operations

229
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:02,435
in order to ensure that's
appropriate and authorized use

230
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:07,262
from that UAE to the
satellite is indeed occurring.

231
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,890
From a network perspective,
that makes a lot of sense.

232
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,723
We can monitor that link

233
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:13,370
and see the communications there

234
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,376
but I do wanna call out one
box on here, that's AMF.

235
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,420
AMF box accessibility
and mobility function

236
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,490
is the first core service
that's really used

237
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,070
by user equipment,

238
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,800
once it is gained access into the core.

239
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,632
And why that's important to understand

240
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:35,563
is that if we remember the
concept of that virtualization

241
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,709
of these network functions
allows for decentralization

242
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,580
or potentially us losing track

243
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,020
of maybe where these functions
are, are actually being run.

244
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,338
It's important that if we were
reliant on that AMF function

245
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:52,439
from an endpoint or logging perspective

246
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,810
and that's a critical piece of monitoring

247
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,609
for my security operations center

248
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,530
or in order to execute
some incident response

249
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,390
I need to know where
that functions running

250
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,400
and how to appropriately
get that data back,

251
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,040
if I am doing logging on that function.

252
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,005
So as we talk about the
increased efficiency

253
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,910
and the increased capabilities that NFV

254
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,230
and otherwise SDN allow for us,

255
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,230
so to do the challenges
exist for implementing

256
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,500
an effective and holistic
monitoring strategy.

257
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,750
In this case, we really need to know

258
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,343
where all of those functions
aren't deed running.

259
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:33,160
The second, except we'll talk through

260
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,969
is not necessarily on
the 5G network itself

261
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,980
but on the supporting infrastructure.

262
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,280
And the threat concept
that we'll talk through

263
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,900
the adversary isn't directly
touching the 5G network

264
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,095
could potentially be downstream
effects to it certainly.

265
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,756
But what we're really interested in

266
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:55,100
is the supporting C2 infrastructure

267
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,123
on the Space vehicles themselves.

268
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,410
When we talked about the first
concept for threat model one

269
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,290
in the 5G network, there
are two primary data planes

270
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,610
that the adversary can affect.

271
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,780
The first being the user plane,

272
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,550
that is if I have my iPhone here

273
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,982
and I download a file over a 5G network

274
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:18,550
that file is being presented
over the user plane.

275
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,165
There's a second plane in this instance,

276
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,090
that is referred to as the control plane

277
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,559
in which all of the kind
of network optimization

278
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,050
or otherwise network routing,

279
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,723
and mobility tracking capabilities

280
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,165
are occurring generally
unbeknownst to the user

281
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:35,759
at the end of the day.

282
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,608
Both of those data planes are in context

283
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,550
for the concept of threat model one.

284
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,382
In this case,

285
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,710
we're attacking a separate
data plane altogether.

286
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,032
That is the data plane that is reliant

287
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:51,032
or responsible for maintaining
satellite operations.

288
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,760
The satellite itself does
certainly contain an ingress

289
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,200
into the 5G network, but
there's a secondary network,

290
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,720
that's important to consider

291
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,100
from a Space operations perspective.

292
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,619
And this is the command and
control network that's used

293
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:09,060
in real time to keep satellites in orbit

294
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,459
and to collect telemetry on health status

295
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,010
or otherwise diagnostic data.

296
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,500
In this case, an adversary interested

297
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,820
in affecting the Space
operations themselves can attack

298
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,750
through a Space C2 center.

299
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,170
Oftentimes this is part
of the ground segment

300
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,479
for Space control and being
able to issue potentially

301
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,520
spurious satellite control actions

302
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,240
can certainly directly
affect users that are reliant

303
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,540
on real-time communications
to that satellite.

304
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,340
If a low latency application is reliant

305
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,759
and has locked with, or has
a communication flow directly

306
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,320
with that satellite modifying the orbit

307
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,815
otherwise orientation
certainly has drastic impact

308
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:58,265
on that communication flow.

309
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,228
We'll talk a little bit
more in detail later on

310
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:02,219
but it's also important to understand

311
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,363
that while these two networks
are generally isolated

312
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,273
it's important for us to validate

313
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:12,040
that the adversary that's
affecting the control network

314
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,136
for the satellite itself
may or may not be able

315
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:16,780
to pivot over to the data plane.

316
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,370
We'll talk about some of the controls

317
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,170
and considering it's a bit later on.

318
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,155
So understanding that we present
a reference architecture,

319
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,670
just to kind of put on the map,

320
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,459
what are some of the core components

321
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,838
that we need to consider

322
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,988
from a holistic monitoring perspective?

323
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:38,570
In this use case, we'll talk
through a satellite operator

324
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,856
who's providing 5G network services.

325
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:45,650
The assets box in the bottom here

326
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,579
contain some of the different assets

327
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,080
that we effectively would
want visibility into

328
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,730
in order to pipe those into an
integrated seam, if you will

329
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,370
or otherwise common operating picture

330
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,173
of what cybersecurity looks like.

331
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,316
Some examples of that data
include, as we mentioned

332
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:04,490
the Space vehicle itself, the satellite,

333
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,870
there's a whole host of data

334
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,350
around the RF spectrum that
we would want to understand

335
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,690
if somebody is trying to deny

336
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,589
or degrade our signal or inject directly

337
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,000
from an RF perspective
into our communications

338
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
that's all information
that we would wanna pull

339
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,849
from the satellite domain, if you will.

340
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,280
Front end processors

341
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,230
are generally communication capabilities

342
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,520
that translates and allow
for operators on ground

343
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,270
to speak with with ground-based antenna

344
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,290
in order to communicate with satellites.

345
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,900
So logs on potentially data streams

346
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,531
or otherwise anomalous
capabilities or occurrences

347
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,120
on the front end processor are important

348
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,090
for logging capability there.

349
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,923
And as we move more

350
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,090
into than the ground
control network itself

351
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,210
oftentimes we see more
traditional IT capabilities

352
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,090
windows servers, commodity Linux servers,

353
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,110
certainly within satellite networks,

354
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,980
there are commodity hardware
and software components,

355
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,903
and we would certainly
want to be able to build

356
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:06,903
monitoring capabilities to
those specific technologies,

357
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,837
but there is a whole host

358
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:13,730
of oftentimes standard capabilities

359
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,679
that we can leverage
today to get good insight.

360
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,560
As with normal enterprise today,

361
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,879
mobile and cloud often do
provide some kind of role

362
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,823
in satellite operator
and networks as well.

363
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,020
As we move up from assets,

364
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,936
it's important to understand

365
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:36,919
that we tangibly need to
get all of these data flows,

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,810
these logs, these network
communications, for instance,

367
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,094
into some centralized integration piece.

368
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:45,473
For the use case described here,

369
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,411
the elastic stack is often used
as a as a common integration

370
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:53,200
and otherwise analytic platform.

371
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,750
Dashboards created in cabana

372
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,891
can show some of these
integrated data sets

373
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:01,088
as they are combined into
the elastic backends.

374
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:03,610
It's important to understand what sensors

375
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,129
or what type of tooling we can leverage

376
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,430
across all of these different
assets and data sources

377
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,040
to effectively integrate
so we can coordinate

378
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,010
and otherwise correlate
these data sources.

379
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,980
We talked about
traditional IT capabilities

380
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,940
some more standard Linux or
windows servers, for instance,

381
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,103
we have well-defined tooling

382
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,390
and we have well-defined formats.

383
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,950
Oftentimes we can drop in and
drag and drop a parser in,

384
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,793
or otherwise a connector
to get some immediate value

385
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,439
out of that.

386
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,840
As we move more into the bespoke hardware

387
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,327
or software that is generally present

388
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,840
in satellite operations networks,

389
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,300
for instance from a front end processor

390
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,709
or from an RF spectrum monitoring machine

391
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,227
we have less ability to just
kind of drag and drop in

392
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:56,500
a generic solution.

393
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,810
Oftentimes the the tooling available

394
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,471
is not nearly as readily available

395
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:04,777
as some of these other more
standardized capabilities.

396
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,772
So that's a large challenge
when we're thinking

397
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:11,139
about how do we get
information from those assets?

398
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,060
What is the required censoring or tooling

399
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,790
that I need to potentially
build or customize

400
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,472
in order to get that
common operating picture

401
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:21,120
from the integration perspective.

402
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,433
So what's clear across,
just identify a couple

403
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,019
of the different asset classes here,

404
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,148
is that it's imperative for us to monitor

405
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:32,361
across the full spectrum
that is network traffic flows

406
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,580
seeing the command, seeing the telemetry,

407
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,210
but also getting point
data from windows servers

408
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,490
and potentially correlating
those for increased visibility

409
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,253
and increased operational
knowledge across the mission.

410
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,476
Everything we've talked about

411
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,720
to this point from dashboard
on, down in the picture

412
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,460
is under the purview of
the satellite operator.

413
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,974
The final concept we'll introduce
is what happens external

414
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:57,100
to that 5G provider.

415
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,454
This is where the concept
of ISAC information sharing

416
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:02,430
and analysis center comes into play.

417
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,980
So ISAC is a sector specific
information sharing center.

418
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,100
They're not non-profits
member-driven organizations,

419
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,526
and generally they are
comprised of entities

420
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,081
in the commercial industry.

421
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,610
This is important, especially in Space

422
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,821
as we're seeing the advent of
increased commercialization

423
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:24,290
and less public utility in Space.

424
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,735
It's really important
that the ISAC represents

425
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:31,736
and appropriate body of those players

426
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,120
that are actually present in the industry.

427
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,598
The real intent is to help
facilitate information sharing

428
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,780
across all of those stakeholders.

429
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,810
And a key facet of that is
increasing the collaboration

430
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,280
between government and industry partners.

431
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,860
The Space ISAC itself really serves

432
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,108
as a single point source for data

433
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:55,179
and otherwise information
around the security and threats

434
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,570
to Space assets,

435
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,189
provide information on all
threats, certainly cybersecurity

436
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,880
is a paramount consideration of that,

437
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,630
but we really look to the Space ISAC

438
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,697
to be that designated body
that has all of the information

439
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,462
around threats to the Space sector.

440
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:15,341
As a member of a Space ISAC,
you're not only contributing

441
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,540
to the collective benefit
of the entire Space domain

442
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,170
by the information that you contribute

443
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,290
or otherwise share to the ISAC.

444
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,859
But one of the benefits
then is being a user

445
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,973
of that information that is analyzed.

446
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,370
Specifically for the Space domain

447
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,429
we're dealing with generally
increased timelines,

448
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,619
increased distances.

449
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:36,544
There are a lot of unique challenges,

450
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,539
and oftentimes early warning

451
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:42,400
is a very critical consideration.

452
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,460
So the earlier that I
can be in my mission,

453
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,550
the earlier that I can be tipped off

454
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,230
to something potentially going wrong

455
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,242
or something that I should
really try and head off

456
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,399
as early as possible,

457
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,300
I can really potentially
reduce the mission impact.

458
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,515
So having a federated pipe

459
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,870
and an immediate communication channel

460
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,409
to easily and efficiently
transfer information

461
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,225
that the ISAC provides

462
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:07,094
is a critically important enabling factor

463
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:10,770
for commercial entities in the Space.

464
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,800
Membership is generally
open to anyone interested

465
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,100
in the security of the
sector specific ISAC

466
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,350
that you're working with.

467
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
So welcome back to what we talked about

468
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,625
with a certain set of assets
that is the Space vehicle.

469
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,090
With the rest of the assets that we talked

470
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,360
about from a reference
architecture perspective,

471
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,996
we generally have a pretty good handle

472
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:35,097
on how we can pull logs,

473
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:40,097
how we can otherwise get
logs or network traffic

474
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,770
appropriately parsed appropriately
formatted and integrated

475
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,698
into some standard IT
cybersecurity stacks.

476
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:51,380
The barrier to entry, however,
is significantly higher

477
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,418
when we're talking about
Space vehicle communications.

478
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:57,570
If we revisit the point we talked

479
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,429
about with the first threat
model, the Space vehicle itself,

480
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,925
really is providing two different sets

481
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,794
of network communications.

482
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,540
One is the 5G network itself.

483
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,560
In this case, providing
multiple gNobeB entry points

484
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,790
to the 5G core backbone,

485
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,220
and the second is represented

486
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,730
in the bottom of the image here,

487
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,230
from a command and telemetry perspective.

488
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,311
That Space vehicle is on
the network pulling commands

489
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,730
in real time, as well as
feeding down a telemetry

490
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,150
and diagnostic information
to Space operators.

491
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,300
That's important consideration
from a security perspective,

492
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,000
there are a whole host of
considerations and controls

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,230
that are generally put in place to isolate

494
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,453
those two networks.

495
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,233
Certainly what we wanna do

496
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:50,639
with monitoring is ensure the
validity of those controls

497
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,980
and make sure that the controls

498
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,610
are not either bypass, compromised,

499
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,019
or just straight up
ineffective and implementation.

500
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,630
But the secondary consideration

501
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,030
around that is if these networks
are effectively isolated

502
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,470
and we treat that as such,
this increases the complexity

503
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,670
of my monitoring infrastructure.

504
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,770
Not only do I want to be able to monitor

505
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,118
what's occurring on the 5G network itself,

506
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,462
but I also want to capture information

507
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:18,360
on the command and telemetry data.

508
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,729
So really what that does.

509
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,679
It puts the burden on
the operators themselves

510
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,720
to correlate two different
sets of information.

511
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,901
Oftentimes we can certainly
timestamp the data,

512
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,440
once we integrate that,

513
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,470
we can correlate the information that way,

514
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,370
but an important physical consideration

515
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,989
that needs to be thought of too,

516
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,960
is that as satellites are orbiting

517
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,330
there's generally
intermittent communication

518
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,701
with ground stations.

519
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:45,657
Oftentimes the satellites
used for 5G networks

520
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:48,639
are in orbit and not geostationary.

521
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,001
And that's important consideration

522
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:54,177
that I'm not going to
have necessarily 24/7 eyes

523
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:55,858
on my satellite.

524
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:59,181
Even if I did we need to consider
the bandwidth constraints.

525
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:02,817
Certainly swap seat is an
important consideration

526
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,533
with Space vehicle construction

527
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:08,240
and bandwidth constraints are
awfully often quite limited

528
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,230
over the current command
and telemetry link.

529
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,503
So the takeaway here is that
this provides a challenge

530
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:17,862
for operators to correlate
those two data sets

531
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:21,568
both from a collect the data
first, but then what do I do,

532
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:25,879
and how do I effectively
integrate those two data sets

533
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,917
into my common operating picture

534
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,297
for cybersecurity implications.

535
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:32,691
Future work here would
certainly benefits the ease

536
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:36,346
and the integratability
of these two data sets

537
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:38,800
into more common cybersecurity tools

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,082
like a Splunk or an ELK
stack, for instance.

539
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,953
So moving beyond.

540
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:48,910
So I want to talk about
responsibility for 5G security.

541
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,662
Certainly it follows that
everyone that has a stake in 5G,

542
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:58,335
inherently has some type of
responsibility for the security.

543
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,540
Government, certainly plays a role

544
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,052
in developing policy to ensure

545
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:06,560
that we can secure these systems,

546
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,800
and that we can enable
security within these systems,

547
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,841
just like the FAA does for
aircraft, for air worthiness,

548
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:15,900
it's important that the
government would play a role

549
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,259
to ensure trusted access
as well as fair use

550
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,730
and acceptable use of these
systems moving forward.

551
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,050
Space, however, presents
a unique challenge

552
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,120
in that it is an international domain.

553
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,399
So as nations are defining policies

554
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,350
for what acceptable use looks like,

555
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,310
it's important that we consider

556
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,550
that those policies
ultimately need to be welcomed

557
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,550
and accepted by or otherwise
interface with other nations

558
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,123
to form a an appropriate
international policy.

559
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,875
Moving on to Space system operators,

560
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,380
they have a piece of the
responsibility by here

561
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,380
that is ensuring command and
control of their Space vehicles

562
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,233
are accessed and maintained
by authorized individuals

563
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:06,272
ensuring that the security
of that control network

564
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:11,272
is paramount, really
has a important effect

565
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:13,442
to the availability and the integrity

566
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:16,100
of the 5G network itself.

567
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,439
As 5G is inherently reliant
on Space-based capabilities,

568
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,290
so two is it on Space system operators

569
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,000
to maintain the availability

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,828
of those Space-based capabilities.

571
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:31,956
5G network operators then,
they share the responsibility

572
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:34,279
by ensuring secure communication

573
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,440
between the ground and Space

574
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,614
as well as capabilities
within the 5G core.

575
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:44,354
If we remember back to
the kind of spectrum

576
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:48,750
of 4G LTE networks into 5G networks,

577
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,290
it's important for network
operators to be aware of

578
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,378
and understand that if we're not operating

579
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:59,970
in a standalone capability,
some of the 5G security features

580
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,425
may not be available to end users,

581
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:06,480
and may not be available
for increased visibility.

582
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
The baggage that we're
potentially carrying

583
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,600
from current 4G or LTE networks
must be well understood

584
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,990
as we're integrating

585
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,600
and moving more towards 5G only networks.

586
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,899
And finally, to talk about the consumers

587
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,262
really the end user.

588
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,589
These are the folks that, again,

589
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:25,566
I download a file on my iPhone.

590
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:29,853
I am the end user operating
that user equipment.

591
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:34,218
End users would certainly be concerned

592
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:36,913
with privacy implications

593
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:40,060
as we are allowing 5G capabilities

594
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,611
and more functionality
into our daily lives.

595
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,067
It's important that we understand

596
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:47,727
what the privacy implications are.

597
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,332
Oftentimes security is an
enabling factor for privacy

598
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:54,530
certainly with different
intent at the end of the day

599
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,633
but both our core facets and
from a personal perspective

600
00:28:57,633 --> 00:29:02,140
it's important to enable
the user to make an informed

601
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,680
and ideally a risk informed decision

602
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,710
by knowing how they are
allowing 5G into their lives

603
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,826
and what potential risks
they might be allowing

604
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:13,693
by doing that.

605
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,810
Certainly as we move 5G capabilities

606
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,700
into more critical applications,
the efficiency gains

607
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,490
of moving towards autonomous
vehicles for instance

608
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,520
or robotic manufacturing,

609
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,150
where some of these
applications rely on low latency

610
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,416
or potentially high bandwidth coms,

611
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,691
we should be aware of the criticality

612
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:43,000
of the functions that we're
allowing 5G to have access to.

613
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,250
And it's important that we weigh that risk

614
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,834
versus reward ratio and
consider the implications

615
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:52,013
of 5G security and how they may affect

616
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:56,003
some of our safety critical
operations and functions.

617
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,022
So moving forward, some
immediate actions we can take

618
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:02,879
if you're a Space operator

619
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,669
or a 5G network operator, for instance,

620
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:08,182
devoting resources and
identifying really where

621
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:13,182
out of band monitoring
solutions would not only enhance

622
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,680
but also integrates

623
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,175
with your current situational
awareness picture.

624
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,837
Building additional capabilities

625
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:23,360
and integrating those into a
more common operating picture

626
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,288
for a holistic monitoring solution

627
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:28,163
is a very important consideration.

628
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,170
Certainly considering the
participation in the Space ISAC

629
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,160
as both a contributor to
the Space domain as a whole

630
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,186
as well as a user of the data feeds

631
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:45,464
that the ISAC provides is
an important consideration.

632
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:50,100
As more members join ISAC in general,

633
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,735
so to does the common
strength of the information

634
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,710
that we're able to share.

635
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,710
Increased visibility is
really the concept that allows

636
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:04,580
for a more efficient and more
effective information sharing

637
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,572
within the domain.

638
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,900
Then a little bit further off

639
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,980
is considering how once we've
built those capabilities

640
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,620
how do we use that information?

641
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,517
How do we use that monitoring capability

642
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:18,260
that we've implemented

643
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,017
in order to identify certainly baselines

644
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,070
on what network assets

645
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,419
and what network
communications are occurring

646
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,509
and ultimately being able to track down

647
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:30,099
what communications
should not be occurring

648
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:33,283
or being able to more acutely define

649
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:36,703
how behaviors are occurring on trusted

650
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:40,399
or potentially untrusted
devices on the network.

651
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,520
I do wanna make sure that's
it's important for users

652
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,777
to take away that this
is not just a challenge

653
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:52,777
presented to Space operators
or to 5G network operators.

654
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,288
As 5G is increasing to end point devices

655
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:00,404
in our homes and in our workplaces

656
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:03,903
it's important that we
understand our reliance today,

657
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:06,130
and how that reliance will change

658
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,360
over the next three, six
12 months in the future,

659
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,534
and how our business
operations will change

660
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:16,220
in order to be dependent
on those 5G services.

661
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,755
From that perspective,
similar to the paradigm shift

662
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:22,970
we saw with cloud computing,
this is going to change

663
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,480
the way we need to do
cybersecurity defense

664
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,520
and otherwise cybersecurity visibility

665
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,870
into our operations.

666
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,379
So being able to identify
business objectives

667
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,990
or otherwise system requirements

668
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,216
where 5G is the infrastructure of choice,

669
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,347
is an important consideration

670
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,750
that everyone can take
back to their personal life

671
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,123
as well as the enterprise
in which they work.

672
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,351
In wrapping up, the two
threat models we presented

673
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:56,352
are intended to provide specific
insight into two different,

674
00:32:56,672 --> 00:33:01,490
very diverse attack paths that
we should certainly consider

675
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,576
as core tenants of a
holistic monitoring strategy

676
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:07,898
for 5G moving forward.

677
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:11,560
Being able to use what
we talked about here

678
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,444
in identifying potential use
cases for increased monitoring

679
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:17,930
and potentially how external feeds

680
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,250
such as what Space ISAC provides

681
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,950
is an important consideration to think

682
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,630
how that can enhance an organization's

683
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,450
current situational awareness.

684
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,998
And being able to act on that,

685
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:33,520
we should be able to then inform a better

686
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,006
out of band monitoring strategy,

687
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,507
that's more holistic to incorporate

688
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,120
some of these additional threat factors

689
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,580
that we've talked about,

690
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,126
and secondarily consider
feeding back as a contributor

691
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:49,530
to the Space domain as well
as a user of Space information

692
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,013
coming from the ISAC as a consideration.

693
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,450
I thank you all for the time

694
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,980
and appreciate the ability
to speak with you all today,

695
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,830
and I really look forward

696
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,424
to addressing the
challenges we talked about

697
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:02,703
with the community as a
whole moving forward here.

698
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,010
Thank you very much.
