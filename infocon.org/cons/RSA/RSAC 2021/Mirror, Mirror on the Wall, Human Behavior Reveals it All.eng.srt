1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,410
- Hi, I'm Margaret Cunningham.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,070
I'm a principal research scientist

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,843
for human behavior at Forcepoint.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,320
By trade I'm an applied
experimental psychologist

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,850
who specializes in measuring

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,059
and understanding human behavior.

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,550
Today, I'm going to talk
about how human behavior

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,463
can be used to better understand
organizational resilience.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,180
Mirror symbolized truth, which as we know

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,690
can be challenging to establish

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,680
in the world of cybersecurity.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,940
In this field, we are beholden to a range

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,320
of technological solutions
that provide representations

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,110
of networks, devices, people,

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,053
and processes to name a few.

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,490
These solutions can also be manipulated

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,410
and result in a distorted truth

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,720
of our organization's ability to identify

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,490
and protect against internal
and external threats.

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,780
As we increasingly depend
on technological solutions

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,260
to represent a world of
information, we often fall victim

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,099
to dichotomous thinking where
good versus bad determinations

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,140
are hardwired into our risk assessments

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,693
and decision processes.

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,179
The reality is that there is
a great deal of nuance and art

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,290
within the scientific

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,343
and engineering heavy field of security.

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,350
You should know that I'm a psychologist.

29
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,610
I believe that people rather
than technology hold the key

30
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,320
to understanding and
addressing the many nuances

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,223
that exist in the
information security domain.

32
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,230
For instance, people imagine
and build the technologies

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,530
that make cybersecurity possible,

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,000
but also introduce various
risks due to human limitations.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
People are the forces that can bolster

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,480
or alternatively destroy an
organization's capabilities

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,503
and resilience.

38
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm also biased in that I
believe that most people are good

39
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,130
while also recognizing
that on rare occasions,

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,360
we come across individuals
who are not very good at all.

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,460
I also believe that many people
fall somewhere in between

42
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,860
and that these people may in
fact be the most resilient

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,203
and simultaneously risky people
within our organizations.

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,770
They're creative and adaptable,

45
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:10,500
and in these traits, lie
behaviors that may be at odds

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,063
with an organization's goals.

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,240
Today, I'm going to discuss how
understanding human behavior

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,170
is a critical component for
addressing security issues

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,530
that continue to impact

50
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,923
organizational performance and resilience.

51
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,160
I will highlight how to use observations

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,780
of specific human behaviors to identify

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,460
and subsequently address systemic issues

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,503
that exist within our organizations.

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,769
My goal is to illustrate how
when things are going well

56
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,400
and an organization is high
functioning and resilient,

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,150
people make fewer
mistakes, break fewer rules

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,860
and engage in fewer
insider threat activities,

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,110
which ultimately means that

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,313
an organization's security
stance is vastly improved.

61
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,920
I also hope to illustrate how

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,709
when things are not going very well

63
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,780
or during periods of
high stress or change,

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,290
we the opposite behavioral
trends, which ultimately means

65
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,222
that an organization's
security stance is diminished.

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,900
At the end of this presentation

67
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,120
I hope that you'll walk away
with a new understanding

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,100
of how valuable understanding behavior

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,950
and the context around behaviors is

70
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,410
to your organization's
overarching security strategy.

71
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,500
In this talk, I'm going
to do three things.

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,720
First, I'm gonna walk through
a human centric systems model

73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,070
that I've developed
specifically to help people

74
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,930
in the cybersecurity industry
better grasp the importance

75
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,863
of people within their
systems and organizations.

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,640
Second, I'll use three different
insider threat scenarios

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,299
to illustrate how we can
use the model to interpret

78
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,790
observable behavior and to
identify systemic issues

79
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,000
impacting adverse security outcomes.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,230
Third, I'm going to talk about
what organizations can do

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,910
to improve both organizational
and individual resilience

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,270
and their ability to protect

83
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,370
and secure their assets more successfully.

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,470
This human centric model draws from

85
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,970
the existing systems theories

86
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,180
macro ergonomic work systems analysis,

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,370
I know it's a mouthful,

88
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,450
the human factors analysis
and classification systems,

89
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,470
and one of my favorites,

90
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,090
which is the humanistic systems theory.

91
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,950
What these models all have in common

92
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,329
is that they focus rather
heavily on human beings

93
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,200
and how humans behave
within their environments.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,340
I also want to note that when I say model,

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,950
I mean something that is
comprised of different components

96
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,530
boundaries, processes,
influences, and perspectives.

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,010
In this instance, I also
believe that the components

98
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,289
of this model have the ability
to be changed in some way

99
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,893
that can yield improvements.

100
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,240
The components that I will
be talking about today,

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,210
are the human component,
implicit components,

102
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,859
organizational components

103
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,710
and one that I've grouped together as,

104
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,643
proximity perspective and relationships.

105
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,930
The human component focuses
on observable human behavior.

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,020
How we observe behavior is in
part determined by the sensors

107
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,430
and technologies that we have in place.

108
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,470
When we have the correct
tools we can determine

109
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,960
what people are interested in,

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,210
as well as their habits and proclivities,

111
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,349
even typing patterns offer ways

112
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,053
to create behavioral
signatures for individuals.

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,280
It's also imperative
that when interpreting

114
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,039
observable behavior we consider
individual differences.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,920
People are born with, or
learn from their environments

116
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,470
unique and enduring traits.

117
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,860
These traits include things
like personality, culture,

118
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,510
beliefs, attitudes, biases,
aptitude, expertise,

119
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,727
the list goes on.

120
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:38,169
And these unique individual
factors also influence

121
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,120
how we process information
from our surroundings

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,823
and in turn, how they
influence our behavior.

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
In security the human component

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,415
is where we see the mis-click,
the accidental share email.

125
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,670
I have to say, I've
definitely emailed a file

126
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,840
to the wrong person because

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,075
the email name auto-filled for me.

128
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,800
It happens all the time.

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,340
So it's also where we
might see other things

130
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,349
like evidence of dissatisfaction

131
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,393
or even evidence of data
stockpiling and access click.

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
The implicit component is
a little bit different.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
The implicit component includes

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,740
immediate environmental
factors, including external

135
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,890
and internal dynamic states.

136
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,979
So these are interpersonal issues

137
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,610
and human plus technology
issues to get it started.

138
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,160
This includes interfaces in
our technological environment,

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,830
time pressure, workload,
social interactions,

140
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,810
and emotional responses.

141
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,490
It also includes what
we're planning on doing,

142
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,050
what we're using and where we are.

143
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,910
It could be immediate situations

144
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,510
and it can also include
something like an emergency.

145
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,530
Implicit components can be challenging

146
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,270
because they're hard to see in data.

147
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,830
They're also not necessarily
very straightforward.

148
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,159
For example, while we can see
physical environmental factors

149
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,480
actually measuring their impact on people

150
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,370
or people's performance
is much more challenging.

151
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,920
That said implicit factors are very real

152
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,820
and they have a large
impact on real outcomes

153
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,173
and on people's behavior.

154
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,909
In our world of security,

155
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,990
practitioners are extremely
familiar with burnout,

156
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,230
alarm fatigue, isolation, stress.

157
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,930
They also know that these
factors impact their ability

158
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,670
to do their jobs.

159
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,970
And these factors can
have a negative impact

160
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,680
on their personal lives.

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Generally speaking, almost
everyone experiences

162
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
distractions, interruptions, fatigue,

163
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,943
and social issues at work.

164
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,049
The software and hardware that we use,

165
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,050
how we access assets
while working from home,

166
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,060
these are all things that fit under this

167
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,863
fairly large implicit component umbrella.

168
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
And while we might be
aware of these factors,

169
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,429
they're hard to see in the data,

170
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,888
but we need to do a
little bit of a better job

171
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,580
of understanding how
they feed down through

172
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,050
the more explicit human component factors

173
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,483
like observable behavior.

174
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,943
The organizational component
encompasses culture.

175
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,770
The organism beliefs, assumptions, values,

176
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,680
and ways of interacting both
internally and externally

177
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,600
build the social fabric of a company.

178
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,290
For instance, some organizations

179
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,410
have a very hierarchical culture

180
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,400
while others have a more
casual open door culture.

181
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,579
There are other organizations
that pride themselves

182
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,900
on having a culture where
employees based their identity

183
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,299
on their role or on their
association with the brand.

184
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,189
Culture pretty commonly starts at the top.

185
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,440
And it is in many instances driven by

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,243
what types of behaviors are
reinforced by leadership.

187
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,670
So interestingly enough,
there are a lot of things

188
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,880
that we can track and
measure when it comes to

189
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,860
organizational culture and
other organizational factors.

190
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,550
We can look at resource tracking,

191
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,400
different plans for
processes and improvements.

192
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,860
We can review policies and rules.

193
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,330
We can even read a mission statement

194
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,093
and look into the public branding.

195
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,660
In security, the organizational
component is critical.

196
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,740
This is where we end up
determining how much money is spent

197
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,170
on security and how it's
allocated within that space.

198
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,520
It's also the place where we tend to see

199
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,970
what types of policies
will be put in place

200
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,733
to manage our users of data.

201
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,950
So it's a pretty big deal to keep track

202
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,300
of what's going on at
the organizational level.

203
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,560
So leadership, including overarching plans

204
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,829
for addressing information,
security, processes,

205
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,890
plans and product acquisition,
have an enormous impact

206
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,640
on an organization's
security posture and culture.

207
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,449
Many of you here today may
actually be very aware of

208
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,800
or feel the direct
impacts of this resource

209
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,229
and process allocation
within your organization.

210
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,530
And you may also be someone

211
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,829
who's in the decision-making
position as well.

212
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,780
So finally and I think this

213
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,860
might be my favorite part of this model,

214
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,630
is a proximity perspective
and relationships.

215
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,023
So people's perspectives;

216
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,580
they shift based on how close they are

217
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,410
or their proximity to various behaviors.

218
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,650
And what I mean by this,

219
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,860
is that we have a very
different perspective

220
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,290
or opinion about our own behaviors,

221
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,719
which we're very close to

222
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,000
than we do about other people's behaviors

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,633
because they're further away.

224
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,470
For example, regular employees,

225
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,630
everyone out there

226
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,200
sort of expects a certain
degree of protection

227
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,150
that they should be
provided by email security,

228
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,829
web security, whatever we
have installed on the laptop

229
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,490
that we've taken home
with us for the past year.

230
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,740
And when they click on a
link in a phishing email,

231
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,960
they understand what was
going on around them.

232
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,820
Maybe they were distracted,
maybe it was 2:00 in the morning

233
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,020
and they open their email
to check on something.

234
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,130
But the issue is

235
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,000
that beyond that little sphere

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,423
of the person who's most
closely linked to that behavior,

237
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,130
other people just lose that context.

238
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,439
And so when you remove
from that one-on-one space

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,193
where it's me and my phone,
clicking on the wrong link,

240
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,180
and you step back and see

241
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,739
what maybe your security team looks at,

242
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,950
they're more likely to judge you harshly

243
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,430
because they're not judging you based on

244
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,280
the known environmental factors,

245
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,069
they're judging you based on
the one observable behavior

246
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,690
that they can see from further away.

247
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,510
So this disparity goes
both ways and challenges

248
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,439
an understanding and interpreting behavior

249
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,080
based on how close you are to it,

250
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,384
can, if not dealt with,
have a negative impact on

251
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,760
your organizational culture

252
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,053
as well as employee relationships.

253
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,730
In addition, when we're considering

254
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,060
organizational components such as culture,

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,349
there might be mismatches
in how people really behave

256
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,480
and how the organization
wants them to behave

257
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,370
including leadership.

258
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,670
Often we live in a fantasy
world where we believe

259
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,870
or expect people to work
or behave in specific ways.

260
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,660
Often this is not the case.

261
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,709
And rather than taking time to observe

262
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,180
or measure the real
behavior, we ignore it.

263
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,280
We go on living in our fantasy world.

264
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,053
And I think this is a huge mistake.

265
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,160
This is very relevant to our field.

266
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,860
As we often set up rules and
guidelines that are difficult,

267
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,750
or frankly annoying to conform to,

268
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,540
and we're left with no choice
but to ignore work arounds

269
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,520
or blatant habitual rule-breaking,

270
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,569
since it's the only way to get work done.

271
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,950
It's kind of amazing what
we'll let slide in these areas.

272
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,890
So finally relationships
are critical here.

273
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,540
Dissonance between
people, groups of people

274
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,800
and organizational vision creates tension

275
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,522
that can emerge as bad behavior.

276
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,950
Accurate understanding

277
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,550
and representation of
responsibilities, expectations,

278
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,060
and along with fewer problematic

279
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,160
or negative interpersonal issues

280
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
can be reflected in a positive way.

281
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,840
Bad behavior, tension and animosity

282
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,420
is as much more closely tied
to insider threat behaviors

283
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,680
especially those associated
with sabotage or theft.

284
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,109
So this slide is something
that you're gonna see

285
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,110
several times because I'm using this

286
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,983
as a way to walk through the
different parts of the model

287
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:51,983
that go along with the examples
that I'm going to give you.

288
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,100
So we're going to walk
through the human component,

289
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,920
implicit component and
organizational component

290
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,650
and how they relate to three
insider threat examples

291
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,583
that I'm going to talk about now.

292
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,853
So here we have the accidental insider.

293
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,410
So here we have Heather.

294
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,660
Heather leads the technical team.

295
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,280
She's recently been awarded a
really, really large contract.

296
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,040
And it's a big deal,
everyone knows about it.

297
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,910
She's managing a lot
of new communications.

298
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,380
She has a lot of new contacts

299
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,450
both internally and externally.

300
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,380
It's really fun.

301
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,740
It's really busy.

302
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,830
And almost every day, she's
talking to someone new

303
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,310
or building something new
or accessing something new.

304
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,699
If anyone's out there who's
started a new project,

305
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,220
that probably sounds pretty familiar.

306
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,760
So one day she receives
an email, it looks like

307
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,480
it's coming from one of her new contacts

308
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,190
and it's inviting her to
collaborate on a document

309
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,930
and she needs to sign up for
a new account to access it.

310
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,229
So she clicks the link,
she enters credentials

311
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,580
and then she continues
working on her projects.

312
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,533
We're sitting here when thinking, Heather,

313
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,260
why did you click that?

314
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,160
Why didn't you check a little bit further?

315
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
Why didn't you look specifically

316
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,530
at the sender's email address?

317
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,870
Why didn't you dig a
little bit more deeply into

318
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,890
the link that you just clicked.

319
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,939
She's gone through years

320
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,996
of cybersecurity awareness training.

321
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,370
What gives Heather?

322
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,513
So let's take a look
and see what happened.

323
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,793
So first we know a few things
about Heather as a person.

324
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,930
She is a leader, she's very
active in her organization

325
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,599
and she's very collaborative.

326
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
She's a conscientious high performer

327
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,860
which frankly is one of
your most valuable people.

328
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,459
What we see in terms of
her explicit human behavior

329
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,370
is that she clicked a link
and entered her credentials

330
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,830
into a malicious site.

331
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,640
And I gotta tell you,
most companies stop here.

332
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,130
And it's okay because these
are critical things to know.

333
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,640
And it's critical that we
deal with them when it occurs,

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,113
but I would encourage people
to go a little bit deeper.

335
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,900
When it comes to the implicit component,

336
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,600
let's think a little bit about
what Heather's going through.

337
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,070
Heather has had a major
change in environment.

338
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,220
She is experiencing increased volume

339
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,990
and frequency of emails.

340
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,410
I'm sure her social sphere
is expanding really quickly.

341
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,020
It's very difficult to keep up
with all of her new contacts.

342
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,890
She may also be a little bit stressed out

343
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,240
or more stressed out because her new role

344
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,470
is a little bit higher up.

345
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,580
She's got a lot of
leadership boots to fill

346
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,810
and she has a lot of
pressures of kicking off

347
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,423
a high profile project.

348
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,100
She also may feel very rushed

349
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,293
if you've ever worked on something major.

350
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,110
Sometimes these contracts at
the very early days come with

351
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,650
just mountains of things to
do really, really quickly

352
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,310
like in the first few weeks.

353
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,439
So she may be experiencing
those types of pressures.

354
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,080
In addition, the
collaborative software systems

355
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,319
that her company uses aren't great.

356
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,960
They make it more difficult
and slow to share items.

357
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,290
So rather than depending
on her company's sharing,

358
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,609
she often will sign up
and use another company

359
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,189
or an external companies sharing platform

360
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,123
instead of they're in their own company.

361
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,109
At the organizational level,
we found something out.

362
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,733
A new executive decided that
they were going to downgrade

363
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,780
web and email security products

364
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,680
because they found something cheaper.

365
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,830
One of the things that
they noticed is that

366
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,159
it had been a while since
something bad had happened

367
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,520
and probably not news to you,
but it's probably because

368
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
their previous products
were a little bit better

369
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,050
at blocking things from
reaching their employees.

370
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,010
Employees are also kind of under the gun.

371
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,879
They very much are expected
to follow the rules

372
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,330
and the organization is very authoritarian

373
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,240
where they're known to fire people

374
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,763
for accidents and mistakes.

375
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,260
So looking at the picture, the
proximity, the perspectives,

376
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,260
the relationships, Heather didn't notice

377
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,550
that she made a mistake.

378
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,230
She's very close to it,
but she didn't notice.

379
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,380
She finally realized she made a mistake

380
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,220
when her account locked her out.

381
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,890
She spent hours trying to work with IT

382
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,190
reinstating her account, trying
to deal with loss of work.

383
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,750
And when she finds out about
her mistake, she feels bad.

384
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,220
But the email looked fine.

385
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,830
The page that she entered her
credentials and looked fine.

386
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,070
However, management who's
a little bit further

387
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,629
from the action finds
that she was negligent,

388
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,200
caused of data breach and
she's damaged the company.

389
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,330
So Heather, who is a top
performer is now placed

390
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,462
on a performance plan to
help build better behaviors

391
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:52,813
as a reprimand.

392
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,360
So this perspective and the proximity

393
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,090
has damaged their relationship.

394
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,310
The expectations are mismatched

395
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,639
and the trust between
Heather and her employer

396
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,230
has been negatively
impacted by that experience.

397
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,310
So how do we deal with things like this?

398
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,600
How do we cope with
mistakes and accidents?

399
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,490
So, first I believe that we need to invest

400
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,020
in behavioral analytics
that can accurately

401
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,940
measure behaviors
associated with human error.

402
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,630
How many links were clicked?

403
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,540
How many accidentally
accidental emails were sent?

404
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,480
How many credentials were compromised

405
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,100
over the course of a year?

406
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,189
Can we start learning a little bit more

407
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,900
about the contextual factors

408
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,000
that may have contributed to that mistake?

409
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,330
What were the outcomes?

410
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,399
If you made changes, how did it impact

411
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,363
people's performance in this area?

412
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,429
We also need to use security solutions

413
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,290
that limit exposure to risky situations.

414
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,593
And we need to keep all of
those solutions updated.

415
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,270
There are a lot of fancy
things out there these days.

416
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,270
And things like email and web are enormous

417
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,480
for helping people have less exposure

418
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,920
to some of the more risky
things that can land

419
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,450
in front of their face on their computer

420
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,713
like phishing emails, for instance.

421
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,560
We also need to keep in mind that

422
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,980
people are always going
to make the mistake.

423
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,560
Someone's always going to click the link.

424
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,629
Someone's always gonna open
something that they shouldn't.

425
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,990
And it's important to keep in mind

426
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,920
that we need to focus on error tolerance

427
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,640
and building out mitigation strategies

428
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,223
rather than focusing on no mistakes ever.

429
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,580
There's no possible way that
we can train away human error.

430
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,980
And focusing only on training for instance

431
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,000
is not going to get you
as far as you need to get

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,070
with regard to protecting your company

433
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,520
from things like human error.

434
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,959
So let's take a look
at another person here

435
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,620
who has unfortunately caused
some problems for his company.

436
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,120
So Kevin, he's a tech savvy
financial professional.

437
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,199
Living in a big city, he loves it.

438
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,290
He loves the perks of his
luxury apartment building.

439
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,899
He's online all the time.

440
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,370
manages everything using
apps, his personal accounts,

441
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,713
finances, anything using his phone.

442
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,930
Every quarter in his role,

443
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,120
he engages him in a major
financial review for work.

444
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,280
And he is the one who's
in charge of building

445
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,149
the executive slide deck.

446
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,880
This presentation is very high profile.

447
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,690
He prides himself on ensuring
that every detail is correct

448
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,733
and that all the figures are perfect.

449
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,560
And also happens to contain
sensitive information

450
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,639
about how the company is performing.

451
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,070
He prefers to print out the
final deck to make notes

452
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,860
and to identify minor changes
or edits that need to be made.

453
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,830
Some things are easier to see on paper

454
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,100
and I really have to agree,

455
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,879
sometimes I think maybe I'm getting old,

456
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,480
but I still have to take
things and print it out

457
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,150
so I can write on it.

458
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,030
Since this is the only thing
that Kevin typically prints,

459
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,060
he can depend on his apartment
buildings business center

460
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,080
and he emails the file
directly to the printer

461
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,240
to pick up a few minutes later.

462
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,300
So one night he's working on the report.

463
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,970
He ordered some food, sends
the file to the printer,

464
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,440
so he can pick it up
after he grabs his meal,

465
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,270
when he gets to the
printer, nothing's there.

466
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,570
So he resends it, goes
back to the business center

467
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,260
to grab the documents.

468
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,830
Unfortunately for him, the first document

469
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,730
did print in the business center,

470
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,230
but someone else picked it up.

471
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,050
The other thing you might know about

472
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,270
large metropolitan areas
and luxury buildings,

473
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,700
they're filled with professionals

474
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,720
and some of them are
working for your competitor.

475
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,830
So let's take a look at
this, using the model

476
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,669
and see if we can find
some of the root issues

477
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,083
for this workaround.

478
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,020
So first let's explore
the human component.

479
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,710
What do we know about Kevin?

480
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,953
He's meticulous, but he likes convenience.

481
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,330
He's going to take the easy
route to get the job done

482
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,740
but not necessarily because he's lazy,

483
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,050
it's more that he wants to
get to the meat of the work

484
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,730
without delay, which means that

485
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,580
he tends to break a few rules
that speed up his progress.

486
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,650
What a company might see
in terms of their data

487
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,840
at the behavioral level,

488
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,370
they'll probably see that
Kevin printed a document

489
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,800
and a lot of companies stop there.

490
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,780
Some other companies who have
a little bit more capability

491
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,850
in this area may be able to tell

492
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,100
that Kevin printed a sensitive document.

493
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,179
They may be able to tell
that Kevin used an unapproved

494
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,260
or strange printer.

495
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,680
You may notice that he printed

496
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,423
the same sensitive document
twice using a strange printer.

497
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,770
When you get there, a
lot of places stop again

498
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,363
at this human behavior level.

499
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,143
So let's see let's go further

500
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,880
and look at some of
the implicit components

501
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,103
that have impacted his choice
to engage in this behavior.

502
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,470
So Kevin's home office
set up is bare bones.

503
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,150
He likes to grab his laptop
and work from other spaces.

504
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,610
He rarely feels the need
to use a fancy setup.

505
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,780
Plus he's got a great office
to go to whenever he needs to

506
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,853
barring global pandemics.

507
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,139
He also doesn't wanna
take up a lot of space

508
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,210
in his apartment.

509
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,850
He's been waiting out work from home.

510
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,070
He's getting along pretty
okay on his 13 inch laptop.

511
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,220
It's just not the best for reviewing

512
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,320
big important presentations.

513
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,310
Since he rarely print
anything it didn't make sense

514
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,510
to get his own printer either.

515
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,910
So Kevin's manager earlier
in the day reminded him that

516
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,500
he needs to make sure the
presentation is perfect.

517
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,590
They have an okay relationship,
but his manager is demanding

518
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,669
and can be critical when work
products have minor errors.

519
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,430
So this is a lot of
pressure, both in quality

520
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,240
and potentially in time

521
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
that could be impacting
Kevin's decision making.

522
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,000
At the organizational level
Kevin's organization is

523
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,380
a go-getter culture where
things are done fast

524
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,410
and perfect is the most important factor.

525
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,270
People tend to work in isolation.

526
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,740
They like to keep their
big projects to themselves.

527
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,880
The employees are hyper-competitive

528
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,670
and if they see somebody making mistake,

529
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,580
they're not really shy about
it and they will point it out

530
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,273
and critique others.

531
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:36,810
So the other factor here is
that in this organization

532
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,840
the culture is one of compliance.

533
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,840
So all of the information
security rules and policies

534
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,620
are based on compliance
almost exclusively.

535
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,409
And while they're sensitive in some areas,

536
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,930
employees can quickly learn work arounds

537
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,880
from their peers and supervisors
for accessing information

538
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,013
or for getting work done in other ways.

539
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,423
When it comes to proximity
perspective and relationship,

540
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,520
Kevin does a very good good job
of rationalizing his actions

541
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,889
by aligning his behavior
with organizational norms.

542
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,853
He knows everybody's printing
things where they want to.

543
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,490
He knows people share using
personal cloud accounts.

544
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,830
He knows people avoid their
communication monitoring

545
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,699
by using personal phones and
text messaging or whatever.

546
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,780
He's also aware that
printing in a business center

547
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,639
isn't ideal, but he's gonna do it anyway

548
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,310
because part of the
culture in his organization

549
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,163
is implicit approval of
breaking certain rules.

550
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,090
Management, while they're
further from the action,

551
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,439
they may not ever be
aware of Kevin's behavior

552
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,230
or the fact that somebody
picked up the printed document.

553
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,470
If they were aware,
they might not even care

554
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,737
that he printed it.

555
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:57,650
They would only care if
there's an adverse outcome

556
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,450
due to the competitor learning
about their financial status

557
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,420
or something else in the report.

558
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,320
And if there was an adverse outcome,

559
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,020
they would have Kevin to point to.

560
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,580
So this is a situation where
the employee's actions mirror

561
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,280
and are aligned with the
organization's values,

562
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,649
his behavior which is risky
and not really representative

563
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,634
of a healthy security culture,

564
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:21,560
mirrors the health of an organization,

565
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,909
the security health of an organization,

566
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,400
which isn't that great.

567
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,840
And in terms of resilience,

568
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,929
when you have this
permissiveness of get it done

569
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,493
no matter what rules, whatever,

570
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,010
it can be challenging to maintain

571
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,823
the ability to recover from major issues.

572
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,773
So what can we do about workarounds?

573
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,030
They're very common and
they're very creative

574
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,870
and people find new ways
of skirting your policies

575
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,060
every single day.

576
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,899
So one thing that we can do is, again,

577
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,420
turn to behavioral analytics
and look for analytics

578
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,100
that can identify anomalous behaviors.

579
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,490
And when I say this, I
don't necessarily mean

580
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,740
just an individual person.

581
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,070
We can look at the rules that individuals

582
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,862
or groups of people are breaking.

583
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,250
And then we can in turn,
decide if it's time to adjust

584
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,010
some policies that aren't working.

585
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,530
So if every single person
in the marketing department

586
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,680
is breaking the same rule,
maybe that rule isn't compatible

587
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,330
with the work that they're doing.

588
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,420
For very very critical things
that you can't say, sorry,

589
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,833
we're gonna take the rule
away, forget about it,

590
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,990
there are ways to create
systemic constraints

591
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,803
that block or prevent high-risk behaviors.

592
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,050
You must know first and foremost

593
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,139
where all of your high value assets are

594
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,880
and how your employees interact with them,

595
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,870
which again is a behavioral factor.

596
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,739
And then communication is key.

597
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,000
So slowing people down or
blocking people from doing things

598
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,760
can just increase people
working around the rules.

599
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,720
However, if you can communicate
the meaning of the rules

600
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,880
and make the impact or the
purpose visible to the users,

601
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,180
you have a much better chance
of people following through

602
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,923
and following your critical rules.

603
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,000
Finally, we have the
disgruntled, the destructive.

604
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,330
So we have Rita, full disclosure,

605
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,130
that is what my husband calls
me when I'm angry, Rita.

606
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,660
(Margaret laughs)

607
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,630
We have Rita here.

608
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,060
She's been dealing with a boss

609
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,163
who won't recognize her contributions.

610
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,190
The boss takes credit for her work.

611
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,003
She's undervalued, she's
underpaid, she knows.

612
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,699
She also realizes that
her manager has been using

613
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,950
her entire team's materials for years

614
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,523
and no one will say a word about it.

615
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:55,550
No one likes this manager.

616
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,430
It's been three years, Rita's
waiting for the title change.

617
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,023
She's waiting for the raise.

618
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,129
She's promised more money

619
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,980
because she's continuously
taking on more responsibilities.

620
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,570
It seems like there's not another team.

621
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,780
And a lot of her peers feel the same way.

622
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,960
Whenever she complained,

623
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,730
she's told this is the way it works.

624
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,080
This is a start-up, leave
if you don't like it.

625
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,820
So what do we know here about Rita?

626
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,366
So we know she's talented
and we know she's mad.

627
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,643
That might actually be enough.

628
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,690
What can we see?

629
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,950
So Rita is stealing data.

630
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,410
We see the data leave.

631
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,080
She's also sabotaging and damaging data,

632
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
which we may be able to detect

633
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,832
if we track things like file
deletion on our network.

634
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,082
At the implicit level,

635
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,530
she's having a pretty acute
triggering emotional response

636
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,080
that has had a huge
impact on her behavior.

637
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,840
The work environment is
stressful, it's negative,

638
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,720
it's toxic.

639
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,700
We can see that in the fact that no one

640
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,290
in her peer group is satisfied or happy

641
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,793
or interested in staying and
working there for much longer.

642
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,370
At the organizational level,

643
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,786
this is a markedly toxic culture.

644
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,740
It's weighted towards the
powerful and it really leaves

645
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,950
some of the workers in the dust.

646
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,450
There's also a lack of investment

647
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,020
in professional development

648
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,020
and a very fast and loose
cutting corners environment.

649
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,683
In terms of proximity
perspectives and relationships,

650
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,419
Rita did something really bad
but she did it on purpose.

651
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,995
She meant to cause damage or disruption

652
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:46,870
but from where she was
sitting, it was justified.

653
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,899
She felt ownership of her work.

654
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,810
And she was taking the
opportunity to leave with her work

655
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,919
while also retaliating against people

656
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,413
who she felt had wronged her.

657
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,000
In another set of shoes in the management

658
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,930
and the organization

659
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,410
at the higher levels of the organization,

660
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,930
they see Rita's actions
as entirely malicious

661
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,700
and take no other view than
to mark her as the culprit.

662
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,623
Her boss notes also that
she's difficult to work with.

663
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,360
This is another situation
where the employee's actions

664
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,570
mirror and are aligned with
the organizational values.

665
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,960
Her actions and her feelings

666
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,727
were fostered by the environment

667
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:25,160
and the environment
will continue to foster

668
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,170
disgruntled feelings

669
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,043
and potentially ongoing
insider threat activities.

670
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,379
So, what can we do about bad actors?

671
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
This can be hard because sometimes

672
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,900
if you have a very culture

673
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,760
that people who need to
do something about it

674
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,351
are making the decisions.

675
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:45,865
(Margaret laughs)

676
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:48,920
So, first again I'm gonna to
turn the behavioral analytics.

677
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,370
There are products out
there that can highlight

678
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,372
interpersonal and social behaviors.

679
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:58,230
In this instance, it would
have been very valuable

680
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,950
to identify her manager who
likely had a high turnover

681
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,290
of his employees and also poor reviews.

682
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,940
It's also really very interesting to see,

683
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,340
who has stopped interacting
with their team?

684
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,409
Who has dropped off and
has kind of pulled away

685
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,780
from their group and their peers?

686
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,930
There are also ways to identify
people who are very upset

687
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,113
through looking at negative communication.

688
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,770
So we can also use these types of

689
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,670
interpersonal and social behaviors

690
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,599
as context for interpreting
other risky behaviors

691
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,679
or behaviors of interest,
that standing alone

692
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,980
might not really raise an
eyebrow or be detectable.

693
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,010
So we can look at how people
are interacting with files,

694
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,840
if their access has changed,
and then think about

695
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,250
whether or not that person is also upset

696
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,350
or experiencing some sort of issue

697
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,543
within their own professional environment.

698
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,640
For these issues, for
some of these bad actors

699
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,310
who are very emotionally
invested in what they're doing,

700
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,549
the organizational response is critical.

701
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,310
And when I say that, I
mean that there are ways

702
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:20,310
to address people who are unhappy or angry

703
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,739
so that you don't make the problem worse.

704
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,520
And so it's very important
to have a plan in place early

705
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,840
so that you're not
cobbling something together

706
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,590
as someone is kind of devastated

707
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,963
or planning on retaliating
to your company.

708
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:43,370
So I'm gonna leave with
just a few summary items

709
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,260
and some key takeaways.

710
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,400
And what I've done here
is really consolidated

711
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,880
some of the items that I listed

712
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,130
after each of the three examples.

713
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,969
So first and foremost, as you can tell,

714
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,620
I'm a big, big believer
in behavioral analytics

715
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,270
and understanding human behavior.

716
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,339
Behavioral analytics
give us so much insight

717
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,340
into what human error looks
like, why it's happening,

718
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,350
different types of behavioral anomalies

719
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,100
whether it's I'm being
strange compared to myself,

720
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,150
that seems odd for Margaret to do,

721
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,703
or if it's odd for a
research scientist to do

722
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,470
or a programmer to do.

723
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,169
So we can look at these things
and these changes in behavior

724
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,663
across individual peer
and organizational groups.

725
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,819
I think the other thing that
we've neglected quite a bit

726
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,120
in this industry is
understanding interpersonal

727
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,870
and social behaviors.

728
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,589
These different types of behaviors

729
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,220
are what we spend most of our
time doing and engaging in.

730
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,540
And pretty much all of
these types of behaviors

731
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,270
have an impact on how we're
interacting with our coworkers,

732
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,963
with the data that your company owns,

733
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,473
with people outside of the company.

734
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,602
It can be very informative.

735
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,703
So what do we do?

736
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,090
What do we do when we have
all these analytics built out?

737
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,390
We can use them.

738
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,390
They are great values
to help enable things

739
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,210
like understanding risk and context

740
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,130
around other types of
traditional security behaviors.

741
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,760
So how can I tell the difference between

742
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
someone who's opening a bunch of new files

743
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,649
because they started a new project

744
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,900
and someone who's opening
a bunch of new files

745
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,974
and looking around and doing some recon

746
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:38,120
because they have something else going on,

747
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,170
that I might be able to understand better

748
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,153
if I had that context from
the behavioral analytics.

749
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,470
These data points are
also very, very useful

750
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,071
for shaping strategies that improve

751
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:53,410
the types of decisions we make
and the types of investments

752
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,103
that we make around
our security solutions.

753
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,280
And as the title of this
presentation alludes to,

754
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,160
I believe that many of the
behaviors that we can observe

755
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,250
and many of the things
that we can understand

756
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:15,250
using behavioral analytics
is a great way to gauge

757
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,743
the health and resilience
of your organization.

758
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,840
And finally, I will take this with me

759
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,100
pretty much everywhere I go.

760
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,190
There are not always technological

761
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,110
or hardware and software solutions
to some of these problems

762
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,000
or some of these issues that we're facing.

763
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,620
It really is time to start adapting to

764
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,200
and incorporating more human solutions

765
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,439
and a more human focused approach

766
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,243
for improving our security postures.

767
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,870
So thank you so much for joining me today.

768
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,069
I'm really looking forward
to answering questions

769
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,250
and being a part of our live discussion.

770
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,927
I hope that you had fun
thinking about human behavior

771
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:01,344
in cybersecurity.
