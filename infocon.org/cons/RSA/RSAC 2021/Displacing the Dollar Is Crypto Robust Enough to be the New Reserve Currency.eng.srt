1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,160
- I'm sure you've heard this story,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,160
that in 2010 someone paid
10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,200
and today they are
worth over $500 million,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,410
those same Bitcoins.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,800
So those are very expensive pizzas.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,730
And what you're probably asking yourself,

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,983
is where is this thing going?

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,080
Is cryptocurrency going to change my life

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,639
or change the world,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,523
maybe even end the nation state as it is?

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,400
In war time, it's very clear

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,470
how fragile human civilization is.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,470
And in fact what is of value to people.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,599
Because banks, they can
either have their money stolen

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,840
by their home country
because they need it for war,

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,863
or by an invading country.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,470
In World War II,

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,470
the most fascinating stories took place

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,530
when England and France shipped their gold

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,050
to the United States for safekeeping.

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,050
So over time, there's a lot to think about

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,710
in terms of how we got
here and where we're going.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,839
Especially in this case,
related to cryptocurrency.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,510
A long time ago,

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,213
there were shells and
salt and various things

26
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,690
that people bartered with

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,870
in exchange for goods and services.

28
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,703
But these things,

29
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:34,010
they usually required some proof of work,

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,010
that someone had found and
extracted and standardized,

31
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:42,920
something like a gold coin,

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,190
something like a bar of gold,

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,220
and these things, they tend to survive.

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,082
We have examples of gold
coins and paper currency

35
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:56,070
already from 1,000, 3,000 years
ago, in the case of China.

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,559
One thing about gold to be
aware of, is that it's rare.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,810
It's beautiful.

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,670
It's not poisonous or
radioactive or corrosive.

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,240
So there are certain characteristics

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,790
that make some things
more valuable than others.

41
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,079
Now, after World War II,

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,510
the allied powers tried to create

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,299
some level of stability in the world.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,210
And they created a system

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,530
based on this little
town in New Hampshire,

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,170
in a place called Bretton Woods.

47
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,829
And basically what happened

48
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,400
is the dollar was pegged
to the price of gold

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,100
and foreign currencies were
pegged to the US dollar.

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,079
The US dollar was crowned
the world's reserve currency.

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
And what this means

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,149
is that it is held in a
kind of risk management

53
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,960
by other countries.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,210
They hold on to it
because again, it's stable

55
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,350
and it provides a source of stored value

56
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,519
and a medium of exchange

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,690
that may be their currency wouldn't have,

58
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,050
if you were a small country

59
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,410
who might get run over by a
bigger country, for example,

60
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,070
or you didn't have access to
the enormous supply of gold

61
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,602
that the United States does.

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,140
So, money.

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,102
It's really important when we
think about cryptocurrency,

64
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:23,920
to think about what makes for money.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,899
And it really is a human construct.

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,460
It's based on economic consensus.

67
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,810
It's a social convention.

68
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,960
There's some kind of
standardized shape, size, weight.

69
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,410
So there's something called legal tender,

70
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,810
which under a certain rule of law,

71
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,960
merchants are required to accept it.

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
So at a coffee shop,

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,770
when the barista, before
they make your coffee,

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,640
they don't have to take your money.

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,529
But after they make your coffee, they do.

76
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,420
They're required by law
to take your money for it.

77
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,350
So it's something that can be
exchanged for goods, services,

78
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,519
and then governments are
required to accept it as taxes.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Good money is scarce, authentic,
durable, portable, stable.

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,160
And digital currency,

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,350
if it is to survive and to thrive

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,920
and to reach its potential,

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,250
should have the exact same traits.

84
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,650
Now money leads to power.

85
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,650
So the US, it has the
trust of other countries

86
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,289
who give the United States their money.

87
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,570
They buy US Treasury securities

88
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,140
because they're considered safe.

89
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,691
And this is what we mean
by a reserve currency.

90
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:46,691
Other countries, they put
their trust and their money

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,173
into the United States.

92
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,340
But it does lead to
benefits of different sorts

93
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,823
for each party.

94
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:59,229
So, for those who are investing,
again, there's stability.

95
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,420
They're seeking to avoid devaluation.

96
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,380
They're seeking to counter inflation.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,950
And what they get in
the United States dollar

98
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,880
is a managed supply.

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,130
They get access to
liquidity, access to markets,

100
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,513
and they're buying into a system of trust.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
Monetary policy.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,489
When you hear that word
on the evening news,

103
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,890
what it's referring to

104
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,853
is a government that is trying
to further these concepts.

105
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,900
The United States wants
people to trust in the dollar,

106
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,830
so they'll use it.

107
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,460
Now on the US side, there
are certain advantages

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,570
to having everybody give you their money.

109
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,890
You can only imagine
if this were the case,

110
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,140
in your house in the neighborhood,

111
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,510
if you had that same privilege.

112
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,250
And some of the countries call
this an exorbitant privilege,

113
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,450
it allows the United
States to monetize its debt

114
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,840
or to run balance of payments deficits.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,673
What this means

116
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,500
is we can be a little more
carefree in our spending

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,730
and we have the bandwidth
to pursue policy objectives

118
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,380
that other countries can't.

119
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,380
So money again, in this
case, can equal power.

120
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,159
Because the United States, you might know,

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,820
has the most military assets by far.

122
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,900
So some nations are not
going to be happy with this

123
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,349
and to seek changes.

124
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,035
But nothing lasts forever.

125
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,020
So in the United States,

126
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,500
we had the New Deal social
programs, the Vietnam War,

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,110
all of these kind of put
a strain on our ability

128
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,000
to manage this Bretton Woods system.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,350
And by 1971, the United
States was forced to end

130
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,670
the convertibility of the dollar to gold,

131
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,650
float its currency against
worldwide currencies,

132
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,719
and declare that the US
dollar is a fiat currency.

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,870
And what that means

134
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,980
is it's backed by nothing
else other than trust.

135
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,010
There's no gold behind the US dollar.

136
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,320
It's only your belief
in the current system.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
So let's look at the things

138
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,979
that digital currency will have to achieve

139
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,260
in order to succeed.

140
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,400
And there's three essential
elements of money.

141
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,469
The first is called medium of exchange.

142
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,830
Basically that means

143
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,140
that it needs to be an intermediary
token of a certain value

144
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,507
that can be traded for goods or services.

145
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:26,979
And the benefit of a medium
of exchange like a dollar

146
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,820
is that it avoids what economists call

147
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,790
the inconvenience of coincidence of wants.

148
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,440
In other words, you may not want my apple

149
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,190
and I may not want your banana.

150
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,730
But if that's all we've
got, then we're stuck.

151
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,720
But if we find an intermediary
token to exchange,

152
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,710
then many more options become available.

153
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,349
There's a very famous story in Kenya,

154
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,700
near where I'm currently
living, in Mozambique.

155
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
And what happened there,

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,310
was that people began to have access

157
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,870
to cell phones and airtime.

158
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,470
So they started to trade
airtime as currency.

159
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,303
And what this did

160
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:12,033
was lead to a major international
corporation called M-Pesa,

161
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,440
that we use, for example,

162
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,440
we just gave our gardener some money

163
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,909
and they were able to
transfer it via M-Pesa

164
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,543
to the North of Mozambique.

165
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,840
And it all started with
the transfer of air minutes

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,439
as a medium of exchange.

167
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,250
The next thing is called unit of account.

168
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,380
And this is sort of a stable measure

169
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,169
that can be used in
multiples of the same unit

170
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,170
to calculate costs, prices,
profits, and performance.

171
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,591
And the same thing, people
want to be able to measure

172
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:54,440
the trade and purchase and
sale of goods and services.

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,430
One very important element

174
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,120
is called double entry bookkeeping.

175
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,500
So it's keeping on the credit
side and the debit side

176
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,160
the same number.

177
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
And this lies at the
very heart of capitalism.

178
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,500
And when people began to figure
out double entry bookkeeping

179
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,530
it really helped Europe, for example,

180
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,500
to emerge from the dark ages.

181
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,700
Specifically in Italy in the 1300s.

182
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,450
So another important
concept here to mention

183
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,530
is that of a ledger.

184
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,220
So it's a record of economic activity

185
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,050
and financial relationships.

186
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,880
And ledgers are so important in fact,

187
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,340
they may be even older than
writing for communication.

188
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,680
We have found bones in Africa

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,131
that have a kind of correspondence ledger

190
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,770
that is over 20,000 years old.

191
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,750
A good ledger is kind of like good money,

192
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,100
but it has slightly
different characteristics.

193
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,680
It should be immutable, unchangeable.

194
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,790
This is a very important aspect of Bitcoin

195
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,839
that we'll see soon.

196
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,370
Timestamped, same thing.

197
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,550
Show ownership.

198
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,709
And be accurate.

199
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,050
And so it's all about
having a payment system,

200
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,349
a way to amend ledgers.

201
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,090
That basically is, if you think about it,

202
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,470
when you go to buy your morning coffee.

203
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,350
Your ledger gets deducted

204
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,373
and the coffee shop's
ledger gets added to.

205
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,340
So store of value.

206
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,410
This is the most difficult aspect

207
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,449
for a cryptocurrency to achieve,

208
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,340
because of its volatility

209
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,840
and the lack of basically,
a central management.

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,700
But those are benefits of
course, in other ways for crypto.

211
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,630
But in a store of value,

212
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,890
you're talking about a durable
asset that has stable demand

213
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,750
and saved purchasing power.

214
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,850
So for example, Russia today
is buying a lot of gold

215
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,850
because of its inherent
properties that make it valuable.

216
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:02,602
So these things, you can use
them for risk management.

217
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,463
They can counter inflation
or the fear of inflation.

218
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:11,370
The US dollar has been very
successful as a store of value.

219
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,860
And that's one reason why
it's been around for a while

220
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,590
as a reserve currency.

221
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,430
In fact, it's been so valuable
that numerous countries,

222
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,770
some for example, Cambodia, Ecuador,

223
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,810
Lebanon, Somalia, Zimbabwe,

224
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,790
they have officially adopted the US dollar

225
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,122
because their own currencies
were too volatile.

226
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,670
You can't pay a $100 billion for dinner.

227
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,729
In fact, that happened in many countries,

228
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,200
so what they did was they just
switched to the US dollar.

229
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,560
Let's talk for a second just a little bit,

230
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,449
about the options that would be available

231
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,830
because we want to know
whether cryptocurrency

232
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,550
could replace the US dollar.

233
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,977
So currently in Russia,
Vladimir Putin is thinking,

234
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:02,977
"Hmm, how can I have a strategy
to de-dollarize my economy,

235
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,340
lower our vulnerability to US sanctions,

236
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,590
and make Russia more independent?"

237
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,840
So they are currently the
biggest state buyer of gold.

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,309
In January 2021,

239
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,309
the amount of gold just recently
passed dollars, 23% to 22%,

240
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,210
in terms of the reserve
in quantity in Russia.

241
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,380
About cryptocurrency,

242
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,800
some authoritarian
governments are hesitant,

243
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,969
because part of the beauty

244
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,530
for the owner of
cryptocurrency is independence.

245
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,300
Transnational personal power.

246
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,319
And of course, dictators
don't really like that.

247
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,090
And so, in Russia, there've
been a lot of legislation

248
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,100
to stifle miners and ban cryptocurrency.

249
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,680
But anyway, I just wanted you to think

250
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,930
about an alternative to the dollar,

251
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,329
that may not be cryptocurrency,
that's out there.

252
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,890
Here's a picture of Shanghai.

253
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,340
So you can see in China,

254
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,680
they have gone a little bit
in a different direction,

255
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,680
and are investing more
in cryptocurrency already

256
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,392
than Russia.

257
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Modern IT, if you think
about it, is so powerful.

258
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Ethernet, 1974, TCP IP, 1974,
HTTP, 1990, SSL TLS, '96,

259
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,300
and now Bitcoin, 2009.

260
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,300
These are programmable network protocols

261
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,293
that can do amazing things,

262
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,170
in the mind, not only of the programmer,

263
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,410
but potentially a revolutionary,

264
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,699
in terms of political and digital thought.

265
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,310
So part of the challenge
with cryptocurrency

266
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,910
is how to move value across
a decentralized network,

267
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,890
peer-to-peer, with no
trusted intermediary,

268
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,563
again, no double counting.

269
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:14,760
And that chips away at what's
called the cost of trust

270
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,050
and something that would change

271
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,349
the economics of verification.

272
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,063
Who are you, and have
I received my payment?

273
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,620
And in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, in a paper

274
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,630
called "Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer
Electronic Cash System"

275
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,240
revealed not only Bitcoin, but blockchain.

276
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
That combines asymmetric
cryptography, PKI,

277
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,450
hash functions for integrity
and tamper resistance,

278
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,450
digital signatures for consent,

279
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,480
append-only timestamped
logs, and much else.

280
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,430
These are the kinds of things

281
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,319
that literally can be used to
secure the entire internet.

282
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,960
What you want are verifiable
immutable transactions.

283
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,210
And one of the things that
Bitcoin and blockchain

284
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,480
have claimed to have solved

285
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,010
is something called the
Byzantine Generals Problem.

286
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,730
which is how do you get all
of your military elements

287
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,050
working together?

288
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,420
It does require a lot of trust, right?

289
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,910
Because just before the attack,

290
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,990
a lot of units want to go quiet

291
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,380
so they don't give away
their positions, et cetera.

292
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,000
But then how do you know that everybody

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,600
is doing what they're supposed to do?

294
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,870
So if you look that up, the
Byzantine Generals Problem,

295
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,239
this is one historic challenge

296
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,270
that Satoshi Nakamoto has
claimed to have solved.

297
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,650
Today, there's over 1000 cryptocurrencies,

298
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,970
which shows its promise,

299
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,350
and also numerous initial coin offerings.

300
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,350
And in China, again, most
payments, to about 80% today,

301
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,350
are already digital payments.

302
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,060
And even in fact, in the United States,

303
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,209
you're using your card
a lot more than dollars.

304
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,850
But one test will be in 2022,
the Beijing Winter Olympics,

305
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,380
where they will test cryptocurrency.

306
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,439
Okay, just a word on blockchain,

307
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,580
because it's sort of the foundation

308
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,440
that makes all of this happen.

309
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,080
And if you go back to
the ledger discussion,

310
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,260
which is so key to a modern economy,

311
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,280
basically, a cryptocurrency
is a digital asset,

312
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,150
kind of like the app,

313
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,020
that is decentralized
and used among humans,

314
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,380
but blockchain is the ledger technology.

315
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,950
It's an auditable database that is public,

316
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,530
and the records can be looked up.

317
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,270
It's a list of records that are,

318
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,449
these blocks are tied
together with cryptography.

319
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,690
They're timestamped, they're append-only,

320
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,360
which means that it's kind
of like a house of cards.

321
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,670
If you were to go back and
change one of the blocks,

322
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,520
then the whole thing would fall apart.

323
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,627
So that the math is designed
as kind of a one-way math,

324
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:10,450
that when something
happens on the blockchain,

325
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,273
it stays there forever.

326
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,689
So from a human perspective,

327
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,690
it is a communication protocol
that is based on consensus.

328
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,433
So it's public, it's secure.

329
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,280
It creates additional coins through mining

330
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,780
and it verifies coin ownership.

331
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,310
There are a lot of technical aspects

332
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,970
to the input and output of the blocks,

333
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,010
but basically for the
purposes of this talk,

334
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,890
it's just important to know

335
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,880
that they are tied
together in important ways.

336
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,497
Now I'm going to turn it
over to Kathy, CISO at VGS,

337
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,460
to talk a little bit more

338
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,840
about mining, cryptocurrency mining.

339
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,199
- Great. Thank you, Kenneth.

340
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,010
And that was a really
awesome intro to currency.

341
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,680
And you know, the topic of this talk

342
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,300
is whether cryptocurrency
can displace the dollar.

343
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,480
So what are some of
the operational aspects

344
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,880
of cryptocurrency that is going on?

345
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,433
So let's talk about mining a bit more.

346
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,640
So if you're someone

347
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,190
who wants to get access
to Bitcoins, for example,

348
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,720
there's two ways to do that.

349
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
You can either mine it, or
you can purchase Bitcoin,

350
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,540
or acquire it.

351
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,080
Well, acquiring it is not cheap,

352
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,543
the current market rate of Bitcoin

353
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:45,590
is well over 50,000
right now, per Bitcoin.

354
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:50,350
So, let's specifically use Bitcoin mining

355
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,550
as an example here,

356
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,620
because Bitcoin is the most popular

357
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,072
of all of the different
options for cryptocurrency.

358
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,270
So right now, at over 50 K per Bitcoin,

359
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,170
perhaps mining is a more desired
approach for some people.

360
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,830
So let's talk about how mining works

361
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,793
and what actions are
Bitcoin miners taking.

362
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,980
So what essentially miners are doing

363
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,700
is they're trying to be the first

364
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,420
to come up with a solution to a puzzle,

365
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,630
like a hashing puzzle.

366
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,390
So the probability of being the first

367
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,740
to discover the solution

368
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,880
is proportional to the amount
of mining, or computing power,

369
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,163
the miner has on their network.

370
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,570
That's what it is.

371
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,280
This process used to be easier

372
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,210
back when Bitcoin mining started,

373
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,790
but has increased fairly
exponentially in difficulty

374
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,270
as more entities have
caught on to Bitcoin mining,

375
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,100
and there's more and more units out there,

376
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,713
or miners out there.

377
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,200
So if you think about it from
a hardware setup standpoint,

378
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,940
I have a background in
hardware engineering,

379
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,463
so love to think about
this kind of problem,

380
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,520
miners need to have access
to graphics processing units,

381
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,520
or GPUs, for example, to
set up mining operations.

382
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:28,550
There are now entire
mining farms that exist

383
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,970
to conduct Bitcoin mining.

384
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,410
So in fact, the picture
that you see on this slide

385
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,060
is a mining farm in Iceland of all places.

386
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,060
By very remote places where
property and all of this setup

387
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,243
can be done fairly easily.

388
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,070
So going back to what I said earlier,

389
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,679
about being the first
to solve the solution

390
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,193
to a hashing puzzle,

391
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,530
why are they doing that?

392
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,250
So miners are doing this

393
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,900
because they're effectively
conducting auditing

394
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,650
to verify the legitimacy of
the Bitcoin transactions.

395
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,690
This is actually pretty clever,

396
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,200
that this is the reason why
they're solving these puzzles.

397
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,500
And then there's a whole reason for that.

398
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,300
This auditing minimizes the risk

399
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,419
that Bitcoin holders could make
a copy of the digital token

400
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,590
and spend the same Bitcoin
twice, for example.

401
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,990
You wouldn't want that.

402
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,052
If you have an actual
physical dollar, you spend it,

403
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:36,730
it goes into the hands of someone else,

404
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,430
you can't then re-spend it.

405
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,730
But with digital tokens,

406
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,730
it's not quite that
straightforward as physical money.

407
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,730
So this is a mechanism by
which that risk is minimized.

408
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,440
So in this way, miners work
to verify, for example,

409
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,440
one meg worth or a block
of Bitcoin transactions.

410
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,810
So at that point,

411
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,639
when they verify this block,
the miner is eligible,

412
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,150
but not necessarily going to be rewarded,

413
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,180
with a certain quantity of Bitcoin.

414
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,750
But to actually get rewarded, or get paid,

415
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,180
the miner needs to be the first one

416
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,870
to come up with the exact or close

417
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,399
64 digit hexadecimal number, or the hash,

418
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,580
that is less than or
equal to the target hash.

419
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,439
So this means that only miners

420
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,010
that are able to generate high hash rates,

421
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,600
and when I say high,

422
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,867
we're talking like terahashes per second,

423
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:47,930
have a good chance to succeed

424
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,630
to actually get paid for this.

425
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,933
So it is not easy to get paid for mining.

426
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,300
So what does that mean
for resourceful miners,

427
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,050
the ones that are actually getting paid?

428
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,050
They're probably joining
mining pools to pool resources.

429
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,730
And some of them are also
looking to take advantage

430
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,023
of potentially free resources out there.

431
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,955
For example, both GitLab and GitHub

432
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:23,560
offer free CI minutes to a certain extent.

433
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,580
So what miners might do

434
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,770
is they might create a
whole bunch of free accounts

435
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,770
on these infrastructures
owned by GitLab or GitHub.

436
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,850
And the miner would get access

437
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,282
to a good deal of computing power.

438
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:42,746
All at the expense of
either GitLab or GitHub.

439
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,810
So of course, this is considered

440
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,360
to be against the terms of service

441
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,510
or terms of use for GitLab or GitHub,

442
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,629
and is considered to be abuse activity.

443
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,800
And then it becomes
imperative for the company,

444
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,810
like GitLab or GitHub, to figure out

445
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,179
how to detect those type
of cryptomining activity

446
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,120
and block the activity

447
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,852
so that they don't have
to pay for that usage.

448
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,320
Detecting and blocking
cryptomining activity,

449
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,803
just like any detection work,
is very much an arms race.

450
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,610
Detecting indicators of
cryptomining activity

451
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,610
can include conducting
analysis of DNS traffic,

452
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,419
or monitoring for specific
strings or patterns

453
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,110
in network packets,

454
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,110
or potentially monitoring IRC
communications in a network.

455
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,290
But keep in mind that as
you're developing algorithms

456
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,060
to monitor and detect and
then subsequently block

457
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,840
this type of activity
on the infrastructure,

458
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,840
the miners are also reacting
to that blocking activity

459
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,040
and maybe upping the ante

460
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,290
on how to avoid being detected next time.

461
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,860
So what you see is a lot of what we call

462
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,889
low and slow type of activity,

463
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,890
where it probably will not
easily spike utilization

464
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,159
of your resources,

465
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,420
because that would just be
way too easy to discover.

466
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,070
So this is what I mean by this
is very much an arms race,

467
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,240
because it's not easy to deal with.

468
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,850
So what we've done before

469
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,530
was maybe use machine
learning based heuristics

470
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,280
to process a lot of data and
look for outlier behavior,

471
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,020
which helped with the low
and slow types as well.

472
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,270
But this is not easy
to implement of course.

473
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,860
So we've all heard the
term crypto-jacking before,

474
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,449
but exactly what does this mean?

475
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,940
So, miners are very resourceful.

476
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,500
They're very financially motivated.

477
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,930
And some of them are targeting, attacking,

478
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,460
and compromising internet-facing computers

479
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,670
to gain control of large
numbers of resources

480
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,200
to conduct mining activities.

481
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,550
So for example,

482
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,129
one of the most publicized
cryptomining malware

483
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,563
includes WannaMine.

484
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,420
So miners are very resourceful.

485
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,030
They're doing a number of things

486
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,010
to try to either get free resources,

487
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,010
or pool together to actually
get paid for the transactions.

488
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,010
And now we move

489
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,180
to what are the benefits
here of cryptocurrency,

490
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,940
and Kenneth will take that.

491
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,510
- Thank you so much, Kathy.

492
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,030
So I just want to mention briefly

493
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,629
that at the individual level

494
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,660
as well as at the national level,

495
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,660
there are truly revolutionary
aspects about cryptocurrency.

496
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,580
If it's really decentralized
and transnational,

497
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,790
just think about the personal potential

498
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,350
and even for at the nation
state level, developing nations,

499
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,350
to have an alternate way
to invest and to save

500
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,210
other than, let's say, being
dependent on the US dollar.

501
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,630
But at the individual level,

502
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,700
there are ownership issues
that are so important,

503
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,910
not only in terms of potentially ROI,

504
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,770
but access to credit, the
ability to exchange assets,

505
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,730
we've seen with NFTs recently,

506
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,780
in the news over the past few days.

507
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,520
So it applies to the poor person
as well as the rich person,

508
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
a poor person wants some access,

509
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,260
but even rich investors,
since the market cap,

510
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,090
the spreads that they seek
in terms of investment,

511
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,514
and even shifting risk to certain parties

512
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,370
where they haven't been
able to in the past.

513
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,300
All of this leads to political potential

514
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,793
that could in fact, slow
down acceptance and use

515
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,080
and adoption of cryptocurrency.

516
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,970
Because for example, I have a
lot of experience in Estonia

517
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,180
where I used to live,

518
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,570
and they have put more of
their government services

519
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,370
and digital society online
than any other country.

520
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,010
And they claim that it's
specifically in many cases

521
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,550
meant to diminish corruption,

522
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,750
by publishing more of
taxes, more of budgets,

523
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,300
more of salaries.

524
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,940
And one of the questions

525
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,500
is, do governments actually
want to be less corrupt?

526
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,190
And that's a political question

527
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,056
for voters and for governments.

528
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:54,720
But more transparency could
lead us in that direction.

529
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,930
But I am excited about
all of these things,

530
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,570
really, that what I want to emphasize

531
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,320
is that these political impacts

532
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,240
may in fact slow down adoption,

533
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,830
because governments in their desire

534
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,730
to get their mind around this issue,

535
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,603
will create policy obstacles to adoption.

536
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,659
On the risk side, there's just
a lot to think about as well.

537
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,480
And I'll mention, for example,

538
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,420
lost hardware and lost passwords.

539
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,720
You've probably all seen this in the news,

540
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,060
and it's not an isolated case,

541
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,210
but there's one person

542
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,610
who has been in the New
York Times recently,

543
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,745
who has over $5 million in Bitcoin,

544
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:46,650
but has forgotten his password.

545
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,850
And so you could sum all of the risks

546
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,500
up into that, for example.

547
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,163
How many times have you lost a phone,

548
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:58,860
or upgraded a phone,

549
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,199
and then you can't remember the password

550
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,827
when you pull it out of
a drawer the next year?

551
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:08,110
So, there's a lot.

552
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,120
And on the criminal side,

553
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,537
one of the things is
weak know your client.

554
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:18,538
So, Bitcoin exchanges, for
example, that are high risk,

555
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,320
they might be dealing in criminal activity

556
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,320
or even terrorist activity
that governments are wary of.

557
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,350
So central banks, one of
the things they want to do

558
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,419
is protect investors and protect citizens.

559
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,830
From scams, and because
governments like stability.

560
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,669
Depending on which government, of course,

561
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:46,660
but most sitting governments
want to stay in power.

562
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,550
And so they do tend to
err toward stability.

563
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,500
So anyway, there's a
lot to think about here,

564
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,565
including, if you're a small player

565
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,730
or potentially a government.

566
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,730
Even losing some of your authority.

567
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,879
So I think you will find
governments hesitant

568
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,100
to let go of the dollar in this case,

569
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,290
or let go of their
authority in a bigger sense.

570
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,580
So let me pass it back to Kathy

571
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,840
to talk about security in this space.

572
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,030
- Yeah. Thank you.

573
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,360
So how many of you have had people ask you

574
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,041
about what's the security of
Bitcoin or cryptocurrency,

575
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:34,879
as if it's a brand new problem?

576
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,120
But if you think about
the security pillars

577
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,379
of confidentiality,
integrity, and availability,

578
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,370
all of that does apply to
cryptocurrency as well.

579
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,493
So what are the security
implications for cryptocurrency?

580
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,700
I think the place that we should look at

581
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,270
as being sort of the
Holy Grail or the vault,

582
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,270
of where access is probably,
successful access is best,

583
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,910
is with the crypto wallet.

584
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,080
That's where all of the
private keys are stored.

585
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,689
And if you get access to a crypto wallet

586
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,503
then you effectively own the currency.

587
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,440
So can attackers steal that wallet?

588
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,900
Well, you have to think about
it from that perspective.

589
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,343
Absolutely they can.

590
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,610
Did you ever hear of
ElectroRAT malware for example?

591
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,070
So the RAT part stands
for remote access tool,

592
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,620
and ElectroRAT was thought
to have been released

593
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,439
maybe over a year ago,

594
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,650
and had been targeting users

595
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,350
via cryptocurrency and
blockchain related online forms.

596
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,439
This was actually almost
like a marketing campaign,

597
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,330
where there were ads and there were posts

598
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,429
that enticed users to actually click on

599
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,430
downloading a particular app
to help them get more Bitcoin.

600
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,510
But then once they installed the app,

601
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,760
then it's actually a malicious
app that is quite intrusive.

602
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,580
And it conducts activities,
such as key logging,

603
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,580
ex filling files, executing
commands on the target system.

604
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,140
And this malware worked for multiple OS's,

605
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,640
including windows, Linux, Mac OS.

606
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,320
But what was remarkable about
this particular malware,

607
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,280
was that it was written from scratch.

608
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,440
The attacker actually wrote
this whole thing from scratch,

609
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,850
created this whole campaign
around the distribution of it.

610
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,330
And it was able to evade

611
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,949
signature based malware
detection capabilities

612
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,240
for quite some time

613
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,910
because it was written from scratch.

614
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,320
There wasn't like some sort of pre-canned

615
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,889
type of malware module that it used

616
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,830
that made it easier to detect
by signature based systems.

617
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,560
So this is actually pretty remarkable,

618
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,870
and I anticipate that more
of these will be rolling out

619
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,263
as the value of Bitcoin increases.

620
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,790
But, you know cryptocurrency wallets,

621
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,714
they hold private keys, as I said,

622
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:25,360
and the pillars of security still apply,

623
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,659
just like any other sensitive data

624
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,429
that needs to be protected
from unauthorized access,

625
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,913
unauthorized modifications,
and inaccessibility.

626
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:40,949
So thinking about it a little bit ahead

627
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,639
of where things are right now,

628
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,400
a lot of you may be familiar
with the Zero Trust principle.

629
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,170
And what is Zero Trust?

630
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,130
Zero Trust is the principle or the model

631
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,097
of tying in the user, a device,

632
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,540
and the type of data
that is being accessed.

633
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,920
So can this type of model
or principle be applied

634
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,920
to further secure the SAS-based
crypto wallet, for example?

635
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,930
Of course it can.

636
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,040
Because a lot of the same principles

637
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,009
still apply with sensitive data.

638
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,550
For example, access to the
wallet could be restricted

639
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,320
to only a specific user
utilizing a specific device

640
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,830
in order to access the wallet.

641
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,080
And maybe just also enable

642
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,509
a multifactor authentication scheme

643
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,180
so that the access process

644
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,480
is further secured or tightened as well.

645
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,960
So these are ideas

646
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,070
that are kind of floating
around the community

647
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,410
in terms of how to secure crypto wallets.

648
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,799
But that has to be the number
one target by attackers,

649
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,030
just because of what it is.

650
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,830
- So we're going to wrap up now,

651
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,746
just in the next two slides and say,

652
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:04,746
there is no doubt that
cryptocurrency is a game changer.

653
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,692
Blockchain, I'm sure you've heard,

654
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:10,980
could be as big as the internet itself.

655
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,690
The price of Bitcoin speaks for itself.

656
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:18,690
The vast potential awaits in this space.

657
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,370
That said, to answer our question

658
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,790
for this talk in particular,

659
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,844
in the near term,

660
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:30,844
cryptocurrency cannot be a
replacement for the US dollar

661
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,160
due in particular to its
security, it's volatility.

662
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,530
But if you put it in
conceptual terms, its trust.

663
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:45,980
Its speed.

664
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,110
Visa right now can do about
70,000 transactions a second.

665
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,150
By comparison, Bitcoin is doing a handful.

666
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,090
So it will take time.

667
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,990
Over the longterm

668
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,033
there will be plenty of
interest in cryptocurrency,

669
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,960
but public adoption,

670
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,429
remember the airtime anecdote from Kenya,

671
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:13,429
it will become a societal
norm, but it will take time.

672
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,640
The security risks

673
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,620
have to be better
understood and addressed,

674
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,430
the speed in the payment
system needs to be faster.

675
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,759
But in fact, the same thing
happens with every technology.

676
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,980
So credit cards in the 1950s,

677
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,660
it took about 15 to 20 years
for Congress to enact laws

678
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,600
that understood and
managed all of the issues

679
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,540
surrounding credit cards.

680
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,573
So just keep your eyes
peeled in this space,

681
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,570
but financial firms will
be one bellwether to watch.

682
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,380
What are they doing?

683
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,380
How are they absorbing this
into their traditional systems?

684
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,670
I want to on this last slide,

685
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,600
if you choose to buy,

686
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,110
if you choose to opt for
cryptocurrency over dollars,

687
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,150
in this case, we want
to have a disclaimer,

688
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,270
and say, we're not investment advisors,

689
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,880
we're information security researchers.

690
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,483
However, we have found some
pretty interesting advice,

691
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:24,279
such as the three key elements
of investment I came across,

692
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,280
which is consistency, tax
planning, and emotional control.

693
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,839
So you don't want to be a
minimalist or a maximalist

694
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,720
in this case,

695
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,370
but just think about it
rationally, have a plan.

696
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,220
Is your goal wealth
preservation or wealth creation?

697
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,953
How much bandwidth do you have?

698
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,743
Because, let's face it,

699
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:51,487
Bitcoin might be the most
valuable asset in human history,

700
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:56,487
or via some kind of
policy or trust failure

701
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,195
might drop to zero.

702
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:05,140
So Elon Musk can afford
to lose his Bitcoins,

703
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,542
but you and I are not
in the same position.

704
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:13,840
That said, there's plenty of
space for growth in FinTech.

705
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,240
There's a lot of economic
rent in the system

706
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,399
that FinTech is finding it can improve

707
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,170
in terms of efficiency and speed,

708
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,910
space, access, scale.

709
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,779
Remember that most of the
world is still unbanked.

710
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,430
So part of the goal of
many FinTech companies

711
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,430
is to figure out how to
offer credit and services

712
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:41,319
to much of the world

713
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,063
which has not had access
to traditional banking.

714
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,870
So we'll leave it there

715
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,109
and just say that it's best
to have a logical plan for you

716
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,660
and to revisit it regularly.

717
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,750
Many, many thanks for your time.

718
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,583
- Thank you.
