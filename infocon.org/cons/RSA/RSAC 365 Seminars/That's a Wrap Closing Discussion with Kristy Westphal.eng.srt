1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:04,440
- So, Kristy, I know that when
we started, we had the goal

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,320
of creating this arc

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,530
of content that was
intended to be consumed

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,039
in this digestible format

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,957
of the half day seminar, just
three and a half quick hours

6
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:14,696
but totally enlightening starting here

7
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:18,869
at this point with the first
session and then ending

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,100
with this panel discussion
on business continuity.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,654
I know that you attended
many of the sessions today.

10
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,549
So I guess my first question

11
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,259
to you is how do you think it went?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,010
Did we deliver on telling that sort

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,147
of story of the arc of the
narrative of Cloud security

14
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,253
or reducing Cloud risks, but
you haven't thought of yet?

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,910
- Yeah you know, that was my whole intent

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,410
behind picking topics was these are

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,479
things that I wanna
have conversations about

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,250
and I cannot thank our speakers enough.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,000
I just, the other sessions
that I was able to attend

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm just, I'm so, you know

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,950
I did find out things that
I hadn't thought of yet.

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,921
So I think it was a success

23
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,983
and I hope others felt the same way.

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,781
- So feel free to be as
specific as you want about

25
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,100
the actual sessions that you did attend

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,490
but I'm wondering what were

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,113
for you, some of your top
takeaways from today's seminar?

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,760
- You know, so I attended,

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I attended the monitoring
session, the staffing session,

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,660
and then Charles is, you know,
you're here now, what kind

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,801
of session, which, and
they were all fantastic.

32
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:38,339
And the first thing, first
takeaway is I'm gonna go back

33
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:40,760
and watch the sessions
that I didn't get to sit

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,600
in on and hear from everybody else

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,949
because I wanna make
sure I cover everything.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,910
But really, I think for me

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,625
the big takeaway is we have to start

38
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:57,625
having these conversations, right?

39
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:01,950
These hard conversations
of these are real risks.

40
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,400
You know, we are here now,
maybe not everything's perfect.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,979
So let's dig into that
and really figure out

42
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,812
how we're gonna do that.

43
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:11,089
A couple of the specific themes

44
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,510
that I think are super important

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,890
it's that governance.

46
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,713
You know, we've gotta have some cohesive,

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,890
flexible framework to operate in

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,102
under the Cloud so that the business

49
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,950
can get their value out of it.

50
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,820
But you have to have that
security and privacy layer on it

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,299
or you're just going to introduce risks

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,230
that perhaps you didn't expect.

53
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,655
So it's just really kind of going back

54
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,110
and starting those conversations

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,006
and starting to go around my organization

56
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,880
and start peaking in the corners
again and seeing, you know

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,680
what else we missed, what
else do we need to talk about?

58
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,846
- And so, you know, one of the objectives

59
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:58,690
with the educational
content that we share at all

60
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,690
of our conference is
making sure that, you know

61
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,810
number one is educational and informative

62
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:12,840
and also that it's
actionable for attendees.

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,483
So I wanted to ask you
based on some of the things

64
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,690
that you've taken away from today's,

65
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,382
what are some next steps
that you'll take back

66
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,501
to your role with you?

67
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,371
And how will you apply
what you've learned today

68
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:32,993
in the coming weeks, days, and months?

69
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,239
- Yeah and first step, like I said

70
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,390
I'm going to watch the other sessions

71
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,290
because I wanna make sure that I,

72
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,730
you know, I hear everything.

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,725
But for my actionable steps
back in my organization

74
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,725
is really getting that
governance structure back

75
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,413
into place, I think is
going to be critical.

76
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:58,003
You know, at some point,
whether you start there

77
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:01,000
and whether you've lost
the governance structure,

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,088
or whether you created it later

79
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:07,143
I think that open
conversation has to happen.

80
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,196
And so the other couple

81
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,448
of things we do testing all the time

82
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:17,447
but I don't think we've had
a really in detail Cloud test

83
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,799
with all the parties
that need to be involved.

84
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,190
And everybody that mentioned it is spot

85
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,974
on it's you do not
understand what's gonna break

86
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:30,620
until you start walking through,
or actually get your hands

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,890
on the keyboard to do this.

88
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,510
So that's another thing.

89
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,610
And then the other,

90
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,663
the last part is getting
back into the training.

91
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,320
You know we gotta make sure that our staff

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,397
are adequately trained to understand

93
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:47,398
how to detect, and analyze,
and respond to incidents

94
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,479
in the Cloud because they're gonna happen

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,187
and we wanna make sure that we're

96
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,546
and Roger just said it in the panel,

97
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,670
we wanna make sure that we are

98
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,430
not trying to undo that
during an incident.

99
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,741
So I think more,

100
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:06,500
more repeat exercises where we can

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,537
kind of go through them until
it's kind of muscle memory

102
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:12,332
I think is really important.

103
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:16,440
- Yeah and I think, you know,
those just, it's important

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,269
for attendees to really take the time

105
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:23,007
to you know, in listening to lay that out

106
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:26,530
I think, you know, for them really reflect

107
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,409
on, okay, so this is,

108
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,620
these are the conversations
that I was able to sit in on.

109
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,180
These are the sessions that I heard

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,320
and what's so important
is those next steps.

111
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,349
What do I do with that information?

112
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,223
How do I make that actionable

113
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:46,897
and, you know, actually
start to implement.

114
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:51,250
And so is there a way or
advice that you can give

115
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,030
to the listeners about how
to sort of implement those,

116
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,539
the application of those steps?

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,057
- Well, and that's the hard part.

118
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,870
The things we've talked
about today are big problems

119
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,040
and they're big efforts, right?

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,630
So don't, you know, don't
try to do everything at once.

121
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,787
You've gotta figure out

122
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,549
where's your highest priority risk?

123
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,340
What are you most concerned
about in your organization?

124
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,000
And start breaking that down into,

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,846
into manageable chunks that
can be addressed, right?

126
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,802
You're not, everybody's
limited on resources.

127
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,500
You may not have all the training you want

128
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,512
or need, you may not have,

129
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,890
you know, even know
where all your assets are

130
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,849
start small, but start somewhere.

131
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,110
That's the important part.

132
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,142
Just again, prioritize where
you think your biggest gaps are

133
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:41,590
as an organization, don't
make that in a silo,

134
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,299
that decision, and then
just start chipping

135
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,260
away at it.

136
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,193
And you'll get there
hopefully sooner than later.

137
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:53,361
- Excellent, Kristy, thank you so much.

138
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:56,630
I know that you've dedicated
so much of your time

139
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,630
and energy to helping us in to create this

140
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,270
our first quarterly seminar.

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,870
And we really appreciate all

142
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,564
of the help that you've given to us.

143
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:14,450
And again a shout out to all
of the speakers who contributed

144
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,765
to the success of today's event.

145
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:22,130
We so look forward to the continuation

146
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,230
of these quarterly virtual
seminars, our next one coming

147
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,448
up in March and then June,
September, and December of 2021.

148
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,882
Don't forget listeners

149
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:35,882
that we also have our January
summit coming up January 27th.

150
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,570
It's a full day event with
four tracks, multiple sessions,

151
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,590
interactive opportunities,
and even a sponsor showcase.

152
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,123
So we're really looking forward

153
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:50,090
to seeing you again, on more
of our content that we deliver.

154
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,734
Thank you so much,

155
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:53,777
Kristy.
- Thank you.
