00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,349
- Hello and welcome to our
closing panel discussion

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,867
for this half day seminar
in "Reducing Cloud Risk:

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:08,129
"What You Haven't Thought of Yet."

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,030
Today's panel is called Sweeping The Area,

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,640
Cleaning Our Cloud Risk To
Maintain Business Continuity.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,410
As a reminder, this
session is being recorded.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,510
The recording will be made

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,030
available in the virtual environment.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,660
Our panel of guests will be
taking questions at the end

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,390
so please submit your questions

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,610
through the Q&A feature below.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,710
I'd now like to turn it over

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,633
to Kristy Westphal to get started.

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,530
- Thank you Kacy.

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,120
Yes, I'm Kristy Westphal and
it's really been a pleasure

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,649
to help in the coordination
of the day's programming.

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,460
I hope everyone has gotten a little,

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,518
little bit or a lot of
bits to take home with them

19
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:50,310
because I've certainly learned a lot.

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,690
This topic of business
continuity seemed to be

21
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,460
an appropriate ending for our event today

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,670
because it really ties all these themes

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,350
that we've talked about together

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,830
plus it gives us even more to consider.

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,170
So I'm really excited to hear
more from our speakers today

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,430
about some questions I'm
going to pose to them.

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,890
So I know many of you have
attended their sessions

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,100
but I'd like to ask each of the panelists

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,570
to quickly introduce themselves

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,440
and then I'll jump in with the questions.

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,003
So let's start with Charles.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,380
- Hi everyone.

Intelligence Expert at IBM.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm excited to be here today,

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,640
talking to you about cloud security.

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,473
Thanks.

37
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,210
- Thanks Charles.

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,350
Let's go to Roger please.

39
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,369
- All right.
Thank you very much.

40
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,590

Manager in the financial sector

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,030
and I know all the things cloud

43
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,480
and happy to help here today.

44
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,640
- Awesome.
Thanks Roger.

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,503
Niles.

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,240
- Hello everyone.

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,170
I'm so happy to join everyone
today during this conference.

48
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,370
And my name is Niles as you've heard

49
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,583
and I currently drive Cloud
security Adoption for Cisco.

50
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,200
- Excellent.
And last

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,190
but certainly not least, Michee.

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,130
- Hello everyone.
My name is Michee Smith

53
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,490
and I'm a Product Lead for
Cloud Security and Privacy

54
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,190
on Google cloud platform.

55
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,224
And I'm excited to be here
today to talk to you about

56
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,322
privacy and risk management.

57
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,440
- Well, that is a great segue
into our first question.

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,452
So let's...

59
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,540
I'm gonna start with you Michee.

60
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,540
What does a comprehensive
cloud risk program look like?

61
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,820
I, it's hard for me to
wrap my head around that.

62
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,382
What specific risks and point
solutions should we consider?

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,989
- So I think there's a couple of things

64
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,300
when you think about a cloud risk program

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,647
that's a little bit
different and I'm coming from

66
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:50,647
infrastructure as a service
perspective but it also varies

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,723
depending on what type
of model you're using.

68
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,500
There's a shared responsibility

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,950
between the customer
and the cloud provider.

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,019
And as you'll see, as you
go through different models,

71
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,280
like if you're using a
software as a service model,

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,100
the cloud vendor will take on

73
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,750
way more of that responsibility than the,

74
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,330
a model where you're as an
infrastructure, as a service

75
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,810
where a lot more responsibilities
is with the customer

76
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,000
or equally shared between
the cloud provider.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,710
And so when you're making a risk,

78
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,690
a comprehensive risk program,

79
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,030
you really have to start to look at

80
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,530
across the different areas of risk,

81
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,476
whether you're thinking
about this as continuity,

82
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:32,476
security, privacy, what is the
shared responsibility model?

83
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,179
How much is my responsibility?

84
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,940
How much is the cloud
provider's responsibility?

85
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,400
And when it comes to the cloud
provider's responsibility,

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,362
you need to understand

87
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:43,070
how are they measuring
that responsibility?

88
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,430
Are there frameworks that they're using

89
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,270
that are specifically
developed for the cloud?

90
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,046
Because there are some
frameworks out there

91
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,870
that stipulate things
that don't really apply

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,800
in a cloud computing environment.

93
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,340
So you have to look at those frameworks,

94
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,280
how do they certify
against those frameworks?

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,097
Are there added stations available

96
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:02,140
as you're starting to build
up your, the information

97
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,470
that you're gonna use
to inform how much risk

98
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,027
you're taking on by choosing
that cloud provider?

99
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:09,323
The other thing that you
should really think about is

100
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,610
what data or what assets am I gonna put

101
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,990
into the cloud provider?

102
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,480
That's definitely gonna
determine what type of risk

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,630
framework you have for
that cloud provider.

104
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,269
So if you're gonna put some
of your more sensitive assets

105
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,659
that are heavily regulated,

106
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,990
let's say something like
personally identifiable information

107
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,230
or health information, you'll
find that your risk tolerance

108
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,730
is gonna be much lower than if
you were doing something like

109
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,105
aggregated data that doesn't have any

110
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,200
sensitive nature to it.

111
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,099
So that's the other thing
that you have to think about.

112
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,600
What's gonna be the
impact to your business

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,470
if any of the risks materialize

114
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,470
and you can use a very
rudimentary impact model like CIA,

115
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,153
if you've heard of it,
confidentiality, integrity,

116
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:56,689
availability, what are
those kinds of impacts?

117
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,221
Or you could do something
a lot more granular

118
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:02,500
based on your control data.

119
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,520
And then I would say the final
thing that I would consider

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,150
when thinking about building
a comprehensive program

121
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,599
on the cloud providers
that data scales so much.

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,675
There's so many things
that people will just throw

123
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,980
into a cloud once you start
using the cloud provider

124
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,420
whether it's a SAS or a PaaS or IS,

125
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,210
whatever the model is,

126
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,200
people in your organization
are just gonna start putting

127
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,710
a lot of data there

128
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,152
and you're gonna wanna
have a governance program

129
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:31,240
that starts to lean
towards the automated side

130
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,214
so that you can scale

131
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,640
'cause you're gonna wanna
make sure that you understand

132
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,390
what assets are there, right?

133
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,695
Asset inventory is a key
part of any risk program,

134
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:40,960
any security program.

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,010
You have to know what assets

136
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,693
you're trying to protect, right?

137
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,030
You're gonna have to know how to access,

138
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,239
how they're deployed,

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,960
what security configurations and controls.

140
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,039
And that in order to keep up with that,

141
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,130
you're gonna have to start looking

142
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,100
at some automated governance models

143
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,607
so that you can fully have

144
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:57,113
a comprehensive cloud risk program.

145
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,860
- Wow, that's a lot.

146
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,620
Thank you for that Michee.

147
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,820
Charles, would you like
to weigh in on that?

148
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:08,727
- Sure.

149
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:09,640
And I'm not sure how much
I can necessarily add here.

150
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,409
That was a very comprehensive
answer by Michee.

151
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,770
So a lot of great information there

152
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,729
that I absolutely agree with.

153
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,110
I tend to look at things
from a more tactical level.

154
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,400
Being a threat intelligence guy

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,524
that tends to be more
of my area of expertise.

156
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,430
And when I'm thinking about, you know,

157
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,850
how to make a comprehensive
program for a cloud environment,

158
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,191
I think from a cybersecurity perspective

159
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,239
which I think directly impacts
sort of the risk perspective,

160
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,350
my biggest thing is cloud
specificity and practice.

161
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,670
And this was something
that Michee also touched on

162
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,600
which is, you know, you
need to make sure you have

163
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,420
a cloud specific governance
structure for your risk.

164
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,420
But from a cyber security
security perspective,

165
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,039
you need to make sure that
you have a cloud specific plan

166
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,380
for your incident response
and for potential, you know,

167
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,710
data incidents that occur in the cloud

168
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,454
or involving your cloud environment.

169
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,320
A lot of times I've
talked to organizations

170
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,669
and they have incident
response plans in place

171
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,510
but they might not have
one specifically designed

172
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,409
or a cloud-based incident

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,840
and that can lead to a lot of
potentially negative outcomes.

174
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,010
So I think there's a lot of
benefit to making sure that

175
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,830
cloud specificity is built in

176
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,150
across your overall security structure.

177
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,270
And when you're looking at, you know,

178
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,400
developing your incident response plans,

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,907
making sure that cloud is
incorporated into that as well

180
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:23,933
with real intention, not
just sort of on the side.

181
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,690
In addition, I think that
another key component

182
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,120
to having a comprehensive
plan is practicing.

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,870
And this is a big, this
is a big point that I make

184
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,160
to the clients all the
time that, you know,

185
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,470
having an incident response plan

186
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,550
or having a cyber security plan in place

187
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,160
for your cloud environment is good

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,950
but if you haven't tested that plan,

189
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,370
if you haven't, you know,
really engaged in an effective,

190
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,223
deep dive, tabletop exercise
or cyber range exercise

191
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:48,807
for the organization,

192
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:50,940
you're not gonna know
where the potential holes

193
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,120
or pitfalls are.

194
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,126
And this goes back to a point that again,

195
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,909
citing Michee comments here, you know,

196
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,550
depending on if you're using
cloud for infrastructure

197
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,980
as a service or software as
a service versus, you know,

198
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,720
what have you as a service,

199
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,400
there will be different
components there that may play in.

200
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,989
And based on that relationship,

201
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,699
you might have to adjust your plan

202
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,748
and tweak it in small ways

203
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:14,930
to accommodate those
different relationships.

204
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,770
But you won't necessarily know
exactly how to accommodate

205
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,490
that or what exact changes
to make until you test it.

206
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,719
So my biggest recommendation
to an organization

207
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,230
that's looking around and saying,

208
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,363
okay, we really wanna
be comprehensive here,

209
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:28,890
is I would say, you know,

210
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,424
take all that great advice
that Michee just gave you

211
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:35,250
and set up your initial comprehensive plan

212
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,240
but then test it, you know.

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Make sure that you're
running through exercises

214
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,570
and running through scenarios to make sure

215
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,880
that it's gonna be
effective when, you know,

216
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,769
if something occurs and
not just sort of in theory.

217
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,010
So that's my, those are my main additions

218
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,263
in addition to everything
else that's already been said.

219
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,865
- I liked that.
Yeah, it's definitely when

220
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,120
something happens and
we need to be prepared.

221
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,940
So thank you for that Charles.

222
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,060
All right.
So I'm gonna

223
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,462
switch up questions here

224
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:02,890
and I'm gonna start
with Roger on this one.

225
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,170
In what ways that you see
currently can cloud providers

226
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,699
help customers manage their
portion of the risk portfolio,

227
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,000
kinda going back to that
shared responsibility model?

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,070
- Right.
Excellent question.

229
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,780
And I'm gonna approach that
from two separate areas.

230
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,453
The first one we need
transparency from the providers.

231
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,650
The veil of the cloud is unknown

232
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,860
for a lot of companies out there.

233
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,100
We're at a stage

234
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,925
even though the cloud
keeps being adopted widely,

235
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:36,160
a lot of people out there
don't really understand

236
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,579
what's happening behind the scenes.

237
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,650
So we are assuming a
certain amount of risk

238
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,449
by letting the provider
control some of the,

239
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,770
some of the stuff behind the scenes,

240
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,370
they're controlling the
physical infrastructure

241
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,528
and things like that.

242
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,720
Our job as cloud consumers is
going to be to question that,

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,090
to ask questions, you know.

244
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,079
The wiseman said trust but verify.

245
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,310
That is what we need from the providers.

246
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,097
We need to keep those
communication channels open.

247
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,714
And I know it might be
a little bit difficult

248
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:10,700
for big providers like
AWS, Azure et cetera,

249
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,180
they sure cannot be responding

250
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,689
to every single question out there

251
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,790
but what they are doing is
polishing more information

252
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,622
of what they're doing,

253
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,580
how they're managing
all that infrastructure,

254
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,250
processes, all of that

255
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,170
and that gives assurance
to the customer staff

256
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,610
things are being managed

257
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,980
to the level that they're
willing to accept.

258
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,540
If we don't have that,

259
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,980
if we don't see what's happening,

260
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,390
we don't get any sort of response

261
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,448
from our call service providers,

262
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:38,310
well, we really can quantify the risk

263
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,847
that we're assuming here.

264
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,829
Like I said, for the bigger providers,

265
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,090
that's not much of a problem
because they have that in mind,

266
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,090
they're putting documentation out there,

267
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,980
their SOC reports and things like that

268
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,710
that kind of, you know,
gives you some assurance

269
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,840
that somebody's validating
what's happening.

270
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Then with that, we as
customers can make decisions.

271
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,574
Do I trust these, the vendor?
Yes or no

272
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:03,050
because they're doing X, Y or Z.

273
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,930
That's definitely something
that we all should be doing.

274
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,333
It might be a little bit of a problem

275
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,870
when you talk about software as a service

276
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,492
or some very small providers

277
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,324
but again, it's gonna be
our due diligence aspect

278
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,270
to just be asking those questions

279
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,370
and then make determinations
from there on,

280
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,020
you know, can we live with it?

281
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,780
So that's gonna be for each,
each one of us to answer.

282
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,339
The other thing that providers can do,

283
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,283
it's education and training.

284
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:33,363
There's still, like I said,
a lot of unknown stuff.

285
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,120
Maybe you have, you
went fast to the clouds

286
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,555
and we have to move to the cloud

287
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:41,949
and maybe those risk assessment parts

288
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,626
were not analyzed in detail.

289
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:47,750
We just have to move because
we didn't want to renew some

290
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,830
licenses on premise or something like that

291
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,680
and we said let's go to the cloud.

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,050
So we need to work with
our providers to understand

293
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,439
what they offer and all encompassing,

294
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,330
not just from a technical perspective

295
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,820
but from, you know, you're regulated,

296
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,340
you have to understand how
your provider approaches that,

297
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,300
you have to make sure
what sort of, you know,

298
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,846
training they're gonna
offer in different aspects.

299
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:15,470
Remember, we're not talking
just about your engineers,

300
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,410
you need your stakeholders,
management, audit, legal,

301
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,942
all those people need to understand

302
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,810
what is it that they're walking into

303
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,099
and they need to work with the provider

304
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,820
to make sure that they have the
right level of understanding

305
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,220
of the cloud technologies
that they're adopting.

306
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,740
- Very practical approaches.
I appreciate that.

307
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,830
Thank you Roger.

308
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,380
Michee, would we like to
weigh in on that question?

309
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,490
- Yeah.
I think, you know,

310
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,200
Roger was spot on with the
transparency and the education.

311
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,274
I also think that there's
some things that people,

312
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,130
that cloud providers can do in product

313
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,980
that I've already seen
a lot of cloud providers

314
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,780
starting to do that can help.

315
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,540
One example is blueprints, right?

316
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:01,210
How do I set up GKE, Google Kubernetes

317
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,520
but just any Kubernetes container instance

318
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,199
in a way for that, that ensure
that my online retail app

319
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,960
is compliant with PCI

320
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,430
because I'm processing
payment information.

321
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,270
What does that look like?

322
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,220
Can you give me a blueprint that tells me

323
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,970
how should I set up my, you know,

324
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,680
identity and access management system?

325
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,020
How should I set up my firewalls?

326
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,670
How should I set up my networking?

327
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,229
Can you walk me through this
and give me like a blueprint

328
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,120
that gets me started and
gets me jumped started

329
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,814
because I may be coming
directly from on-prem

330
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,300
and going to the cloud

331
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,140
and I may not understand all the nuances

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,250
but you understand the
features and the products

333
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,290
that you built and how I should use it.

334
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,469
So I see a, I see blueprints popping up

335
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,580
across all the major
hyperscalers to help with that.

336
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,620
Another thing is recommendation services.

337
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,180
And I think at this point,

338
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,074
every major hyperscaler has that as well.

339
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,459
There's like AWS trusted advisor

340
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,329
and GCP has the recommendation service

341
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,597
but the idea is that
there are best practices.

342
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:03,060
And this one is actually
really interesting

343
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,400
'cause they're not just best practices

344
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,420
for security and compliance,
which are really important

345
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,959
but they're also things like, you know,

346
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,410
cost efficient best practices, you know,

347
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,807
how can you make sure that
you're not using up more VM,

348
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:17,300
VM capacity than you really need

349
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,250
and making it, running
up your bill, right?

350
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,657
So they have cost efficiency,
security compliance.

351
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:26,520
I've seen kind of like feature discovery.

352
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,600
Like we noticed that
you're, that you're using,

353
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,100
putting these three services together.

354
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,157
It looks like you're
trying to build a website

355
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:34,150
and you probably should use
these services instead, right?

356
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,750
I've seen all kinds of recommendations

357
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,970
where they're just trying to help you

358
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,040
be more efficient in the cloud.

359
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,579
And I think that's,

360
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,773
that's another way that cloud
providers in product can help.

361
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,591
And then there's stuff that,

362
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:50,640
that was already said by Roger

363
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,930
in terms of like attestations
and audit reports.

364
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,550
I think almost every
major cloud provider now

365
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,810
has self-service audit report.

366
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,839
So you can just go and
pull it down yourself.

367
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,410
You don't have to go
through some special process

368
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,819
with the technical account
sales manager and get it.

369
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,310
You can just access
it, access it directly.

370
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,959
And then they're also
leveraging third-party vendors

371
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,437
like the cloud security
Alliance or BlackRock

372
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:19,390
to run different types of
security, risk assessments

373
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,540
and self assessments
across the cloud provider

374
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,837
that can also give you a deep insight

375
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:27,850
into how they're protecting
your data in the cloud.

376
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,120
And I think those are,

377
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,280
those are the types of
things that cloud providers

378
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,650
can be doing in product as
well to help make it easier

379
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,653
for you to manage your risk on the cloud.

380
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,040
- Wow.
Just we get,

381
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,130
we keep getting better and better.

382
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,650
Great ideas.
Thank you.

383
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,840
I appreciate that.

384
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,540
Niles, I'm also gonna ask
you to weigh in on this one.

385
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,843
- All right, thanks.

386
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:57,969
I was on mute there.

387
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah.
So Michee and Roger brought up

388
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,360
really, really great
points about transparency

389
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
and laying out a blueprint.

390
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,510
And I think all of that goes back

391
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,610
to the shared security
model that we hear about

392
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,217
all the time, the concept.

393
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:15,000
What I would like to add into that is that

394
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,320
not only that we're seeing
people adopt public cloud,

395
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,550
they also shifting to multicloud.

396
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,180
And so when you shift a multicloud,

397
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,286
that means that you're gonna be exposed to

398
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,870
different kinds of hardware's,
different types of softwares

399
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,730
and things of that nature.

400
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,567
And so the idea of
falling in closely to the

401
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,730
the shared security module
becomes really difficult,

402
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,133
not only from a services level

403
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,760
but from a plat, from
different multicloud level.

404
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,329
And so just kind of,

405
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,530
I would suggest that cloud
service providers take the time

406
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,010
to help give us a good
picture about those gray areas

407
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,189
depending on the services

408
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,020
that you are consuming number one

409
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,210
and then also make sure that
that data is digestible, right.

410
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,850
I see a lot of like documentations online

411
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,720
and they're like 400 pages long.

412
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,030
And it's like, okay, well,

413
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,060
who's gonna have that eight
hours to sit down and read?

414
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,230
First of all, they don't
even have, you know,

415
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,490
in hours for professional development,

416
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,910
how are these engineers
gonna have the time to...

417
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,108
So just being able to take
whatever your suggestions are,

418
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:21,579
put it in a form that
is, that is digestible

419
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,629
and make it available
for the cloud consumers.

420
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,930
Those are just a couple
of things I would add.

421
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,470
- Yes.
But those 400 page reports

422
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,300
make great insomnia cures.

423
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,600
So, no, I'm kidding.

424
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,980
That, spot on there.
I totally agree with you.

425
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,510
You need to be able to apply what

426
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,600
you know, what's being shared

427
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,280
so that's really important.
Thank you.

428
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,113
All right.
So we're gonna

429
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:44,946
switch it up again.

430
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,770
Next question.
And Niles,

431
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,976
we're gonna start with you this time.

432
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,280
We learn through our mistakes

433
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,970
but sometimes it's even better

434
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,160
to learn through others mistakes.

435
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,193
What mistakes can you share
with our audience today?

436
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,256
- Wow, that's a great question.

437
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:04,980
What mistakes can I, that I haven't made

438
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,130
can I share with others?

439
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,430
So I cannot not be 100%
transparent in here

440
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,834
but I can share with you an
example for obvious reasons.

441
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,859
But here's what I want to share.

442
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,230
Oftentimes take for
instance, storage of buckets.

443
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,010
People don't really
understand some of the knobs

444
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,170
that they're seeing
inside of their dashboard

445
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,390
or their console and they
may think they understand it

446
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,800
and they're utilizing
these control settings

447
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,342
and what they don't
understand or realize is that

448
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:37,630
they're actually exposing
themselves to vulnerability

449
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,440
or opening up a back door
for someone to possibly

450
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,180
put possibly penetrate, okay.

451
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,873
So if we talk about the storage
of buckets, for instance,

452
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:49,000
there's a knob that
allows you to say, okay,

453
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,320
this bucket is available for
authenticated users, okay.

454
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,310
Well, who are the authentic it users?

455
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,850
In an average person's mind,
you would immediately think

456
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,850
people that I authenticate
in my environment,

457
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,090
in my enterprise, right?

458
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,320
But when you actually look at it deeper

459
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,110
to understand what that
setting is telling you to do,

460
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,490
it's saying this authenticated users

461
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,230
or anyone who is authenticated

462
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,640
from an Amazon web services perspective.

463
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,477
So not just your enterprise,
authentication matters here

464
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,990
but when you enable that
authenticated users,

465
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,250
you basically opening up
your entire tech tenant

466
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,840
to everyone who can
authenticate to search back it

467
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,580
and so that is a loophole that I see.

468
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,389
So not understanding all
what the knobs are doing

469
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,210
inside the control setting matters.

470
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,050
And so it's important to take that time

471
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,320
to understand specific
actions that you're taking

472
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,790
and what those caveats or
side-effects so to speak are

473
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,843
and how that would
affect your environment.

474
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:57,700
And I would like to also
add that tools matters.

475
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,534
You know, when we're doing all
of these things by manually,

476
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,647
we are just simply prone to errors.

477
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,756
And I know that a couple of
other people have talked about,

478
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:09,320
you know, using automation
and stuff like that.

479
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,330
So it's incredibly important that

480
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,770
you leverage automation
as much as possible.

481
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,180
And not just levels, you know, automation

482
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,990
but do some audits to
ensure that, you know,

483
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,650
you're rechecking your permissions

484
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,860
and things of that nature regularly,

485
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,974
not just kind of
configure it and walk away

486
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:30,879
but go back and check
it and make sure that

487
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,030
you're remediating as
recommended per the tool, okay?

488
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,163
So that's all I'd have to add to that.

489
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,620
- Wow.

490
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,070
Yeah.
I'm just sitting here

491
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,129
nodding my head yet
we've talked about trust

492
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,200
but verified more than once
today but it's so true.

493
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,217
You gotta understand you're
doing before you enable that.

494
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,570
So thank you, Niles.

495
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,312
I'm gonna turn to Charles
and ask that same question.

496
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,803
- Yeah.
And I gotta say once again,

497
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:58,410
Niles had a great response

498
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,380
and I was pretty much gonna
second everything she said.

499
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,240
I'd say the mistake that
I've seen most frequently

500
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,340
in my experience is
organizations have, you know,

501
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,639
decent policies set up

502
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,715
and decent, you know,
risk frameworks in place

503
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:13,909
for their cloud environment.

504
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,880
And then somebody somewhere says,

505
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,630
Oh, I just need to spin a box
up for a quick minute here.

506
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,130
You know, what could go wrong?

507
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,560
You know, I'm just gonna just
turn this on for five minutes,

508
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,649
that's it.

509
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,590
I mean, I'm sure we all
have horror stories of that,

510
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,480
of one sort or another.

511
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,460
They're sort of fall in that vein

512
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,380
but it tends to be what
I see most frequently.

513
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,050
And so I think when we're
talking about, you know,

514
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,770
what mistakes do we see
having the biggest impact?

515
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,060
I think that's gotta be it for me

516
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,139
is that sort of one-off spin up

517
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,000
that leads to a much more
significant infection

518
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,680
for the overall organization.

519
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,820
And I think the solutions
here are both policy and

520
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,370
technical and I think they
really have to be both.

521
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,870
I think you need to both
have the policy in place

522
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,796
and the employee training and
education in place to explain,

523
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:56,140
you know, why you shouldn't
do that sort of thing.

524
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,120
Because I think a lot of...

525
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,870
I think most employees know
they probably shouldn't do it

526
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,060
but they may not understand

527
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,790
just how significant
the consequences can be.

528
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,180
And so I think there's an
education component there

529
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,114
and making sure you have
the policies in place

530
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:10,760
to effectively bring
action against employees

531
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,990
that are doing things
they aren't supposed to be

532
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,386
within the organization is also important.

533
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:16,730
But I also think there's a
technical component here.

534
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,957
I don't think that that
organization necessarily,

535
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:20,270
this comes back again

536
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,350
to the overall theme of trust but verify.

537
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,909
You know, we have the policies in place,

538
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,301
we put the education in place

539
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,725
and that's the trust component

540
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,850
but I think there's a
technical component here

541
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,699
of verifying where you need to make sure

542
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,990
that you have good internal
detective controls in place

543
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,480
to detect if things like
this are coming online,

544
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,660
they're not supposed to

545
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,693
and you can also engage in
effective internal segmentation

546
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,639
to help reduce the impact if
that sort of thing occurs.

547
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,730
So I think that there's,

548
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,210
I think you really need both, you know.

549
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,790
You can't just have just
policy or just tech.

550
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,060
You need both components of that equation

551
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,499
to really be effective to help
combat that type of mistake.

552
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,500
Niles also about to
having the right tools.

553
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,710
I a hundred percent agree.

554
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,230
That's something that
I've seen as well where

555
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,780
organizations have good
incident response tools in place

556
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,230
but they don't necessarily
have cloud-based tools

557
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,700
or tools that are effective
in cloud environments

558
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,630
and that can lead to a slower
incident response time,

559
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,360
it can lead to the awkward
moment where you just don't have

560
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,646
the right tool for the job

561
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:18,750
and that ultimately can
harm the organization more.

562
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,790
So making sure you have
the right tools in place

563
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,240
and practicing with those tools,

564
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,460
going back to my previous
theme and then automation.

565
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,630
Again, I know a few folks
that talked about this

566
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,350
and I a hundred percent
agree that automation

567
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,425
is a great way for organizations
to more effectively,

568
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:38,340
more quickly respond
on average to incidents

569
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,010
by using security automation.

570
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,750
And I think it really
makes a big difference.

571
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,170
And we're talking about cloud environments

572
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,130
which are generally, you know,
very significant resources,

573
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,740
very significant amounts of data

574
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,160
being able to quickly respond to,

575
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,220
can make a big difference in many cases.

576
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,850
So I think those three themes.

577
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,360
I pretty much I'm just saying
I second everything Nile said.

578
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,209
I think those are all very key ways

579
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,964
to help improve overall security posture.

580
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,520
- Awesome.
Thank you Charles.

581
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,430
And I just I'll put in here
that I'm glad I'm not answering

582
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,570
this question 'cause if we
talked about my mistakes,

583
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,870
we'd be here all day.

584
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,340
So let's change topics here now.

585
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,090
That's great thoughts.

586
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,601
Thank you Niles and Charles.

587
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,827
Roger, I'm gonna go back to you.

588
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:23,190
There are many unspoken
assumptions underneath our layers

589
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,920
of mitigation measures that
imply very large scale risk.

590
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,500
And I think we've touched
on a few already today.

591
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,410
But another example is, you know,

592
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,030
what happens if an entire
region of a provider goes down?

593
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,152
People laugh at that but it's happened.

594
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:40,660
What, how can people look actively

595
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,121
for those risks to better mitigate?

596
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:46,240
- Sure.
If the region goes down,

597
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,073
the answer is simple.

598
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:49,110
We all go on a coffee
break and just take it easy

599
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,620
and relax, you know?
No

600
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,939
and that's what some people would say

601
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,921
but it is a real risk, you know.

602
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,930
The problem that we see out there is that,

603
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,203
again in that accelerated
path to the cloud,

604
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:04,932
some people forget that
that could be an issue.

605
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:07,920
You can spin up resources
easily in one region

606
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,680
but when you talk about
building that resiliency

607
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,990
from the beginning, what happens
if we lose the East coast,

608
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,664
if we lose the West, it will
lose Asia, whatever region.

609
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:21,660
The answer to that is we have to take it

610
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,717
into consideration from day one.

611
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,700
Ideally, when you work for modeling,

612
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,850
what would it look like
to go to the cloud,

613
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,070
you consider that, you know,

614
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,409
what happens if we lose a region?

615
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,765
What happens if we lose our provider?

616
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:37,980
Not an easy question to answer

617
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,980
because depending on your risk appetite,

618
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,332
that may have different
answers for everybody.

619
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,650
The way that we mitigate
this is by architecting

620
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,449
our cloud solutions in the proper way.

621
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:53,140
If you worry that a
region is gonna go down

622
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,030
then you need to architect your platforms,

623
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,730
your systems, your software, everything

624
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,810
to be able to gracefully
shift to another region

625
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,710
in the event that something happens.

626
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,490
We're in a good state of cloud nowadays.

627
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,410
It's very advanced, very mature

628
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,480
so the solutions are gonna be
out there for us to do that.

629
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,228
So we have to make sure we are, you know,

630
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,678
the architects and engineers doing that,

631
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:16,860
we have to make sure that
we're designing for that.

632
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,860
If we are leaders, we have
to be asking those questions.

633
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,929
Do we know what's gonna
happen if USP-1 goes down

634
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,920
or something like that?

635
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,820
will the application recover
from that automatically?

636
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,360
What's gonna happen?

637
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,969
If anybody's familiar, there's a solution

638
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,020
that Netflix developed called Chaos Monkey

639
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,379
which is a tool that they deploy it

640
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,080
and automatically starts
shutting down things

641
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,120
in their cloud platform
because they're that,

642
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,603
hundred percent sure
that whatever goes down,

643
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,760
it's not gonna affect them.

644
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,180
So they went through that exercise.

645
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,100
Of course they are an outlier

646
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,980
'cause they're super
mature in the cloud space.

647
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,040
I'd expect somebody who
just got to the cloud

648
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,670
to randomly start
turning things on and off

649
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,160
and see what happens, you know.

650
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,540
You have to have a level of
assurance that your solutions

651
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,550
where an engineer and
architect could write

652
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,669
to be able to do that.

653
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,140
The other aspect of how
we can mitigate this

654
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,220
is what Niles said earlier,
multicloud, you know.

655
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,540
If you really want to protect against

656
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,730
maybe your provider going down,

657
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,080
you need to look into multi-cloud.

658
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,139
You need to be able to
see how your solution

659
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,527
is gonna shift over to another provider.

660
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:28,780
Not an easy thing that one
cloud provider said hard enough,

661
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,200
two cloud providers or
three, it's just, you know,

662
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,670
double, triple the problem.

663
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,420
So you have to make sure that

664
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,160
if you really wanna go down this path,

665
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,320
that you understand what each provider

666
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,825
is bringing to the table and
that you have the capability

667
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:47,820
to go ahead and adapt to
how every single provider

668
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,653
is gonna do things.

669
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:51,620
So again, decisions that
we all have to discuss.

670
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,659
There's gonna be, you
know, based on the impact,

671
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,630
the cost all of that.

672
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,550
We have to make those decisions

673
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,673
based on whatever risk appetite we have.

674
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,550
- And I think that's a great point Roger.

675
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,080
I mean several great points

676
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,350
but you have to ask
those questions, right?

677
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,995
You have to 'cause if we don't,

678
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:10,060
when we're not doing the right things

679
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,110
and we know it, right.

680
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,040
So, all right.

681
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,680
So one more question that I have

682
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,044
and then we're going to open it.

683
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:23,044
We're gonna open up the
floor for general questions.

684
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,560
So Michee, I wanna turn back to you

685
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,889
to start us off on this question.

686
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,500
We tend to experience life in waves.

687
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,920
You have ups and downs

688
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,626
but overall your experiences
are in a constricted range.

689
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:40,958
Once in a while, you have truly
extraordinary experiences.

690
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,780
Whether the experience was good or bad,

691
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,103
talk about something that was
truly out of the ordinary.

692
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,470
- When I hear a question like that,

693
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,780
there's one experience that
comes to mind immediately.

694
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,143
And it probably was one of the,

695
00:28:57,143 --> 00:29:00,350
one of the most awesome things
I got to work on in my life

696
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,350
because it was a combination
of security, privacy,

697
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,409
tech, public policy and democracy.

698
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,640
And so right, democracy,
where did that come from?

699
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,650
So I was...

700
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,080
I used to be the product manager

701
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,760
of the Google transparency report

702
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,900
which is a website that we
traditionally use to put out data

703
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,020
about government overreach and
security and privacy topics

704
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,690
as well as like content
removal from Google systems

705
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,150
due to terms of service violations

706
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,810
or laws in different
countries that required us

707
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,169
to kind of hide content
in certain scenarios.

708
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,549
And as part of the Russia
meddling in the US elections

709
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,406
through the online advertising business,

710
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:48,566
the Google decided to
create a transparency report

711
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:53,566
on our political advertisers
as well as the ads themselves,

712
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,940
the political ads that run
on our system to give that,

713
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,240
you know, I think you talk
about transparency before

714
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,370
but they really bring
transparency into the process

715
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,719
'cause there was calls all
across Congress to say like,

716
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,850
we need more transparency
into who's putting these ads

717
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,169
out there and influencing
the American public quarter

718
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,430
of opinion, right and if they
are legitimately doing so.

719
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,430
And so that was the opportunity

720
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,970
to work with people in Congress,
we worked with advertisers,

721
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,343
we worked with advocacy organizations

722
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:30,410
and just to understand all
of the different things

723
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,320
that they were facing from this
information to data quality

724
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:38,689
to like understanding how
the advertising business

725
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,040
even worked and how people
were able to get it out there

726
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,873
and what should be

727
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,030
the appropriate governance
perspectives there.

728
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,100
It was just a really amazing opportunity

729
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,475
just to see how all of those
things could come together

730
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,485
in one project where that
we could land a report

731
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,639
that we thought struck
a really good balance

732
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,810
between respecting the democracy,

733
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,149
the advocacy organizations
and what Congress needed

734
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:05,610
as well as respecting the advertisers

735
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,520
and our business who were
really concerned that we might,

736
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,139
you know, unleash some
of their secret sauce

737
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,223
as we started to release this information.

738
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,070
- Wow.

739
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,250
That is definitely extraordinary.

740
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,550
So thank you for sharing that.

741
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,505
That's and that's really
exciting that the Google,

742
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,923
I assume they still do it.

743
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:28,247
- Yeah.
Actually it's expanded.

744
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:31,700
And so it's a global report from elections

745
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,170
all across the world and not
just in United States anymore.

746
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,481
- Wow.

747
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:39,610
That's awesome.
Thank you for sharing that.

748
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,879
I know I keep using that word

749
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,160
but everybody's response
has been really fantastic.

750
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,160
So I know we have some
general questions from the,

751
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,330
from our attendees.

752
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,730
So Kacy, you wanna pose those for us?

753
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,320
- Yeah.
Thanks Kristy.

754
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,370
Thanks so much to all of you.
I'm learning so much.

755
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,940
I wanna go and get trained in the cloud

756
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,430
even though I have no technical
experience whatsoever.

757
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:09,430
So this has been truly a
great ongoing event though.

758
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,271
First question we have
is about the challenges

759
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:19,470
of consolidating logs
and implement correlation

760
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,600
facing a lot of them.

761
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,169
With every tool or third party solution,

762
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,570
it seems to get, they
seem to get overwhelmed

763
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,230
with the quantity.

764
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,860
So what are some of the ways to architect

765
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,924
the logging solution and process

766
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:38,572
that might help reduce the quantity issue?

767
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,050
- Yeah.
I can take a stab at that.

768
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
It's a problem.
You know,

769
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,843
all the providers are there.

770
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:50,070
They're gonna let us
capture logs and whatever

771
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,530
and that's simple but
that is the question.

772
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,020
What are we gonna do with all those logs

773
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,900
and all those things?

774
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,605
If you move into incident response basis,

775
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,780
you're gonna need to, the solution here is

776
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,030
you have to spend some time tuning.

777
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,899
This is not too different
from what we've been doing

778
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,750
on premise historically, where, you know,

779
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,903
you have a SIEM solution
and you turn it on

780
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:16,050
when the default rules and whatnot

781
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,840
and that may work for you.

782
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,629
For a lot of people that doesn't work.

783
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,030
You're gonna have to spend some time

784
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,237
understanding your data, your logs,

785
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,240
what do you care about?

786
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,700
Do you care to receive
alerts about port 80,

787
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,089
443 being exposed, things like that?

788
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:35,490
If that's something that
you care about, sure.

789
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,156
That's a use case.
If not, go ahead

790
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:40,389
and tune it out or something like that.

791
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,290
We're gonna need,

792
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,860
we're gonna need to spend that time

793
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,232
going through our use
cases, understanding how,

794
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,139
how things happen.

795
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,340
How does data move?

796
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,384
How does a authentication happen?

797
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:53,310
How do system A talk to system B?

798
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,690
All of those things.

799
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,940
When you understand all of that,

800
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,645
all the path of the data
and all the different parts,

801
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,990
that's when you're
gonna be able to develop

802
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,165
those use cases that
are going to allow you

803
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,061
to get rid of that noise.

804
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:11,159
It's a problem again but we
do have to spend the time.

805
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,699
It's not an easy task.

806
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,460
If you're maybe a smaller shop

807
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,350
and you may need to bring
in a consultant to do this

808
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,699
because it's a very time-consuming

809
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,859
but you pay the price upfront

810
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,920
by making sure you refine your use cases

811
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,840
to avoid all that internal noise

812
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,240
of things that are gonna
be of low value to you.

813
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:32,230
- Can I interject into that?

814
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,760
- Absolutely, yes.
Thank you.

815
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,409
- Perfect.
Thank you so much

816
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,420
for bringing those things up.

817
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,840
You're absolutely right
about the fact that

818
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,487
there's a lot of noise out there.

819
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:44,290
I think about a traditional IT environment

820
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,040
where you have all kinds of devices,

821
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,592
your ideas, your IPS
and all of these things

822
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:51,529
spilling logs at you and
your routers and switches

823
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,530
and all of that.

824
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,850
And in a traditional idea environment,

825
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,610
we tend to already ignore it.

826
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,262
So shifting to the cloud,

827
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,110
it's really easy to be
overwhelmed with those noises

828
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,740
and just ignore it but
the risk are much greater.

829
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,770
And so, it's important to
try to figure out tools

830
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,670
that can help you within
your cloud environment.

831
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,030
For instance, if you're talking about AWS,

832
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,030
we know something like,
we know about CloudWatch.

833
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,140
Cloudwatch enable us to
understand what's going on

834
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,160
in terms of resources,

835
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,529
it gets us reporting on
health and performances

836
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,810
but it's extremely noisy and
it's not entirely intuitive.

837
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,250
And so there's a way you
can basically streamline

838
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,960
those logs and put it into cloud 12

839
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,400
and be able to make
sense of it intuitively.

840
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,210
So it's important to either utilize

841
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,320
the native solution available to you

842
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
or consult with a third party solution

843
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,150
that allows you to ingest those logs

844
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,150
and make sense of them

845
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,550
and even be able to action out on them.

846
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,420
And so that's one thing
I wanted to add to that.

847
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,460
- Excellent.
Thanks so much

848
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,160
for that Niles and Roger
for great response there.

849
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,096
Another question from attendees.

850
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,650
As an IT vendor risk manager

851
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,720
who monitors my third party vendors,

852
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,957
what questions can I ask to
test their security in the cloud

853
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:17,957
and what should my responses
to their answers be?

854
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,553
- So I'm happy to take this one.

855
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,080
So we talked about this
a little bit when...

856
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,784
The key things that you wanna
ask them are gonna be around

857
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:43,440
whatever risk framework
that you've chosen,

858
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,850
I think you're gonna wanna look at...

859
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,440
I'ma talk primarily for like a security

860
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,580
and privacy background 'cause I don't have

861
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,000
some other background in
other areas of the cloud.

862
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,360
But the things that we're
gonna wanna look at is

863
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,030
the way to access.

864
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,420
I think one of the biggest,

865
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,250
one of the biggest sticking points

866
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,620
that a lot of customers have is

867
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,190
because I'm moving from on-prem

868
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,980
where I control all the operations, right,

869
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,530
I know who's accessing my data,

870
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,435
I know the way that they're doing it.

871
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:14,799
I can tell you like
what processes they use,

872
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,530
whether they have to use
multifactor authentication

873
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,880
to access to data,

874
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,700
I can tell you what type
of perimeter security

875
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,533
that I've set up,

876
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,487
I can talk about what the
physical access is to it,

877
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:27,500
to the data,

878
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,130
I can control kind of my
own insider risk posture.

879
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,535
When you move to a cloud provider,

880
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:35,747
you're actually sharing that

881
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:37,520
and the question that comes up is

882
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,880
how close is your security posture

883
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,900
in insider risk to mine, right?

884
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,840
So that I can know that you're
doing some of the same things

885
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,490
that I would do with that same data

886
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,089
had it still been on on-prem
where I can control it.

887
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,870
And so you'll see questions

888
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,120
or you should ask questions about like,

889
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,120
how do you do physical
access into the data center?

890
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:01,843
What are the processes
for the tech support,

891
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:06,843
for support engineers, for
site reliability engineers?

892
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:11,578
All the people who could possibly
have access to that data,

893
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,870
how do they go about getting that access?

894
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,770
Is there a multi-party approval system?

895
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,622
Is there a multifactor authentication?

896
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:21,359
What type of device can
they access it from?

897
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,660
Is there...
Is it...

898
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,980
How do you know that
that device is trusted?

899
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,580
You know, what type of monitoring

900
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,950
do you do around that access?

901
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,410
And so that's a really big one

902
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,140
I think that comes up quite a bit.

903
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,549
And those are the kinds of questions

904
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,390
that you should be asking
your cloud provider

905
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,759
and making sure that you have a good,

906
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,517
a good understanding of it.

907
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,133
And a lot of people to mitigate that risk

908
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,073
is they leverage encryption.

909
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,900
And if you're gonna be
leveraging encryption

910
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,720
to mitigate the risk of someone, you know,

911
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,642
data leak, data leaking and
some getting access to data

912
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:53,370
that they're not supposed to

913
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,529
then you need to understand like

914
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,710
if you're using the cloud
providers encryption mechanism,

915
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,090
how secure is that?

916
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,530
How are the keys generated?

917
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,170
Who has access to the keys?

918
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,610
Can anybody besides me
decrypt my data, right?

919
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,747
Those are the kinds of things
that you'll also have to ask

920
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,080
when it comes to access.

921
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,481
The other thing that comes
up quite a bit is like,

922
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,690
how do you monitor your
own security posture?

923
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,710
Because top providers will say things like

924
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,066
we use this type of hardware
to maintain hardware security

925
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:25,299
and most cloud providers if they're good,

926
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,870
they will have a multi-layer
security approach.

927
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,420
That's hardware, software network,

928
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,140
they'll have multiple layers of it.

929
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,890
And you wanna understand
like, how do you monitor

930
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,379
and how do you do incident management

931
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,970
and how will I be made aware
of an incident that happens

932
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,799
that can impact my customers

933
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,130
or impact my workload and availability.

934
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,550
Those are the types of questions
that you also have to ask

935
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,130
because as mentioned before,

936
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,510
you wanna make sure not only that

937
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,800
they're technically sound

938
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,160
and have the right technical controls

939
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,060
but you also wanna make sure

940
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,897
they have the right operational controls

941
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:57,630
and that they're continuously monitoring

942
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,350
and keeping that up to date.

943
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,440
And then the, I think the
final thing that you should ask

944
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,530
as a customer when they
evaluate the cloud provider is

945
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,782
how do you help me

946
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,081
with my part of the shared responsibility,

947
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:12,030
my part of the shared responsibility model

948
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,310
as you mentioned earlier?

949
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,770
For example, if I, let's
say I live in Europe, right?

950
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,450
And I think a lot of us have
probably dealt with GDPR

951
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,283
at some point

952
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:24,420
and you may have some needs

953
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,640
where data has to remain in
Europe in data regionalisation.

954
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,440
How do you help me store
my data in region, right?

955
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,690
How do you help me classify my data

956
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,090
so I know what's personal
data and what's not?

957
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,140
What are the tools that are
available on top of your

958
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,560
platform to ensure that data doesn't leak

959
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,913
when the email goes out
or when I have data,

960
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,109
you know, moving across the wire?

961
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,870
These are the things that you wanna know.

962
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,848
Like, do you have controls that I can use

963
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:53,970
and turn my risk knobs
up and down as I need?

964
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,549
So those are some of the
questions that I think

965
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,800
you should dig into with
your cloud provider.

966
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,740
- That was such a thorough response.

967
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,761
Thank you so much Michee.

968
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,463
We have two questions remaining

969
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,867
that I hope to get in
these last four minutes.

970
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:10,560
Compared with the traditional
incident response procedure,

971
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,230
what components should be added

972
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,873
into cloud incident response procedure?

973
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,180
- I can really jump on this one.

974
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,490
So a couple of key
components here I'd say,

975
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,390
make sure you're the right tooling

976
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,120
for cloud specific incident response.

977
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,158
But then beyond that,

978
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,160
when it comes to the
really the nitty gritty

979
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,080
of how an organization should best prepare

980
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,690
for a cloud based incident,

981
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,680
the big challenge for me to
give real broad based answers

982
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,730
is that it's gonna be different
based on each organization.

983
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,100
It's gonna be different
based on, you know,

984
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,457
your relationship with that
cloud, with your cloud provider,

985
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,480
that's gonna be different
based on the type of data

986
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,180
you have stored in your cloud environment

987
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,339
and how you're using it

988
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,717
and how it interacts with
your business continuity.

989
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:50,530
So I'd say that it's
beyond saying, you know,

990
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,930
make sure you have the
right tools in place

991
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,029
for incident response

992
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,380
and make sure that you have cloud specific

993
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,620
and some response plans in place

994
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,460
that involve interacting with

995
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,552
your cloud provider in some capacity.

996
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,410
It's difficult to provide really

997
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,432
in-depth detailed analysis without looking

998
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:08,270
from kind of an organization
to organization level.

999
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,380
But I think taking the
time as an organization

1000
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,790
to get that specificity and
really dig deep into cloud

1001
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,620
into your cloud-based incident response,

1002
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,863
I think will be a time well
spent for the organization.

1003
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:26,020
- Yeah, I just wanna
add something quickly.

1004
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,400
It's right on, you know,

1005
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,980
we have to understand exactly
what's happening in our cloud.

1006
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,440
Part of how we gonna achieve that

1007
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,590
is gonna be doing something like game days

1008
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,473
or something like that,

1009
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,902
sort of like captured a
flag or something like that.

1010
00:42:38,902 --> 00:42:41,810
Hands on table tops,
whatever you wanna call it

1011
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,759
but you have to put your people

1012
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,919
who are the responders
out there on the cloud.

1013
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:49,658
Of course don't do any production
'cause that's never fun.

1014
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:52,110
Have a lab or something where they can go

1015
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,890
and touch this stuff.

1016
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,549
Everything looks fine on
paper until something happens

1017
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,860
and you have to go ahead
and grab a snapshot

1018
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,860
or make some change or something
or isolate a broken machine

1019
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,600
or something like that in the cloud.

1020
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,680
It all looks good on paper

1021
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,669
but you need to do that

1022
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,460
for space of the process preparation.

1023
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,700
You need to play ahead,
you know, plan ahead,

1024
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,710
play ahead of something happening.

1025
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,410
Do it before, you know,

1026
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,580
something happens 'cause
you must be ready.

1027
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,720
And when something happens,

1028
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,640
it's not that time to be,

1029
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,500
trying to figure out how to use the tools.

1030
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,490
So just make sure that
everybody's aware of that.

1031
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,780
- Yeah.
And just to piggyback off

1032
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,930
what both of them are saying,

1033
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,839
some of the, I think one of the key things

1034
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,270
that people have to really
understand is the logs.

1035
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,436
When you move to cloud,
like the logs are key

1036
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:43,260
to being able to do like digital forensics

1037
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,686
and understand what happened

1038
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:48,250
and to go back and replay a
scenario and figure it out.

1039
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,130
And some of the things that,
some of the issues is that

1040
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,770
people are used to looking at logs

1041
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,009
and interpreting logs in
their own phone system

1042
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,530
and then they get it
from the cloud provider

1043
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,420
and they don't know how to make
heads or tails of it, right.

1044
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,100
And if you're in a multicloud scenario

1045
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,670
as someone said before, it's
even, it could be even harder

1046
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,020
because in AWS logs may
not look like Azure logs

1047
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,920
which may not look like GCP logs.

1048
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,940
And so the same things that
you are used to looking in

1049
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,830
at one cloud provider,

1050
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,779
you may be looking for
it in a different way.

1051
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,060
And so being able to
test and make sure that

1052
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,330
the GK, that container logs
that you get from one system

1053
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:24,870
maybe you're using Docker
versus the GKE container logs

1054
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,740
that you're getting from GCP,

1055
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,669
that those logs have
the data that you need

1056
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,264
to be able to do those investigations,

1057
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:31,640
it's gonna be really key

1058
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,150
because if you have the right tools

1059
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,960
but you're not feeding it the right data,

1060
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,090
then you also won't be able to,

1061
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,300
to kind of get the threat
intelligence that you need

1062
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,620
to understand what happened
and to be able to come up

1063
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,380
with some control that will
prevent it in the future.

1064
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,009
- And I wanna add to that

1065
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,950
because this is a
definitely hot topic here

1066
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,049
that you brought up here.

1067
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,560
I wanna add, maybe give
me 30 seconds or so.

1068
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,029
So personally in cloud security at Cisco,

1069
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,140
I can be very...

1070
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,935
I can share this with you guys that,

1071
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:03,440
you know, when you're talking
about incident response,

1072
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,530
we actually level out tools to do that.

1073
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,640
One of the things we wanna
know is that first of all,

1074
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,109
do you even know every entity

1075
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,630
that's available in your environment?

1076
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,320
Do you see every conversation

1077
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,970
that's going on in your environment?

1078
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,009
Do you understand what's normal?

1079
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,828
Or you know, are you alerted
when something change?

1080
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:25,310
Are you able to respond to a threat

1081
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,180
and take action immediately?

1082
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,549
At Cisco, we use what's
called Secure Cloud Analytics

1083
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,100
that allows us to do this.

1084
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,279
And this is just one of the tools

1085
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,750
like Michee was talking about.

1086
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,060
There are several tools that we use

1087
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,810
and we do this tabletop exercises.

1088
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,290
So definitely it's important
to have a thorough,

1089
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,236
you know, a thorough cloud visibility

1090
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:46,623
in terms of posture for what you have.
