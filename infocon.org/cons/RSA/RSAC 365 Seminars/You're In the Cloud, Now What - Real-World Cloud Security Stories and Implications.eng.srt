1
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,380
(blowing raspberry)

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,510
- Hey buddy, not feeling well?

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,460
- Oh my gosh, I am so tired.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,400
- Hey, what's the matter champ?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,165
- I got the alert fatigue, bro.

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,395
(loud noise)

7
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,979
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,709
- Hello and welcome to You're
In The Cloud, Now What?

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,780
If you're joining us live,

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,540
our speaker will be answering questions

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,360
in the post session discussion forum

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,730
immediately following the presentation.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,870
The forum link is available

I now like to turn it
over to Charles DeBeck

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,083
for the presentation.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,924
- Great. Thank you so much.

19
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,190
And thank you everyone for attending,

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,879
very excited to talk to you today.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,030
My name is Charles DeBeck.

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,670
I'm a threat intelligence
expert over here at IBM.

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,610
And today we're going to
talk about cloud security.

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,589
Yeah, the main topic I
want to kind of cover is,

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,460
we've been telling folks
that you should be moving

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,140
into the cloud for a lot of reasons.

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,950
But what happens once
you're actually there

28
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,140
and what concerns should you have

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,490
looking at cloud environments
as you move over?

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,070
The main two topics we're going to cover

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,250
during this presentation are first off,

32
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,130
how threat actors are getting
into cloud environments

33
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,649
and using cloud environments
once they're in there.

34
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,560
And then what you as an
organization can do to help prepare

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,819
and respond to cloud
incidents more effectively?

36
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,230
A lot of this data is based off of

37
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,570
our internal IBM data from our
incident response capability.

38
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,402
So it's kind of cool.

39
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:33,230
We can draw off of a lot
of use cases that we've had

40
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,400
to better understand what
cloud environment security

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,393
is looking like at this this time.

42
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,950
So before we really get
into the nitty gritty

43
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,440
of our research, I kind of
want to take a step back

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,450
and explain how we got to this point.

45
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,400
So on average organizations are
about 20% of the way through

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,620
their transition to cloud environments.

47
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,110
And for anyone sort of in the
security space for the last

48
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,850
few years, we can all attest the fact that

49
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,520
generally organizations
they've been moving

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,490
over to cloud environments because of

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,806
all the security benefits
that they offer, excuse me.

52
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:08,550
But then there's a question
that comes up in my mind of,

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,000
well, if we're telling everybody to move

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,690
into cloud environments for
all these great reasons.

55
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,020
For scalability purposes
or for centralized security

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,390
and centralized data storage,

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,179
what happens once everybody's there?

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,290
What happens for an organization
from a security perspective

59
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,400
once you've completed or
become close to completing

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,900
your transition into
the cloud environment?

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,350
And this was really the research question

62
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,609
that drove our efforts
here is, what happens next?

63
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,490
And so to find out more
information about this,

64
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,120
we looked at incident
response data or cloud related

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
incidents that we observed
over the previous year.

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,180
So that's sort of how
we got to where we are

67
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,343
and the questions we
were looking to answer.

68
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,300
The first question, of
course, that came up was,

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,110
who's targeting cloud environments?

70
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,210
And sort of unsurprisingly
the primary answer here

71
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,750
was cyber criminals.

72
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,130
I think this makes a lot of sense.

73
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,290
Realistically, cyber criminals make up

74
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,260
the preponderance of
threat actors in general.

75
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,390
There's just a lot of
cyber criminals out there.

76
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,570
There's a lot of value
to cloud environments

77
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,500
from a cyber criminal perspective.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,540
As we continue to sort
of centralized resources

79
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,910
and capabilities in cloud environments,

80
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,123
they're becoming more convenient

81
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,100
and easier to secure for organizations.

82
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,870
But they're also becoming treasure troves

83
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,300
for cyber criminals.

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,270
If you're looking for the crown jewels,

85
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,410
generally cloud environments

86
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,410
are where these crown
jewels are moving to.

87
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,280
So it makes sense that
criminals would be targeting

88
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,663
cloud environments as well.

89
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,670
In addition to them being
generally beneficial

90
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,549
for criminals to target.

91
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,830
Cloud environments are
becoming even easier

92
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,610
for cyber criminals to target overall.

93
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,397
The sophistication level
required to effectively target

94
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,959
the cloud environment is dropping,

95
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
because a lot of criminals
are helping each other out.

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,670
They're providing tutorials
on underground forums

97
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,503
and marketplaces.

98
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,809
They're providing public
cloud access keys for bargain

99
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,830
basement prices at dark web markets.

100
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,660
So we see a sort of an
interesting combination here

101
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,950
of the value of cloud
environments is increasing.

102
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,910
The challenge of getting into the field,

103
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,859
of targeting cloud
environments is decreasing.

104
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,217
So it sort of makes sense
that we would see an influx

105
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,253
of cyber criminals
moving in this direction.

106
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,133
That's not to say that they're

107
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,920
the only folks that we observed.

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,849
We also saw nation states targeting

109
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,420
cloud environments as well.

110
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,709
And these sort of advanced
persistent actors, again,

111
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,039
sort of, to me make intuitive
sense to be targeting

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,810
cloud environments because
as they continue to pursue

113
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,460
their victims and pursue
particular nation state interests.

114
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,159
Cloud environments will
almost certainly be involved

115
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,810
in attempting to get that information

116
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,643
that they're looking for.

117
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,630
So it sort of makes sense that
we would see nation states

118
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,930
continuing to be active in this area.

119
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,210
But I'd say overall cyber
criminals still make up the

120
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,063
majority of activity we're
observing in this space.

121
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,820
So the first statistic that I
think is really fascinating.

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,330
The question is how are
threat actors getting

123
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,039
into cloud environments?

124
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,370
In 45% of the cases that we observed,

125
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,270
remote exploitation of cloud applications,

126
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,770
was the initial infection vector.

127
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,180
And I think this is sort of mind blowing

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,520
for a couple of reasons.

129
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,780
First off, it's suggest that
almost a majority of the cases

130
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,909
are the result of one
infection vector primarily,

131
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,030
remote exploitation of cloud applications.

132
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,549
So to me, that indicates that this is

133
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,790
a very, very popular and
very, very common way

134
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,510
for threat actors to be
targeting cloud environments.

135
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,719
It also to me, really
emphasizes the criticality

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,230
and challenge of defending
cloud applications.

137
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,040
Not every cloud application is the same,

138
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,317
there's a lot of unique snowflakes in

139
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,180
the cloud application environment.

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,490
And as a result, it becomes
challenging for organizations

141
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,030
to defend their cloud environment

142
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,130
when they're hosting all sorts
of different applications,

143
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,580
with different capabilities

144
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,229
and different security
requirements at the same time.

145
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,800
In addition to cloud applications,

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,790
another common way that
threat actors got into cloud

147
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,720
environments was through
misconfigurations.

148
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,410
And this continues to be an issue

149
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,330
that's plaguing organizations.

150
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,530
Over one billion records
were lost just in 2019

151
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,799
due to cloud misconfiguration issues.

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,990
And this is something that I think

153
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,050
from a threat actor perspective
is sort of a slam dunk.

154
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,590
Realistically, misconfigurations
are one of the easiest

155
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,810
things for an organization to, I'm sorry,

156
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,620
for a cyber criminal to take advantage of.

157
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,270
It requires very little sophistication.

158
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,490
At the same time, misconfigurations
are a very great way

159
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,050
for threat actors that
pullback a lot of data at once.

160
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,350
Oftentimes when we observe
cloud misconfigurations

161
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,180
being used to pull back records,

162
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,840
the volume of records being
pulled back was significantly

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,330
higher than with traditional
misconfiguration issues.

164
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,280
So we see threat actors
targeting misconfigurations

165
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,909
because they're so effective,
but require so few resources

166
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,360
and are really easy to automate.

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,250
So that I think this is
something that has been an issue

168
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,630
for the last year or so,

169
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,330
and will continue to be an
issue into the near future.

170
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:57,050
Another key way that
threat actors were getting

171
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,780
into cloud environments in our study

172
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
was cross-cloud compromise.

173
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,630
Which is when threat actors
break into one cloud environment

174
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,020
and then use that initial access to break

175
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,510
into another cloud environment.

176
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,070
I think what's really interesting
about this methodology is

177
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,140
that it uses the fact that
organizations have multiple

178
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,407
cloud environments oftentimes
in their organization,

179
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,000
to their own advantage.

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,980
If I'm an organization

181
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,570
and I know that I have two
cloud environments that interact

182
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,409
frequently for a
legitimate business reason,

183
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,760
if a threat actor breaks into one of those

184
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,450
cloud environments and then uses

185
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,680
that to leapfrog over to the other,

186
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,260
it could be very difficult
to detect that activity.

187
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,566
It really challenges my
internal detective controls

188
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,960
because I'm expecting there to be traffic

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,409
between those two environments.

190
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,200
And it requires very precise,

191
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,849
very fine tuned detection rules.

192
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,220
Otherwise it will be very
difficult to find threat actors

193
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,810
trying to use this cross cloud attack.

194
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,130
I think this is something
that we haven't seen a lot of

195
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,320
based on our numbers.

196
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,760
But it is something that
from an intuitive perspective

197
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,310
on my end, it makes a lot of sense.

198
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,530
And I could see this being a
way the threat actors continue

199
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,080
to try and get into cloud
environments into the future.

200
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,219
And I think this is a good
chance for organizations to get

201
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,370
in front of the eight ball here
and help protect using these

202
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,830
detective controls
internally to protect against

203
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,930
this sort of activity.

204
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,119
Okay, so we know who's
targeting cloud environments.

205
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,050
We know how they're getting
into cloud environments.

206
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,330
How are threat actors using
these cloud environments

207
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,030
once they're in there?

208
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,400
Unsurprisingly, the
number one malware winner

209
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:33,323
or cloud-related security
incidents was ransomware.

210
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:36,179
This has sort of been the
most popular tune of 2020.

211
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,270
So I don't think anybody should
be super surprised to see

212
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,210
that leading the charge here as well.

213
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,929
And realistically cloud
environments are critical to a lot

214
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,329
of business operations,

215
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,830
meaning that they can't
have significant downtime.

216
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,890
Well, that entails is that
ransomware is a great choice

217
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,250
for threat actors, compromising
cloud environments.

218
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,970
Because if you can't have downtime,

219
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,830
and you're critical to the
operation of the business.

220
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,770
Ransomware is a great way
to have a high probability

221
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,090
of getting a payout.

222
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:05,290
So ransomware here is very,
very popular across spectrums,

223
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,650
and it's also very popular
in cloud environments.

224
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,240
Makes sense.

225
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,730
When we'd suffered actors
not using persistent malware

226
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,190
or not using sort of a
persistent access mechanism.

227
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,590
Just sort of a smash and grab
into a cloud environment.

228
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,260
Data theft was the most common way

229
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,030
that they leverage their access.

230
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,290
And again, this is one that I think is a

231
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,122
pretty straight forward.

232
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,850
Because if you're gonna smash
and grab into an environment

233
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,530
that has tons of data and
tons of valuable information,

234
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,980
and you want to be able to
turn around and sell that.

235
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,130
Using data theft as a
non-persistent attack

236
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,880
is a very effective way to do that.

237
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,939
Crypto mining also was
something we observed

238
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,040
from a malware perspective.

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,670
But that was nowhere near
the levels of ransomware.

240
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,459
But I think crypto mining is
interesting because it really

241
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,990
takes advantage of the
vast computing resources

242
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,430
and scalability components
of cloud environments

243
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,270
to be more effective.

244
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,500
But when we're talking
about overall numbers,

245
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,630
ransomware very significantly
outpaced crypto miners.

246
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,040
So even though we might've
seen crypto miners being used

247
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,349
very frequently in a more
traditional server-based

248
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,210
environment, if we look at the numbers

249
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,080
sort of across the previous year.

250
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,820
Crypto miners were a
much higher by comparison

251
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,570
in traditional server environments.

252
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,100
In cloud environments, not so much.

253
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,930
We tended to see ransomware
and more significantly compared

254
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,180
to their more traditional
server counterpart.

255
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,670
One element I also found
interesting was that a lot

256
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,640
of organizations hosted DNS
services in cloud environments

257
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,069
and threat actors would actually go in

258
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,020
and compromise these DNS servers.

259
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,920
So essentially they would just
reroute the organization's

260
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,620
internet traffic based on their needs.

261
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,840
There's a lot of theoretical
possibilities as to what you

262
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,300
could do with this as a threat actor.

263
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,260
I mean, just thinking off hand to me,

264
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,569
the most obvious thing would
be to redirect an entire

265
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,510
organization's user
base to my exploit site,

266
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,180
trying to take advantage of
browser based vulnerabilities

267
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,349
and then get further penetration
into the organization.

268
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,470
And on the end points
around the organization,

269
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,033
making it really difficult
to route out my attack.

270
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,440
In reality, what we tended
to observe in these attacks

271
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,460
tended to be a DNS rerouting
to advertisement sites.

272
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,660
A threat actor would
set up a Google ad site

273
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,760
or what have you and redirect
a bunch of traffic to it

274
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,490
so that they would get money.

275
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,240
But the nice thing about this
attack is that it's a very

276
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,470
short-term quick profit attack.

277
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,950
It doesn't require any
real sophistication.

278
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,620
It just requires that the
threat actor redirects

279
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,220
the activity to a site and
then they get money for it.

280
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,190
It's very easy to monetize
your access this way

281
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,880
from a threat actor perspective.

282
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,160
And if you get booted out tomorrow,

283
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,219
well, you got the money
you could and you're fine.

284
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,940
It's not really a
long-term planning attack.

285
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,310
So I could see why threat
actors would engage in this sort

286
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,099
of form for DNS compromise.

287
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,140
But I think from an
organizational perspective,

288
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,449
if I'm looking at how I'm
going to best protect my

289
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,740
organization, I would really
consider the risks associated

290
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,540
with DNS compromised being
significantly higher.

291
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,089
And therefore the need to
make sure that cloud-based DNS

292
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,663
is well protected, is very
high in my book again.

293
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,637
One sort of interesting
trend that we observed,

294
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:01,949
and this was along with our
partners over in Tether,

295
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,610
was that malware in general is evolving

296
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,490
to target cloud environments
more effectively.

297
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,840
And this is something that I
wanna spend a little time on

298
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,550
because if I'm a threat actor,

299
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm not going to spend my
hard earned money or my time

300
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,760
or my effort on malware that
I don't think is going to

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,500
provide value for me.

302
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm only going to spend
all my resources on malware

303
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,880
evolution and malware development
that I think is going to

304
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,510
ultimately make money back for me.

305
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,020
And so what this indicates to
me is that threat actors are

306
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,439
targeting cloud environments
and recognize that there's

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,080
money to be made by
targeting cloud environments.

308
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,740
And so therefore these resources
being expanded indicated

309
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,860
there's gonna be a longterm interest here.

310
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,270
This isn't just a flash
in the pan targeting

311
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,620
cloud environments, but then
next year there'll be gone.

312
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,180
This indicates to me that threat
actors are really trying to

313
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,453
go after cloud environments
in the longterm.

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
In terms of how we see malware evolving

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,890
in cloud environments, is
a couple of different ways.

316
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,550
First off threat actors are
learning how they can use a

317
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,120
cloud environment to scale
their operations very quickly.

318
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,950
They're also learning that
they can use their malware to

319
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,640
leverage cloud environments
as operational infrastructure,

320
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,439
which I think is really kind of cool.

321
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,870
Essentially what you do here is

322
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,420
you infect a cloud environment.

323
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,350
You deploy your malware
within that environment,

324
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,590
and then you can have other
bits of malware call back

325
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,100
and use the cloud environment
that you already infected

326
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,010
as C2 infrastructure.

327
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,990
Now you like to think of yourself.

328
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,430
Well, Charles, threat
actors have been doing this

329
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,760
with traditional server
environments for years,

330
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,090
what's so exciting about them doing this

331
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,370
in the cloud environment?

332
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,910
Well, I'm glad you asked.

333
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,900
Realistically cloud environments have a

334
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,300
much larger overall profile
and have a much better

335
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,640
reputational profile than
traditional server environments

336
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,850
pound for pound.

337
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,370
And so it becomes much more challenging,

338
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,260
I think to protect and
spot malicious beacons,

339
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,860
going out to a cloud environment,

340
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,920
than you'd observe for malicious call out

341
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,980
to a traditional server.

342
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,490
Because the reputational
score of a cloud environment

343
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,560
like AWS or IBM Cloud,

344
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,469
or what have you is going to
be significantly greater than a

345
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,810
random server that got
popped as being used

346
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,609
for malicious traffic.

347
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,400
Again, a lot of these evolutions

348
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,060
and a lot of ways we see
cloud environments being used

349
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,729
by threat actors may not necessarily...

350
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,804
It sort of falls into
one of two categories,

351
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,740
either the short term,

352
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,680
let's just get money from this
cloud environment and leave.

353
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,089
Or a longer term,

354
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,070
let's use this cloud
environment to our advantage.

355
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,440
Let's take advantage of this
access and compromise to make

356
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,410
our other attacks more effective

357
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,670
and more difficult to detect.

358
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,439
And while I think the numbers
sort of show that the smash

359
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,900
and grab techniques, the
short-term techniques

360
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,569
were more common and more frequent.

361
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,470
To me personally, I think
the long-term techniques

362
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,880
of using cloud environments
to make their other attacks

363
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,050
more effective is ultimately
where we're going to

364
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,979
start seeing threat actors go,

365
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,780
as we start sort of patching the holes

366
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,310
that are allowing these
smash and grabs to happen.

367
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,459
So that's why I'm spending a
lot of time focusing on how

368
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,020
that's evolving.

369
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,670
So I think that's really
interesting that we're seeing

370
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,910
malware continue to
evolve, continue to grow

371
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,100
and become more effective
in cloud environments.

372
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,010
Which I think will
ultimately lead to continued

373
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,163
cloud targeting for
the foreseeable future.

374
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,452
Okay. So at this point
probably, you've heard,

375
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,900
who's targeting cloud environments,

376
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,720
how they're getting
into cloud environments,

377
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,160
what they're doing once they're in there.

378
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,459
And you heard all the bad news.

379
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,950
I want to change over
now to the good news.

380
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,750
What can you as an organization do

381
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,190
to better prepare your organization

382
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,190
for cloud related security incidents

383
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,663
and respond to cloud-related
security incidents.

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
On the preparation side,

385
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,780
the number one thing I can
recommend is to make sure

386
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,270
that your organization
has a cloud specific

387
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,410
incident response plan in place.

388
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,990
And that this incident
response plan has been tested

389
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,770
over and over again.

390
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,699
And a lot of organizations
might say, "Well,

391
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,730
I do have a ransomware incident
response plan in place."

392
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,580
But the immediate question
should be, that's great,

393
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,150
but do you have a cloud
specific ransomware incident

394
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,750
response plan in place,
because that will be different.

395
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,600
There'll be different tools
that need to be involved,

396
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,010
there'll be different
partnerships that need

397
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,920
to be leveraged depending on
the nature of your relationship

398
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,449
with your cloud provider.

399
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,650
There'll be different
personnel that are pulled in

400
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,740
for a cloud environment based breach.

401
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,360
And just having a ransomware
incident response plan

402
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,390
isn't sufficient to
ensure that you'll be able

403
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,300
to respond promptly.

404
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,770
In addition to having a
cloud specific incident

405
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,939
response plan, I highly
recommend that organizations

406
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,980
use a cloud specific monitoring

407
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,110
and misconfiguration checking
service or capability.

408
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,810
Pretty much what I'm trying
to say here is make sure

409
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,430
that your monitoring
tools and detective tools

410
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,380
within your cloud environment
are cloud specific.

411
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,590
And this might seem a little
redundant with the first one,

412
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,990
but I think that there's a
difference between having a good

413
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,310
response plan that's cloud
specific versus having good

414
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,010
detective controls that
are cloud specific.

415
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,240
You might've heard me mentioned
over and over again in the

416
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,660
first few slides here,

417
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,599
how detective controls I
think are absolutely critical

418
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,639
to effectively protecting an
organization against attacks.

419
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,359
And to making sure that
the attack is stopped

420
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,790
as quickly as possible.

421
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,020
And making sure that this is done

422
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,109
in a cloud specific fashion
will help an organization

423
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,852
better protect themselves
against cloud related threats.

424
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,400
In the same vein setting
up logging activity,

425
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,200
for cloud environments, I
think is very, very helpful.

426
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,790
And logs are one of those things

427
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,750
that it's not super interesting, right?

428
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,400
And a lot, a lot of
people are sitting there

429
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,930
talking to themselves
saying, "Man, I love logs."

430
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,280
They're so cool.

431
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,680
But they're also something
that you can't do

432
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,130
after the fact, right?

433
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,360
Once an incident has
occurred or once an incident

434
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,240
is ongoing, you can't say, "Man,

435
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,550
I wish I had logs leading
up to this incident."

436
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,990
It's something you have to set up today,

437
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,440
so that when it comes up in
the future, you're set to go.

438
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,890
So taking a moment to make
sure that you have effective

439
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,740
logging setup for your cloud environment,

440
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,320
I think is absolutely critical.

441
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,270
So that when an incident does occur,

442
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,393
you have those logs already set to go.

443
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,190
And then sort of in line with
the first recommendation,

444
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,075
clearly defining the roles
and processes for response

445
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,510
is very, very helpful for organizations.

446
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,940
Making sure everybody
knows what they're doing,

447
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,230
how they're doing it, will
make it so they're able

448
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,550
to respond more quickly,

449
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,629
contain the incident more effectively.

450
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,530
And make sure you don't have
overlapping responsibilities,

451
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,260
or you don't have issues
of gaps in responsibilities

452
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,240
that you didn't realize.

453
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,930
Ultimately, most of these
issues I think can be resolved

454
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,410
for an organization by doing
effective tabletop exercises

455
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,680
or by doing effective
cyber range exercises

456
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,960
involving cloud environments.

457
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,190
I know it's something that a lot of people

458
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,360
may not have experience with,

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,699
or it may not be something
that's approachable for all

460
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,390
organizations, but if you can
do a cyber range exercise,

461
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,940
I think it's something
that's very, very beneficial

462
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,880
because it allows your organization to

463
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,660
approach a cloud-based
incident from a tactical

464
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
and operational level,

465
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,010
not just a strategic level like
you would traditionally see

466
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,700
in a tabletop exercise.

467
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,400
But really at a lower level
and make sure that the

468
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,870
individual operators are more
keenly aware of how they would

469
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,979
respond to a cloud-based incident.

470
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,480
And that will really allow an
organization to understand,

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,180
what are the gaps in the armor?

472
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,760
What issues might we have
with our response plan?

473
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
So we can address those in
preparation for a potential

474
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
incident rather than finding those out

475
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,253
as an incident is ongoing.

476
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,750
Okay, so that's what we
can do ahead of time.

477
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,140
What happens once you have
a cloud related incident?

478
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,080
One of the things that
we observe oftentimes is

479
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,960
that organizations tend
to reimage machines.

480
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,060
That just kind of say,
"Well, that one's infected,

481
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,980
nuke it from orbit.

482
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,430
Let's get a new one in
here and call it a day."

483
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,700
The biggest risk and as
arguably one of the big benefits

484
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,750
of a cloud environment, right?

485
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,330
That you can re-emerge
machines very, very easily.

486
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,510
It makes for simplicity and
it sort of simplifies your

487
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,460
IT infrastructure, which
is one of the big perks.

488
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,120
But from a forensic standpoint,

489
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,860
and from an incident response standpoint,

490
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,879
you lose a lot of valuable data
by just instantly re-imaging

491
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,760
and saying, "We're just
going to get rid of it."

492
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,210
Because then all the forensic
artifacts that might be on

493
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,010
that machine that could tell
you what else the threat actor

494
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,560
was doing, what the threat
actors motivations were,

495
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,440
or where they were hoping to
get to, who the threat actor

496
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,130
might be or what their intention might be?

497
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,490
All that valuable information is gone,

498
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,120
you just got rid of it.

499
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,600
So if you can instead isolate the system,

500
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,050
take that data back and redeploy,

501
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,610
instead of just re-imaging the asset,

502
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,689
you're able to more effectively pull back

503
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,070
that forensic data, take
the information from there

504
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,490
and really do in-depth
analysis to make sure

505
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,100
you've ultimately addressed
the issue of the incident.

506
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,709
And all the potential avenues

507
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,760
that threat actor went
down after the fact.

508
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,379
Rather than sort of
wandering around in the dark,

509
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,630
hoping that you got
everything you needed to.

510
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,070
One element of incident
response for a lot of folks

511
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,480
forget about with cloud
environments is bandwidth costs.

512
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,610
And that's simply the
fact that say you have

513
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,546
a number of infected of assets
in your cloud environment,

514
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,960
and you want to pull down
all that information.

515
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,110
All those forensics artifacts
I was just talking about

516
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,610
and you want to pull them
down so you can research them

517
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,000
internally and figure out what happened.

518
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,037
That is a lot of data to be pulling down.

519
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:10,770
And a lot of cloud environments
may charge based on

520
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,280
the amount of data being
pulled down at any given time.

521
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,850
And suddenly you might find
yourself facing massive

522
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,100
bandwidth costs that
you didn't really expect

523
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,469
because you're pulling down
a bunch of information.

524
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,670
This is something that can
definitely be handled ahead of

525
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,720
time by looking at the
contracts you have with your

526
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,110
cloud providers or by looking at,

527
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,260
how can we more effectively
pull down this information

528
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,713
in a way that's cost affordable for us.

529
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,320
But this is something that
when you're responding,

530
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,050
don't forget about this element,

531
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,320
because this is something that
if you do forget about it,

532
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,030
it can really cost you at the end.

533
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,419
Making sure you have the
right investigative tools,

534
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,920
is absolutely critical
to an effective response.

535
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
And this, once more, it gets back to

536
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
the concept of cloud specificity.

537
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,350
A lot of times the tools that
are used for investigations on

538
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,639
traditional end points or
traditional servers may not work

539
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,730
effectively in a cloud
environment or may not work

540
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,180
as effectively in a cloud environment.

541
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,670
And so having the right
investigative tools is very,

542
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,950
very helpful for organizations
to help make sure

543
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,260
that they're able to respond effectively.

544
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,010
And then there's automated
incident response.

545
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,730
And I really can't say
enough how important,

546
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,660
I think automation is in
effective incident response.

547
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,100
Realistically automation
allows organizations to respond

548
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,733
more efficiently, faster,

549
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,409
with generally lower false positive,

550
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,970
false negative rates to
incidents than human operators,

551
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,300
oftentimes because it's so fast,

552
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,030
they can just pull back tons
and tons of valuable data.

553
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,830
So anything you can do to automate your

554
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,409
incident response process
will help your organization

555
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,310
better protect itself in the long run.

556
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:52,480
So that concludes the overall
topics I wanted to cover here,

557
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,060
talking about our IBM cloud
security landscape report.

558
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,590
This is a very brief
covering of a 10 page report.

559
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,510
I highly recommend you
check out the entire paper,

560
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,470
if you have any additional questions.

561
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,770
I think ultimately threat actors recognize

562
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,660
the value of cloud environments.

563
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,270
We see their TTPs evolving to target

564
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,800
cloud environments more effectively.

565
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,120
We see their malware evolving to target

566
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,820
cloud environments more effectively.

567
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,460
We see dark web forums
and dark web marketplaces,

568
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,460
increasingly offering cloud
related services, capabilities,

569
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,590
and access, which I think
to me all spelled out

570
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,260
the fact that criminals
across the board see

571
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,030
that organizations are
moving into the cloud.

572
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,230
And based on the data
that we're collecting,

573
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:37,219
they're likely to continue
targeting cloud environments

574
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,530
into the near future.

575
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,620
Which means that if your
organization is using

576
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,570
a cloud environment or
is thinking about using

577
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,350
a cloud environment in the future,

578
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,149
that you need to be aware
of how these evolutions

579
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,280
are taking place.

580
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,550
So that you can best protect
yourselves at this time.

581
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,040
And there are definitely
positive steps that you can take

582
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,520
to both prepare yourself,

583
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,450
as well as more effectively respond.

584
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,793
If a cloud environment
related incident is to occur.

585
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,230
Thank you all so much for taking the time

586
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,610
to talk to me today.

587
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,669
Just as a reminder,

588
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,060
I'll be in the discussion forum available

589
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,649
to answer any questions you have.

590
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,720
So hop on over to the Networking
Lounge at networking live,

591
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,160
and thank you very much for your time.

592
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,210
Enjoy the conference.
