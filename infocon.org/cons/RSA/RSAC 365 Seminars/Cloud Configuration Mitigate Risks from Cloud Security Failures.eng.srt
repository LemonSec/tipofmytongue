11
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,343
for the presentation.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,383
- Welcome to this virtual series.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,380
It's really good to have you
guys join our discussion today.

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm Niles Pyelshak,

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,480
and I'm super excited to
spend some time talking about

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,113
cloud risk and mitigation
with you guys today.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,710
You may be wondering
why I chose this topic

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,780
and why I want to have
this discussion with you.

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,750
Well, you know what,

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm really glad you asked .

21
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,630
Trend Micro's research
finding indicated that

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,190
cloud misconfiguration was
the most prevalent cause

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,470
of cloud security issues
for businesses today.

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,880
What they also find was that

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,210
about 230 million misconfigurations

26
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,410
happen on a daily basis on an average.

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,640
Okay, and even beyond that,

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,640
what they also found was that
95% of IT decision makers

29
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,553
are super concerned about
cloud misconfiguration

30
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:32,020
because they consider it a
data security risk, right?

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,179
So these are fats that have
been researched and reported

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,230
and you can actually look it up yourself.

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,892
To take it out a little bit further,

34
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,210
DivvyCloud also did a study

35
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,679
and what they discovered was that

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,550
in the years of 2018 and 2019,

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
that companies paid about $5
trillion in data breaches.

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,029
Okay, so that's $5 trillion dollars

39
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:06,550
that was spent by companies that reported

40
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,310
not to mention those that
did not report, okay?

41
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,110
That's a lot of money, okay.

42
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,940
So that's one of the reasons
why I wanna have this

43
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,410
discussion with you guys today.

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,802
But first I wanna talk about
who am I and why am I qualified

45
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:22,329
to have this discussion with you guys?

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,330
My experience come from
10 plus years of IT work,

47
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,670
spanning a broad range of disciplines

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,783
from systems engineering
to network engineering.

49
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,760
I've designed data centers.

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,940
I've implemented data centers
for Fortune 500 companies.

51
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,040
I've also be able to do virtualization

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,000
for Fortune 500 companies.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,030
So I have a vast amount
of experience there

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,293
and obviously now in cyber security.

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,119
Currently though, I drive
cloud security adoption

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,053
for Cisco systems.

57
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:03,053
And as you can see there I'm also CCIE.

58
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,100
All right, so let's talk
about cloud configurations

59
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,883
and what are some of the
issues that we're seeing?

60
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,530
Well, first of all we cannot deny the fact

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,200
that enterprises are adopting cloud

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,480
and they're adopting cloud

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,530
because of a lot of different benefits

64
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,510
that are available to them, right?

65
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,840
Some could be for agility,

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,840
some may be for the reasons of
driving down operating costs.

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,990
It could be to gain competitive advantage,

68
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,084
or for whatever reason
that you are adopting

69
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,840
cloud infrastructure solution,

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,070
you should do so securely, right?

71
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,200
There are different kinds of
service providers out there,

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,237
you know about, Microsoft Azure AWS.

73
00:03:58,627 --> 00:03:59,930
Google has its own.

74
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,900
Many other companies
have their own flavors

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,380
and they all provide
this to customers, okay?

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,323
So if you think about a
traditional data center,

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,029
what you would see is that most
customers had a data center.

78
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,243
They had to acquire the
hardware for that data center

79
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:21,860
that will bring it in, that burn it in

80
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,483
and then they will roll
it out to production.

81
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,450
By the time they will adapt to production,

82
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,560
maybe it's a server that
they've made available

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,620
for engineering, okay?

84
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,600
At that point, that engineer
that's using that server

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,320
is not concerned about
security at all, right?

86
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,510
And typically they just start, you know,

87
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,039
they hop onto the servers,
they load the application,

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,620
do whatever they need to do

89
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,570
and they feel pretty secure doing that.

90
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,320
Now, when you shift to
operating in the cloud,

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,590
what has essentially happened

92
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,530
is that you've shifted your perimeter

93
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,070
and you've shifted back
to what's the cloud

94
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,830
and essentially you've expanded
your attack surface, right?

95
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,349
And now when you're operating the cloud,

96
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,670
things are a little bit different, right?

97
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,600
It's really easy to just within
seconds create an instance

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,363
in the cloud and do
whatever you have to do.

99
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,150
But you know, there is a
responsibility for security

100
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,700
that you have to make sure that you obtain

101
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,640
for your environment, right?

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,719
So usually there's a huge
question about who's responsible

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,700
for what, okay?

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,469
Is the cloud provider responsible for this

105
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,470
or am I responsible for
that as a cloud consumer?

106
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,700
Well, we have this particular
slide that I have up here that

107
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,969
basically uses a picture of
the shared responsibility model

108
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,980
that's out there, okay?

109
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,840
When we're talking about
the cloud service provider,

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,020
the bottom there is what you see

111
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,960
that they're responsible for.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,849
Okay so let's unpack that a little bit.

113
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,123
So if you are a cloud service provider,

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,810
you are responsible for
securing the compute.

115
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,670
You're responsible for
securing the networking.

116
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,270
You're responsible for
securing the storage

117
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,900
and everything that runs the cloud.

118
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,690
That is the responsibility of
the cloud service provider.

119
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,100
So the hardware, their
software that runs to cloud.

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,300
the databases, all of that stuff

121
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,300
it's the responsibility of the
cloud service provider, okay?

122
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,429
They even, for the physical data centers,

123
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,180
they have physical security,

124
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,650
that's the responsibility of
the cloud service provider.

125
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,299
Okay, now if you pivot
that to the customer.

126
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,400
What is the customer
responsible for in the cloud

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,053
infrastructure, right?

128
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,080
The top picture right here
that you see is what are the...

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,229
These are the items that the
customers are responsible for.

130
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,430
Basically everything that's in the cloud.

131
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,950
So you have customer data,
that's your responsibility,

132
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,240
the applications that you
use in the environment,

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,180
that's your responsibility, okay?

134
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,190
Identity and access management,
that's your responsibility

135
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,650
to configure operating system,

136
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,010
your networking, your virtual firewall.

137
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
That's the responsibility
of the cloud consumer, okay?

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,400
So that's essentially the
model that we need to follow.

139
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,090
You may hear some people argue about,

140
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,489
Oh, it really depends on
the services here and there,

141
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,830
but essentially in my opinion,

142
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,560
you should also always consider that

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,130
if you can make any
change in the environment

144
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,170
as a root user,

145
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,100
the general rule is that it's up to you

146
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,090
to secure that, okay?

147
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,900
Now let's talk about some common
types of misconfigurations

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,159
that we see in the cloud infrastructure.

149
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,881
So what are the common misconfigurations

150
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,631
that we see in cloud?

151
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,490
The first one I wanna talk about is IAM.

152
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay IAM stands for, identity
and access management.

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
And these is actually a tool
that the cloud service provider

154
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,360
provides to cloud consumers,

155
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,910
so that they can create users and groups

156
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,380
for their enterprises, okay?

157
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,317
It's called IAM.

158
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,300
And what we found out according
to research is that IAMs

159
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,460
or identity and access
management is an extremely common

160
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,059
security weakness in the
cloud infrastructure, okay?

161
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,569
So that's why I wanna talk about it today.

162
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,570
Yes, IAMs are you know, you are
responsible for that, right?

163
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,857
This tool is provided to you
by your cloud service provider

164
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,530
and you have to configure it.

165
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,150
Then you have to make sure that
configured in a way that is

166
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,132
safe for your enterprise, okay?

167
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,683
Take for instance, a root user.

168
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,170
They should never be anyone
in your environment that has

169
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,360
access to everything, okay?

170
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,396
If you use, take for instance,

171
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,610
they have their root user,

172
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,630
they may have assess to create services,

173
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,410
implement services, configure them, right?

174
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,650
That person, they should not be someone

175
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,709
using the user root username and password

176
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,470
to make configuration
changes in your environment.

177
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,480
But this is actually
happening with you have users

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,450
that are able to perform
all kinds of action

179
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,800
in your entire environment.

180
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:40,020
That's extremely dangerous, okay?

181
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,853
Why?

182
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,153
Say for instance, that person,

183
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:46,490
what if they share those credentials

184
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,400
with other people, right?

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,100
In a traditional IT environment,

186
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I remember a password that
was stuck on a sticky note

187
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,210
and everybody all use that same username

188
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,740
and password, right?

189
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
You want to avoid that

190
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,640
and if you have one person who has access

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,350
to a full reign to your environment,

192
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,590
it's really hard to avoid that.

193
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,200
That's one thing, right?

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,693
Number two things, how
do you perform audits?

195
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,339
How do you know who's doing
what in the cloud environment?

196
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,810
Right?

197
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,819
And let's say something happens

198
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,573
and you piss that employee off, right?

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,680
So you piss that employee off
that person has full reign

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,693
in your cloud infrastructure,
guess what they could do?

201
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,810
Well, they may open up back doors

202
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,089
in your cloud infrastructure.

203
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,240
They may open up services.

204
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,280
Essentially they may
become an insider threat

205
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
to your organization, right?

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,896
And what are you gonna do? Fire him?

207
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,599
Well, let's say you do that.

208
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,960
You fired them, what you
are essentially doing

209
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,930
is making them become an outsider threat

210
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,489
because they have full
reign in your environment,

211
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,470
what they have, they may
have created some back doors,

212
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,490
some inside doors,

213
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,720
start some new services
that you were not aware of.

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,790
Well, it's just really, really
it's one of the problems

215
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,270
that we're seeing is that people

216
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,380
are giving full ban access
to so many single users

217
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,300
in their environment and
that is a misconfiguration.

218
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,050
The second thing I wanna talk
about is the lack of MFA.

219
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,890
MFA stands for multi-factor
authentication, okay?

220
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,360
Multi-factor authentication
is basically a simple tool

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,423
that gives you an added
layer of protection, okay?

222
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,160
You will be so surprised
to know that a lot of

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,184
cloud platform consumers
are not configuring MFAs.

224
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:44,872
There are not, right?

225
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,310
We are accustomed to, in the
traditional IT environment,

226
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,260
we are accustomed to the
server admin, you know,

227
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,800
using the active directory
to create a domain,

228
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,979
create groups, create users.

229
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,580
That groups maybe like, you know,

230
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,340
your HR group, your marketing group,

231
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,410
or perhaps your engineering group

232
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,350
and then grabbing use and
dropping into those groups

233
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,510
and giving them the permissions
that they need, okay?

234
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, when you shift
into the cloud, it's...

235
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,583
Well, first of all, once you
give them those permissions,

236
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,240
those are the user
credentials that they use

237
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,580
to log into those services
in your environment, okay?

238
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,640
But it's important to take
that additional step and say,

239
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,960
okay, well, I know that
you can verify, you know,

240
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,050
use them in password,
what else can you verify?

241
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,069
And MFA allows you to add
that layer of protection

242
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,544
for your environment.

243
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:45,622
And you can configure it for attendance,

244
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:47,742
you can configure it for our service APIs,

245
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,330
you can configure it for
IAM users, it's important.

246
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,650
And you can actually put a
soft token on your following

247
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,951
that people can use or
you can actually provide

248
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:02,450
a hardware token that
there users carry about.

249
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,610
But you know what?

250
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,470
This is one of the
misconfigurations we see

251
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,303
in the environment.

252
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:10,270
It's just that people are just
not configuring MFA, okay?

253
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,199
But that's just the word on the street.

254
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,120
The next thing to talk
about there is unsecured

255
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,500
credentials, right?

256
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,780
Are you creating strong password policies

257
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,163
for your enterprise?

258
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,210
Okay, I know some people
like the government agencies,

259
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,093
those are required to
actually use complex passwords

260
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:36,620
and they use that and they
follow those protocols,

261
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,250
but there are some enterprise
that are not doing so.

262
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,325
And so it's important
for you to evaluate that

263
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:46,070
and find out if you are using...

264
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,550
Well, first of all, do you
even have rules in place?

265
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,260
If you don't, what do you need to do

266
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,140
to get that created, right?

267
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,160
Do you create groups in your environment?

268
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,430
Do you add users to that environment?

269
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,989
Do you appropriate permissions?

270
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,690
Do you perform audit?

271
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,920
Because if you're not doing these things

272
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,300
then, you're setting yourself
up for an opportunity

273
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,689
to be attacked, okay?

274
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,000
So that's four IAM.

275
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,710
Those are just really quick
things that you may be able

276
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,170
to go back to your environment

277
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,990
and be able to quickly make some changes

278
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,990
and provide some added
benefit in terms of security

279
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,573
in your cloud infrastructure.

280
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,010
Now for security groups.

281
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,410
Security groups are
basically firewall, right?

282
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,390
In a traditional IT environment,

283
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,150
you may have your data center

284
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,963
and when you have that data center,

285
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,990
all customers that I
have not met a customer

286
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,110
that don't have a firewall in place, okay?

287
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,100
That firewall is basically the
guy that stands at the gate

288
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,320
and say, well, you know, your
protocol 22, you can come in.

289
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,120
Your protocol 23, no you can not come in.

290
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,880
Basically it filters what goes in and out

291
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,250
in your environment.

292
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,310
And that's what happens in
the traditional environment.

293
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,229
Most enterprises have
that hardware firewall,

294
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,303
perimeter firewall.

295
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,720
And when we go into the cloud,
it's no different, okay.

296
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,450
You need to have security groups.

297
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,810
That's the terms we
use, the security groups

298
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,359
that allows you to basically filter

299
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,030
what comes into your services,

300
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,819
the content into your cloud infrastructure

301
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,700
and what goes out.

302
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,470
And what we're seeing is number one,

303
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,680
they are improper attachment.

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,120
What does that look like?

305
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,710
Basically what I'm
referring to is the idea

306
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,780
that you have good intentions

307
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,250
and you create perhaps 10
different security groups, right?

308
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,210
You create 10 security groups
because you have possibly,

309
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,060
let's say 10 services, 10
different services, okay?

310
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,920
And you applied the
security to those groups.

311
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,650
What happens when let's say
you have an additional service

312
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,930
that's coming up, maybe it's
a file server that you need

313
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,420
to create an instance for, right?

314
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,050
If you go in there and just
go ahead and grab whatever

315
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,140
security groups is available there,

316
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,353
you can possibly improperly
attach the wrong filtering

317
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,890
to that file server, right?

318
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,840
It's kind of like, possibly
grabbing a web server

319
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,800
or web application security group

320
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,189
and applying it to a file server

321
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,870
that may contain your PIIs,
maybe even crown jewels.

322
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,030
It just doesn't make sense.

323
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,540
So what we're seeing a lot
is improper attachment.

324
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,689
So it's important to kind
of survey your environment,

325
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,290
find out are you improperly
attaching security groups

326
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,560
to the wrong services, okay?

327
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,010
We are also seeing some
default attachment.

328
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,610
So people just outright
saying, well, you know what?

329
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,220
I needed to get this up and running.

330
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,650
I created maybe two or
three security groups,

331
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,569
and then I'm gonna just
repeatedly use that

332
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,570
across all my infrastructure, okay?

333
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,230
That is a misconfiguration
and can open up a lot of

334
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,740
opportunities or increase
your attack surface, you know,

335
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,540
beyond just being a cloud consumer, okay?

336
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,260
Unrestricted ports and protocols.

337
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,800
So like I was talking to
you about the firewall

338
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,149
in a data center,

339
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,660
that firewall is the guy
that decides what goes out

340
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,540
and comes in

341
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,819
and in a traditional IT environment,

342
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,550
we have security engineers.

343
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,129
That is your sole job is to
make sure that what comes in

344
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,410
and out on a daily basis
is allowed and permitted.

345
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,242
They determine...

346
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:28,079
Okay, I want to allow a source
from wanda wanda wanda one

347
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,189
to come into my environment or not, right?

348
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,340
When you shift into the cloud,

349
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,100
that is still a requirement, okay?

350
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,389
Because if you go out there
and what you essentially do

351
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,500
is if you open all the ports
in your security groups,

352
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,880
because that was the simplest
and quickest thing to do,

353
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,260
when you open all the
protocols in your security,

354
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,580
because that's the easiest thing to do,

355
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,990
from all sources and to all destination,

356
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,000
that's another misconfiguration
that you are basically

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
putting in your environment.

358
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,340
So we're seeing a whole lot of that.

359
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,409
So it's important for
people or cloud consumers

360
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,860
to take their time to
evaluate their environment,

361
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,000
to see, you know, this security
group that I've created.

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
It's a web application.

363
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,409
Well, at the very least I know I need 180

364
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,510
and I also need 4403 and
perhaps you'd even need 80,

365
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,290
but you need to identify
those ports that you need

366
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,909
and only allow exactly what you need

367
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,990
to those services, okay?

368
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,780
All right, so for storage,

369
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,379
this is really, really interesting.

370
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,133
You have to think about,

371
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,910
are your storage publicly
assessable to the internet, right?

372
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,410
What we're finding is that a
lot of customers are not aware

373
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,740
if there storage is actually
publicly accessible, okay?

374
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,560
This could pose a huge risk, okay?

375
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,460
In terms of data breaches,
like I mentioned,

376
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,520
maybe you have a file server that has PIIs

377
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
or the crown jewels, right?

378
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,990
You wanna make sure that

379
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,910
they're not publicly available, right?

380
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,740
In fact, I wanna share
an example with you.

381
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,250
Sometimes when you're
configuring your in AWS,

382
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,400
if you go into your control settings,

383
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,400
you might see a button that
says authenticated users, okay?

384
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:24,643
If you see authenticated users
and you to an average person,

385
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,520
you may think, well, what this means

386
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,860
is that people that would have access

387
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,693
to the storage or authenticated
users for my enterprise.

388
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,190
And that's an error, okay?

389
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,580
But authentic unit users
in that particular feature

390
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,760
is indicating anyone,

391
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,129
any customers that can be authenticated

392
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,000
to Amazon Web Services, right?

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,380
So tenant A and now the
authenticated to tenant A

394
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,070
and because they are AWS customers,

395
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,629
they can now have access
to your environment.

396
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,280
That's a huge risk.

397
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,280
That's a huge risk because
when you operating in the cloud

398
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,170
and you've increased your attack surface,

399
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,360
that means that the attackers
are constantly scanning

400
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,193
the internet.

401
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,960
What they wanna find is
someone who's just out there

402
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,500
that has not put up the firewalls,

403
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,357
that have not put up the tools
to protect their environment.

404
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:27,530
And this is one way that
data is getting compromised.

405
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,363
Logging.

406
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,270
Yes, you'd be very surprised to also know

407
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,260
there's a lot of enterprises
that are not logging things

408
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,280
in their environment, right?

409
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,820
There's no object versioning.

410
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,800
How do you know what to roll back to

411
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,540
if you're not recording these things?

412
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,270
And if you're not
logging, how do you know,

413
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,540
how can you go back and review that data

414
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,290
and find some security gaps
you can now close, right?

415
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,540
It's very, very important
to do these things

416
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,460
and what we're seeing is that, you know,

417
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,180
people are just not doing these things.

418
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,500
So these are a few of the common
types of misconfigurations

419
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,280
that we're seeing in according to research

420
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,183
in cloud environment.

421
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,320
Now, what are the common
causes of these things?

422
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,078
Of these misconfigurations?

423
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,481
There are several of them

424
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,940
and here I have listed a few of them.

425
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Number one is just that
shared responsibility model.

426
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,230
People just don't understand
where that line is, right?

427
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,180
They question it

428
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,230
and so they don't take the
time to understand which aspect

429
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,910
is their responsibility to
protect for the environment.

430
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,370
And like I said, for general rule,

431
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,760
what I always suggest
is that if a root user

432
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,920
has access to that service, okay?

433
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,667
Then it's your responsibility
to protect, okay?

434
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,470
And so that's what I always suggest,

435
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,030
but that's one of the common causes,

436
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,883
we don't understand where
that line is drawn at.

437
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,300
Default configuration.

438
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,909
A lot of people are using
the fall configuration.

439
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,740
Well, we knew that any
organization has access

440
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,810
to a lot of different
services to be able to deliver

441
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,610
what they in the market for.

442
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,610
So default configuration,
can not be enough for them

443
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,889
to protect the entire environment.

444
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,610
So that's one of the causes.

445
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,500
Quick spin ups.

446
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,530
Yes, this one is huge, right?

447
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,120
We have before the pandemic, right?

448
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,439
There were a lot of engineers
that will go to the office

449
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,970
and do their work, right?.

450
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,310
Now, post pandemic, a lot of
people are working from home

451
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,310
and in some environment it's
required for a developer

452
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,790
to file a ticket

453
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,870
and when they file that ticket,

454
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,770
they go ahead and wait for
someone to create that instance,

455
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,740
apply the correct security groups,

456
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,210
and then turn around and say,
hey, here's your instance.

457
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,730
You can go do whatever
you need to do, right?

458
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,650
Now, an engineer is saying,

459
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,480
well, I know how to
create an EC2 instance.

460
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,950
So I'm gonna go ahead and create that

461
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,600
and I'm gonna grab the
default configuration

462
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,159
for security groups and apply
it to my instance, right?

463
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,680
And what they forget is that
there are some security aspects

464
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,790
that they may be opening themselves to,

465
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,340
they may be some security issues

466
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,060
with that default attachment or something

467
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,040
that they need to protect
that they may not be aware of

468
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,550
and they mean well, right?

469
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,020
These developers or
engineers they mean well.

470
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,250
They want to be productive.

471
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,440
They don't want to be held
back by the process, okay?

472
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,920
And sometimes it's really
easy when they finish,

473
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,650
they forget about that.

474
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,020
They may have had intentions
to go back and protect

475
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,487
and put the proper security grip on there,

476
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,450
But it's really easy to forget that.

477
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,790
And so that's one of the common causes.

478
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,123
A lack of policies, lack of templates.

479
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,129
You should basically have
some pre-determined policies

480
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,850
that the template and build
for your users to consume.

481
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,970
All right, well we are
also noticing is that

482
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,210
there's a lot of lack of expertise, right?

483
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,720
In this day and age, a
lot of people are saying,

484
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,652
Oh, I know how to sing the song ABC.

485
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,130
And so what am I gonna do?

486
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm gonna go to YouTube,

487
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,050
and I'm gonna become an expert.

488
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,010
I'm gonna sing the ABC song

489
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,330
because I'm an ABC expert, right?

490
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,949
And that's just maybe taken
a little bit out of context

491
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,170
but essentially there are a lot of people

492
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,360
that are creating YouTubes and blogs

493
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,889
and they don't really have the expertise

494
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,410
to be teaching people
on cloud infrastructure.

495
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,930
And if you don't train your users,

496
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,160
they're going to resort
to those free resources

497
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,010
that may not be accurate.

498
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,843
And so that's what we're seeing,

499
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,693
there is a lack of
expertise, a lack of time.

500
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,910
We have cloud admins that don't have

501
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,090
professional development time

502
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,139
to learn what they need
to learn to do their job

503
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,160
and obviously because of budget, right?

504
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,930
So this is some of the common
causes that we're seeing

505
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,040
that's leading to loosen misconfigurations

506
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,270
in the environment, right?

507
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,300
So now what can we do about it?

508
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,560
What can we do to go ahead and mitigate

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,760
from some of these
things that we're seeing.

510
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,563
Excuse me.

511
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,640
There are several things that we can do

512
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,990
to begin to mitigate from some
of these misconfiguration.

513
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,820
The first thing I wanna
bring to our attention

514
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,669
is security baseline.

515
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,400
Do you have a security
baseline or not right?

516
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,010
No matter what industry you are in, right?

517
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,129
We all have regulations that
we must adhere to, okay?

518
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,890
Perhaps you can use that as your baseline

519
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,527
for your environment

520
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,130
but don't stop there.

521
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,350
Define specific security templates

522
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,110
for your environment yourself

523
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,500
in addition to the compliance requirement,

524
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,900
the compliance control, okay?

525
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,110
This for the current
misconfigurations like I said,

526
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,419
Trend Micro said that
there's about on a given day,

527
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,940
there's an average of 213
million misconfiguration.

528
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,140
How many are in your environment, right?

529
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,863
Use tools to discover
those misconfigurations.

530
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,260
Be pro-active.

531
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,570
What are you doing in your
environment to make sure

532
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,570
that you have visibility into
these misconfigurations, okay?

533
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,980
At Cisco systems we like to
actually eat our own dog food.

534
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,500
So whatever we're putting out
there, we like to consume it.

535
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,190
And there's a tool that
we are actually using

536
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,960
that is a Cisco solution,

537
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,770
it's called the Cisco
Secure Analytics, okay?

538
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,910
Cisco Secure Analytics.

539
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,390
This guy enables us to know every entity

540
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,120
that is in the environment.

541
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,530
This guy enables us to know,

542
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,610
to see every conversation.

543
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,290
Are you able to see every
composition in your environment?

544
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,690
Are you able to understand what's normal?

545
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,110
Are you able to know
when something changed?

546
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,070
Do you get alerted when
something does change?

547
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,510
Are you able to respond to the
threat really quickly, right?

548
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,750
And remediate, right?

549
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,700
This is what Cisco
Cloud Security Analytics

550
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,533
allows you to do

551
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:21,060
and we actually use that
at Cisco cloud security.

552
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,000
So in essence,

553
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,730
this is the Cisco secure cloud analytics

554
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,730
allows us to have visibility
into your network,

555
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,060
allows you to get reporting
in your environment

556
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,067
and allows you to identify any threats.

557
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:41,540
And I'll ask you to identify

558
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,270
IoC's indicator of compromise, right?

559
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,770
And policy verification

560
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,000
and that's something that
I wanna share with you guys

561
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,040
there that you might be
able to take a look at

562
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,893
and see how that might help
you in your environment, okay?

563
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,480
Do you leverage the
principles of list privilege?

564
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,530
Do you leverage that in your environment?

565
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,230
There are several tools
that will allow you

566
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,550
to do that, right?

567
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,580
There are several tools that
will allow you to look through

568
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,852
your environment and say, you know what?

569
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,020
I give this person 10 permissions

570
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,629
and they actually need nine.

571
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,880
Let me take that 10 to
one (indistinct), right?

572
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,040
So you can use tools to do
that and automate, okay?

573
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,740
Automate your spin ups,
automate with your templates.

574
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,053
These are things that
can actually help you.

575
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,940
And so with that said,

576
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,380
I wanna end my conversation
with you is that we know

577
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,100
that cloud adoption will only continue

578
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,949
to grow significantly, okay?

579
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,960
Make sure that you take
the time to leverage,

580
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,770
to share the responsibility model,

581
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,020
figure out what your responsibilities are

582
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,730
to protect your environment

583
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,980
and then the cloud service
providers will also do

584
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,257
what they need to do to
protect your environment.

585
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:52,300
And that completes my
discussion for you today.

586
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,419
Thank you for joining us.

587
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,060
See you next time.

588
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,893
All right, guys.

589
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:59,050
Also feel free to hop over
to the networking lounge

590
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,470
and I'm gonna be over there
addressing your Q and A.

591
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,330
So feel free to meet me over there.

592
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,879
So let's have a discussion
and let's talk about it.
