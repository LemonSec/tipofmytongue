00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,210
- Hello, and welcome to

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,400
Enhancing Visibility for
Cloud Security Operations.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,730
If you're joining us live

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,680
our speaker will be answering questions

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,040
in the post session discussion forum

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,759
immediately following the presentation.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,210
The forum link is available
in the networking lounge.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,970

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,363
for the presentation.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,610
- Alright Casey, thank you
very much I appreciate it.

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,680
So yeah, welcome everybody.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,643
My name is Roger O'Farril

15
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,920
and I'm gonna be talking to you today

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,110
about how we're going to
be enhancing visibility

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,710
in cloud security operations.

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
Definitely something that

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,000
hopefully is gonna be of value to you.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,350
Before we start talking about that,

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,090
we have to consider how we got here.

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,700
You know, how we've been
getting to the cloud.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Part of that has been with
digital transformation

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,010
I'm sure you've heard those words

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,670
out there a lot, it's everywhere.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,503
So it's the you know,

27
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:09,503
raced to reinvent the way that
business you know do things.

28
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,009
Part of that is, you know
technology infrastructures

29
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,340
and the cloud has been
playing a big big role

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,360
in that digital transformation.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,290
So as a result of that, we are being asked

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,670
by our you know, companies
to move quick and fast

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,670
and with agility and part of
that translates to the cloud.

34
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,880
We need to stand infrastructure,

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,399
we need to deploy applications
and all what that entails

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,760
quickly on the cloud.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,820
And as part of that,

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,279
we're gonna see throughout
this presentation

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,500
that there's a lot of
challenges for us in security.

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,480
And hopefully we're gonna answer today

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,830
the question of you know,

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,890
how are we gonna gain back that visibility

43
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,870
that we're losing to some
extent as we move to the cloud

44
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,230
maybe again because we're
doing it at the speed of light

45
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,380
or something like that?

46
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,240
But you should leave
today with some ideas of

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,470
how are we gonna be
attacking that problem.

48
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,210
So in that journey to the cloud

49
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,230
either you're starting, you
might be in the middle of it,

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,010
or maybe you were done with it.

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,420
It could be one of two things,

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,320
it could be something like

53
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,519
the right side of the picture here

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,630
it could be all green grass and blue skies

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,280
because you did your planning,

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,780
you understood why you were walking into

57
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,200
and that's ideally
that's what would happen.

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,640
But again due to that speed to market

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,470
that we need to achieve
and do things quick,

60
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,890
maybe it looks something
like the picture on the left,

61
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,809
you know it could be gloomy
and you can have some issues

62
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,070
and things that need to
be fixed and addressed.

63
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,763
But regardless of where
you stand in there,

64
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,399
it's a good idea to understand

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,010
what are the security implications?

66
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,030
What are the challenges?

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,300
What it's going out there with,

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,520
you know security on
the cloud and visibility

69
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,230
and all the topics that we're
gonna be talking about today?

70
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,299
To understand that I'm
put into perspective

71
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,490
I like to reference the ISC squared

72
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,413
cloud security report some fairly fresh.

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,190
The four of the first
questions that they ask is

74
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,210
to the people who responded,

75
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,720
how concerned are you about
the security of public cloud?

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,210
And look at that number 94% said,

77
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,310
I'm somewhere between moderately concerned

78
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,943
to really, really concerned.

79
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:24,900
That tells you a story
about security in the cloud.

80
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,713
You know, it's in everybody's mind.

81
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,730
I'm pretty sure some
people are losing sleep

82
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,920
because of that but it's a challenge

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,510
and there's a concern
and we need to address it

84
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,403
and again plan for it and execute.

85
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,260
The other question that they ask

86
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,010
what is it that you're concerned about?

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,609
So the two big buckets,
data loss or leakage

88
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,320
and privacy and confidentiality issues.

89
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,810
No surprise for anybody hopefully

90
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,720
these are the breaches that
we're seeing out there a lot.

91
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,523
You know, we're seeing
buckets exposed, PII,

92
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,810
you know confidential information

93
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,430
that it keeps getting exposed

94
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,100
and that is definitely reflected here.

95
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,090
Also in that survey they ask,

96
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,490
so what's going on?

97
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,230
What are the exact issues
that you're having?

98
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,429
Look at the biggest one,
the lack of qualified staff.

99
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,540
We're gonna talk more about that today

100
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,247
and we're also going to talk
about the one below that a 33%

101
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,959
the visibility issue which
is what we're here for.

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,770
Those are gonna be highly related,

103
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,049
we're gonna see you know,

104
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,380
they're gonna be part of the equation

105
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,380
that we're gonna use to solve
this visibility problem.

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,980
The other big issue that we have

107
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,500
and we also gonna talk
in a lot of detail today

108
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,740
is going to be tools 'cause

109
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,770
we need to solve this in part with tools.

110
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,120
So we're gonna go ahead
and see how that plays out.

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,970
The problem that we have,

112
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,780
here we have 82% of the people

113
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,020
who responded to that survey saying,

114
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,130
I am somewhat confident in my tools,

115
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,159
in the cloud all the way to you know,

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
they're just not working.

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,810
So we're gonna see how we
can resolve that problem

118
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,550
of tooling in the cloud.

119
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,720
Hopefully you'll leave here with you know,

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,100
the answers to those questions

121
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,260
but before we do that,

122
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,650
we have to understand
what are those challenges

123
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,520
that we're talking about here

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,539
in regards to visibility on the cloud?

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,010
And to understand that

126
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,530
I like to put it to the light
of the different cloud models.

127
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,900
When we start talking about on-premise,

128
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,260
you know typical IT infrastructure

129
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,187
we have either our own data center

130
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:34,090
or colocation facility
or something like that

131
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,340
it's been easy for us.

132
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,250
We got it, we understand how that works.

133
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,290
You know, it's a stack of servers

134
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,560
and we have our networking gear,

135
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
our hardware and all of that

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,350
and we have a lot of visibility,

137
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,880
we can insert, you know network sensors

138
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,440
and things like that that
are going to let us know

139
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,273
what is happening.

140
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:52,860
They're gonna give us all that information

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,470
so we can paint that visibility picture

142
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,550
in a you know fairly good way.

143
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,570
When we start talking about private cloud,

144
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,570
we sort of got it because you know

145
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,370
it's kind of, we leveraging
on-prem type technologies

146
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,640
and we're bringing some cloud elements in

147
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,250
so we sort of got it okay.

148
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,420
When we talk about the public cloud

149
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,990
now this is where a little
bit of a fear comes in

150
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,880
some people don't fully understand it

151
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,563
we're gonna talk more about that.

152
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,240
It's hard managing one provider
from a security perspective

153
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm putting controls and
gaining that visibility

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,050
but when you talk about
multi-cloud now you're you know,

155
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,710
bubbling the issue or tripling that issue

156
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,270
because you have other providers

157
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,390
and if there's one thing
that we know is that

158
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,870
two providers don't do the
same thing in the same way.

159
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,723
So now you have to understand
how each one of those you know

160
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,220
is going to address certain things.

161
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,490
So definitely, definitely

162
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,410
the problem keeps getting a
little bit more complicated

163
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,950
as we go through all those models.

164
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,880
Now, the challenges that we have out there

165
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,770
everything is changing super, super fast.

166
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,609
Things happen in the blink
of an eye in the cloud

167
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,670
and we have to account
for all of those things.

168
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,304
For example, if you are doing
automatic scaling operations

169
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:17,280
to bring up more resources
in your peak times for,

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,289
you know we have, you
know a product launch

171
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,380
or something went viral online

172
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,490
and everybody's hitting your resources.

173
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,960
You know, those assets
that are gonna come up

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,430
additional computing
power or whatever it is,

175
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,220
databases, you name it

176
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,520
they are gonna be living there

177
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,349
and potentially for short,
tiny period of time.

178
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,910
So you have to account for that

179
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,940
from a visibility perspective.

180
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,780
Also the data now moves in
completely different ways

181
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,342
before we have the old
monolithic application.

182
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,070
Now we have a whole bunch
of tiny micro services

183
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,170
that are gonna be sending
your data back and forth.

184
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,150
There's gonna be some added complexity

185
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,060
kind of what you see here
in the diagram you know,

186
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,570
there's a lot of components
and different places

187
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,599
where your data will move
and you have to make sure

188
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,010
that you are protecting
data and understanding,

189
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,900
getting that visibility
what's happening at each step

190
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,169
because there's something it's, you know

191
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,740
there's an issue somewhere

192
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,530
you must understand what's going on.

193
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,270
The other big problem that
we have expertise gaps.

194
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,840
In a lot of cases, you know

195
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,763
you saw the survey results you know,

196
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,119
there's a big gap between
what's needed to design,

197
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,470
operate and maintain all of the solutions

198
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,039
and what your people know

199
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,429
so we have to make sure
that we address that.

200
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,979
As a result of all of
this what's happening is

201
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,150
that for some you out there,

202
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,410
you may not have an idea

203
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,923
what's going on in your cloud platforms.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,700
That could be a problem if
we don't understand that.

205
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,610
We're not gonna be able to track events

206
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,640
and see what's going on out there.

207
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,620
We will not have an
understanding of the issues

208
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,620
that are gonna come security
problems and things like that.

209
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,360
Even worse we will not be able

210
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,850
to identify potential threats.

211
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,080
And at the end of the day,

212
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,150
what we do as security
professionals is dealing with risk

213
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,959
and we're not gonna be able to identify

214
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,450
and communicate risk appropriately.

215
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,770
So that's a serious problem

216
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,340
and we need to take some action

217
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,720
to make sure that we
communicate that risk.

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,420
The question then becomes okay,

219
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,910
so what are we gonna do now?

220
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,829
How do we proceed?

221
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,130
How do we gain that visibility?

222
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,410
That is what we need to understand.

223
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,740
And it's a multi-part equation,

224
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,880
we're gonna attack it from
a lot of different angles

225
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,830
but here's kind of the proposal

226
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,920
that I have for you, you know.

227
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,900
We have to understand what
cloud assets we have out there.

228
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,060
This is nothing new

229
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,469
we've been talking about
managing your assets

230
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,300
forever in security, in IT,

231
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,729
all that you have to know what you have

232
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,360
if you want to protect it.

233
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,940
We also have to understand
what are some of the attacks

234
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,480
that are specific to cloud out there,

235
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,830
because now the threat landscape

236
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,210
is gonna be a little bit different

237
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,927
than when we were talking on
premise and things like that

238
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,520
sure, some things will translate,

239
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,010
but some of them are going
to be very particular.

240
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,220
Also we have to design that visibility,

241
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,413
excuse me strategy.

242
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,660
We have to understand that we
can not just turn things on

243
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,219
and expect all our problems to be solved.

244
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,610
We should have a plan
we'll talk more about that.

245
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,030
We also talk about tooling.

246
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,280
We'll see a lot of several
tools here at cloud native

247
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,740
and we'll talk about third party tools

248
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,730
and things like that,

249
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,420
how everything fits into that equation.

250
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,380
Also we gotta make sure that
we're leveraging automation

251
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,970
and last but not least skills development.

252
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,080
We, you know I'm a big believer

253
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,540
in people, process and technology

254
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,719
we can not leave the people out of this

255
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,293
so we have to make sure
that we address that also.

256
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,340
From going more in depth into
each of these cloud assets

257
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,310
you know if you follow the
Center for Internet Security

258
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,310
they're critical security controls

259
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,329
they always say top controls are hardware,

260
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,130
inventory and software inventory.

261
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,150
Now I'm using hardware
loosely here in the cloud

262
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,230
because of course there's
nothing for us to touch

263
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,130
but think about hardware in the cloud

264
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,583
as your computing assets,

265
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,460
easy to machines if you're talking AWS,

266
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,360
VMs if you're talking Azure,

267
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,640
if you're talking about things
like, you know serverless,

268
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,530
your functions, all of that
now becomes computing power.

269
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,819
So it's kind of the
equivalent of an asset.

270
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,373
So you have to understand what that is,

271
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:51,820
what you have, because again

272
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,600
you can not protect the
things that you have,

273
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,433
you don't know that

274
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,950
your risk is gonna go through the roof.

275
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,380
So that's gonna be a number one.

276
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,920
We also have to use
configuration management tools.

277
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,550
Having, knowing I'm sorry.

278
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,040
Knowing the assets that
we have that's okay,

279
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,550
but we must always ensure
that they are configured

280
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,640
in whatever desired
state we have determined.

281
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,660
Same thing that apply some prem

282
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,829
we're gonna have that on the cloud too.

283
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,710
So we have to make sure that
nothing is being tampered,

284
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,580
that there's no unauthorized changes

285
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,187
or if there's an attempt
or something like that,

286
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,550
we should be able to detect that

287
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,109
and we'll see how we're gonna do that

288
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,100
coming up in a little bit.

289
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,290
Attacks, we have to understand

290
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,050
what is it that the bad
guys are doing out there?

291
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,370
How are they trying to compromise us?

292
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,727
The adversary tactics like I said

293
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,209
are gonna be a little bit
different in the cloud.

294
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,440
You have to understand specific things

295
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,443
like the MITRE ATT&CK Framework,

296
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,959
they added cloud components late last year

297
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,930
so go ahead and look into that

298
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,130
that's gonna give you
some very specific ideas

299
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,620
of actual compromises

300
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,300
and how attackers have
penetrated cloud systems.

301
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,130
The Cloud Security Alliance,

302
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,050
they also put in a lot
of guidance out there

303
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,630
with the top cloud
threats and all of that.

304
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,283
So you can understand exactly what is it

305
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,460
that we're talking about.

306
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,600
After you understand all of that

307
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,160
now we can start talking about

308
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,900
how are we going to plan
for security use cases?

309
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,819
Now we can do a little
bit of threat modeling

310
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,070
and things like that.

311
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,610
Understand what are the specific issues

312
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,140
that we should be considering

313
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,910
when we're talking about
security in the cloud?

314
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,790
From there, we can move on later on

315
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,280
to more advanced things
like threat hunting,

316
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,209
we can automate some things

317
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,110
if we know something is not happening

318
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,830
or we should not be allowing it.

319
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,990
Well those things should be remediated

320
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,280
as close as real time as you can.

321
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,350
Remember that in the cloud

322
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,820
we can not be doing things manually

323
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,230
it just doesn't scale

324
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,440
again, it's gonna move just way too fast

325
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,400
we have to identify what we don't want

326
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,689
and we have to automate how
we can handle those things.

327
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,660
And of course, like everything
you have to continuously test

328
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,310
and refine all of this
stuff because otherwise

329
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,600
it's just gonna become stale.

330
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,830
From there, we have to
talk about the strategy.

331
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,360
Remember, don't walk
into this without a plan.

332
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,230
If you're in the early stages,

333
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,170
sit down and think about this.

334
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,560
So the question becomes,

335
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,739
what are we gonna be looking at?

336
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,060
Well, think about all those
assets that I just mentioned

337
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,969
network components,
databases, virtual machines,

338
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,750
serverless components containers.

339
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,763
And here's why this is important.

340
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,870
If we're talking about monitoring your VMs

341
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,660
that's fairly easy,

342
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,290
you can do that easy in the cloud.

343
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,360
It's really no different a VM

344
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,910
in the cloud that it's on prem.

345
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,760
Otherwise other than the fact that

346
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,780
you don't control the
hypervisor but that's about it.

347
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,470
But when we talk about
some more advanced things

348
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,940
like serverless and containers

349
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,640
now this is a little bit different

350
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,280
you may gonna have to leverage
some third party tooling.

351
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,310
And again, we'll talk more about that,

352
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,540
but this is gonna help
answer the questions,

353
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,920
what do we look at?

354
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,459
After you know what you have

355
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,620
and what do you need
to consider from here?

356
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,610
Again, this is just a starting point

357
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,380
then you can start
answering some questions of,

358
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,010
okay, what are we gonna do here with this?

359
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,400
What are we gonna do with that?

360
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,550
But always make sure that
you understand what you have

361
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,000
and what are the things that you have

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,890
to put your eyes on.

363
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,160
After that then you
can start to talk about

364
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,040
one of the key things that we
need to do centralized logging

365
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,780
because all of those things

366
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,410
that we talked about
in the previous slide,

367
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,959
generally logs network
activity, serverless functions,

368
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,080
VMs, you name it everything has a log,

369
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,240
but it's fairly trivial dumping those to

370
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,730
some sort of central
storage like a bucket.

371
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,970
But that doesn't really mean

372
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,630
it's gonna be actionable for you

373
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,550
that is where the
tooling is gonna go ahead

374
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,479
and come in and play an important role.

375
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,860
You should be doing
something like centralizing,

376
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,760
correlating, analyzing all those logs.

377
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,350
You know, here we just
have an example of a,

378
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,763
you know Splunk super widely used,

379
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,439
but you may have ELK or
some third-party product

380
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,690
cloud-native seem some
something like that,

381
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,870
whatever your solution is

382
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,940
it's gonna make your life easier

383
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,100
when you have all that data centralized

384
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,190
and you don't have to be hunting for logs

385
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,820
and looking for things everywhere.

386
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,423
So lots of value right there.

387
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,260
Now, when we talk about
the tools always start,

388
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,750
of course looking first

389
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,090
at what the cloud service
provider is giving you.

390
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,070
And this is why this is
important because first,

391
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,210
those tools you just click a
button and you turn them on

392
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,750
they're gonna be super easy to leverage.

393
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,530
And the other thing
that we'll see out there

394
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,730
is that they interact

395
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,610
with the other native
services, fairly smooth.

396
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,153
So it's very easy to turn
something on and you know,

397
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:52,830
it's gonna pop to your systems.

398
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,420
Also, we just mentioned

399
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,380
centralizing, correlate and visualizing.

400
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,689
The providers may have some
tools in that space sure

401
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,783
but understand that they're
going to be some limitations.

402
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,829
If you come from a super mature

403
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,109
on-premise security environment

404
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,367
you're gonna see now
that the patterns here

405
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,166
are gonna be a little bit different.

406
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,089
The cloud-native tooling
might not be enough for you,

407
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,579
and this is a question that
you're going to have to answer

408
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,909
but you know, always
consider what they have.

409
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,450
For some example here we have

410
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,040
CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Security Hub

411
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,620
we'll talk about those more in detail.

412
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,840
Azure has sent an alum some other tools

413
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,530
and Google GCP they also have
their Security Command Center

414
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,649
so everybody's doing
something in security.

415
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,990
Part of the message here is

416
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,000
consider what each provider has given you,

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,590
it's not gonna be the same
offerings across providers

418
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,490
some of them are gonna be more
mature in the security space,

419
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,250
other ones may not, solutions may vary,

420
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,310
your mileage may vary.

421
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,020
So make sure that at least

422
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,110
you know you're understanding

423
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,649
what the service provider is giving you.

424
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,410
And then from there, you
can go ahead and evaluate

425
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,383
what's gonna be your you
know, your next need.

426
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,780
To take a look in a little bit more detail

427
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,000
into some of the cloud
provider specific tools,

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,720
I wanted to give you an idea here

429
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,290
with a practical example

430
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,720
of what sort of visibility we gain

431
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,260
with a tool like CloudWatch.

432
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,990
So like I mentioned, if
you live in the AWS world,

433
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,823
you might be

434
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,470
you know that you can throw
your logs into a bucket

435
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,100
and they're gonna live
there and that's fine.

436
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,629
But again the other
part of that question is

437
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,010
what do we do with those?

438
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,510
How do we action them?

439
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,520
So tools like CloudWatch

440
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,160
are gonna help answer that question,

441
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
they're gonna let us see what's happening.

442
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,610
For example, if you know
here in this example

443
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,149
that the key creation is
something that is rare

444
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,590
and it should only be limited

445
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,129
to some people in your environment

446
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,520
well, you can go ahead
and create some filters

447
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,050
to look for that activity.

448
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,330
As you can see in this example,

449
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,860
we're saying show me, you know,

450
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,340
create access key events.

451
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,399
From there you can go ahead
and take a look in depth

452
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,170
at some of the activity.

453
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,680
Here I've highlighted a
few fields of interest

454
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,590
and the first one says, you know,

455
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,550
somebody created a key we see
the event name right there,

456
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,409
the username is evil person.

457
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,150
And I know I'm making it a
little bit obvious but you know,

458
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,250
hopefully you get the idea to illustrate

459
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,550
what you should be looking at.

460
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,020
So now you start seeing how

461
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,800
you can make those logs actionable

462
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,909
and you see the keys
that the person created

463
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,110
and you start to paint a better picture

464
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,719
of what's going on.

465
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,040
From there then you can go ahead and say,

466
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,070
okay show me all the activity

467
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,520
that this evil person
user has been performing.

468
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,910
So that's what we're doing here.

469
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,270
We're changing our filter
and selecting some fields

470
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,050
and here now we have basically a trail

471
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,323
of what this person did

472
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,810
person login through the console,
they change your password,

473
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,740
created a security
group, created a bucket,

474
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,400
authorize-security-group-egress.

475
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,130
So if this speaks to you

476
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,100
you understand that
this seems awful weird.

477
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,003
Definitely somebody here is up to no good.

478
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,149
Now see how from having
all the logs in one place

479
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,750
now we just get the picture
a little bit better.

480
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,970
So again, we're gaining
on that visibility,

481
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,820
we're understanding what's happening here.

482
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,889
So lots of value right there.

483
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,380
Another tool that we can
leverage in the Amazon world,

484
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,650
it's gonna be Security Hub

485
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,340
and this tool is gonna
give you a security score.

486
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,020
So it's gonna go ahead and compare

487
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,991
how your environment is set up

488
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,530
against a set of best practices.

489
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,830
Here we're using the CIS benchmark

490
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,240
and we're also using the
AWS foundational practices,

491
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
security best practices.

492
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,040
So when you dig into that
what you can see is that

493
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,490
you see what needs action,

494
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,563
what is going on here that
I need to pay attention to.

495
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,430
Here is saying that we
have something critical,

496
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,630
is saying listen,

497
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,000
your root account does not
have multifactor enable.

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,170
So that's bad first of all,

499
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,200
hopefully that's not you,
that's you go fix it.

500
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,550
But the issue here is that

501
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,450
we're seeing that we have a critical issue

502
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,470
that if we did not enable tools like this,

503
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,060
we would be basically blind

504
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,963
to the fact that this was going on.

505
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,050
This would have been exposed
to whoever set up the account,

506
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,070
but did that person forget that?

507
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,513
Now the tool here's gonna give us

508
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,439
that visibility to understand

509
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,040
that somebody did something
wrong or forgot something

510
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,840
and we need to go ahead and fix it.

511
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,889
So what we're seeing here is
that we have different tools

512
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,800
that are adding a little bit of value

513
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,040
and again, we getting that equation of

514
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,280
how are we gonna gain visibility?

515
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,580
Every tool is gonna do
a little bit to help us

516
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,490
go towards that state where
we have the visibility

517
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,740
that we are expecting.

518
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,940
Another one of those tools,

519
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,980
that's gonna be very helpful for us

520
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,034
it's gonna be GuardDuty.

521
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:15,970
GuardDuty it's kind of a
machine learning application

522
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,373
you know, service if you're new to it.

523
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,330
What it does it's gonna
collect in the background

524
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,260
a lot of your logs, network activity, DNS

525
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,420
and other other logs

526
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,790
and it's not really
exposing the logs to you.

527
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,750
What it's doing is
detecting suspicious things.

528
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,360
Over time this tool can learn

529
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,087
like your use patterns
and things like that

530
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:40,830
and if there's some sort of anomaly

531
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,639
it can go ahead and alert you.

532
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,180
Example that we have
marked here at the top,

533
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,893
somebody is trying to brute force via SSH.

534
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,219
You know, one of your easy two machines

535
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,550
that is exposed out to the internet

536
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,419
and that might be of concern to you.

537
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,010
So you may wanna do something about that.

538
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,520
If we keep going down that list

539
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,613
we're gonna see other
things that look suspicious

540
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:07,420
like port scans, more brute force attacks.

541
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,610
And if we look all the way at the bottom

542
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,060
we even have more details
on route credential usage.

543
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,530
Remember that part of what we
need to do here in security,

544
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,480
we have to protect you
know, the crown jewels.

545
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,350
For us the root account in AWS
or whatever your provider is

546
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,469
that master account

547
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,170
it's gonna be one of those crown jewels.

548
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,030
You wanna make sure that

549
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,750
that's not used on an everyday basis.

550
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,780
If you have it, you know fairly secured

551
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,570
and you see activity
with that root account

552
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,770
there's something weird there.

553
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,440
So now again, more visibility

554
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,685
things that are strange you know,

555
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,950
and these are happening for a reason

556
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,650
from here you can go ahead

557
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,710
and you see the option
suppress the finding

558
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,870
if that's an activity that you deem sure,

559
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,439
okay, we can live with this

560
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,410
but at least it's gonna give
your analyst and responders

561
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,970
an idea what to look at
and what kind of activity

562
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,583
is going on another great tool of value.

563
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,320
From there we also moved to
another one called AWS Config

564
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,330
and this goes back to what I mentioned.

565
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,689
You have to manage your inventory,

566
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,510
you have to make sure
that that desire state

567
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,660
is enforced at all times

568
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,220
and that you get alerts
on any deviations okay.

569
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,790
If we don't have this set of tools,

570
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,250
we may not see that.

571
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,870
What we have here is telling us

572
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,409
that we have a number of resources

573
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,717
that are not compliant with
the rules that we said,

574
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,690
and we're talking about rules like,

575
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,143
buckets should not be exposed publicly.

576
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,680
Buckets should be accessed
over SSL things like that.

577
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,880
There's a you know, a whole
bunch of default rules

578
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,650
you can set your custom rules.

579
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,470
So that's gonna be part of that

580
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,290
continuous monitoring aspect.

581
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,649
These tools always gonna be
running looking at things

582
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,660
that may look a little bit weird

583
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,580
based on the rules that you have said

584
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,990
and you've said my system
should be in this state

585
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,570
and yeah, it's gonna let you know

586
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,929
when something deviates from that.

587
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,650
Quick example here to bring it back

588
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,030
to our example of the evil person

589
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,899
that we talked about a minute ago.

590
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,910
What we see here in our Config is that

591
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,230
we have a security group that

592
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,000
yeah was created on the 27th of October

593
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,900
and you see what it's happening with that.

594
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,350
It's letting you know that

595
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,550
two configuration events
happened on that day

596
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,250
that it was created first
and then it was modified

597
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,190
to allow some network traffic in.

598
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,720
So now you see the body
of those tools like this.

599
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,780
You can go back and look at a timeline

600
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,420
and see what changes
happened, when and who did it.

601
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,670
So a lot, a lot of value.

602
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,310
If you want to know more about the event,

603
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,409
you can click on that cloud trail option

604
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,210
and it's gonna show you the full log.

605
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,620
But at least this is more
actionable than you know,

606
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,239
going through a very verbose
log and sifting through it

607
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
and then figure out what happened.

608
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,150
This is kind of the things that

609
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,010
first responders, incident
responders may need

610
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,320
to go ahead and at least get a quick idea

611
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,153
of what's happening.

612
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,730
Of course you can go and
follow the breadcrumbs later on

613
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,920
but this is gonna give
you that high-level idea

614
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,623
of what is the bad activity.

615
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,690
Also, we have AWS Macie,

616
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,970
it's kind of data loss
prevention equivalent.

617
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,780
This tool was recently revamped.

618
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,723
So it has a little bit more functionality.

619
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,280
Here what we see is that,

620
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,840
you know, you can see at a glance,

621
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,993
do I have anything publicly exposed?

622
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,980
Do I have stuff un-encrypted?

623
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,760
I'm I sharing some stuff?

624
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,700
And those are things you know,

625
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,330
if you do not have
publicly accessible buckets

626
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,023
and you see something here yeah,

627
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:53,580
that's something that's concerning

628
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,810
and you should be looking at.

629
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,050
So it's gonna be a good tool
if you have a lot of documents

630
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,840
that you need to analyze this
is gonna be helpful for that.

631
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,340
Taking a little bit of
another look into this,

632
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,169
here we see that on the lower section,

633
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,620
we have custom data identifiers.

634
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,719
So what we're saying here is

635
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,010
we can define what we're
looking for in those documents.

636
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,720
For example, if you classify your data

637
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,440
and you have public, sensitive,

638
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,030
I don't know, confidential or
secret or something like that,

639
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,840
you can go ahead and set rules

640
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,850
that look for that information.

641
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,070
So let's say you have a public bucket

642
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,919
where you put your press
releases and things like that.

643
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,520
Well, you should be looking for
confidential things in there

644
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,570
because they do not belong in that bucket.

645
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,689
That will be kind of an example
of what we're seeing here.

646
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,740
Here we're seeing that

647
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,120
there was a hint of the word confidential

648
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,040
on that file that is highlighted there

649
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,060
and yeah, this is the bucket that

650
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,860
you would not expect
confidential information.

651
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,862
So that would allow you
again to gain that visibility

652
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:02,130
into things that could be going on

653
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,060
that maybe you would never
know in some other way.

654
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,190
So hopefully you see again,

655
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,760
how each one of those tools,

656
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,610
it's kind of helping paint
a big picture of visibility

657
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,600
and how we can understand what's happening

658
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,310
in our cloud environment.

659
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,520
But with that we have to
be mindful of the gap here.

660
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,520
You know, those are cloud
service provider, native tools

661
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,270
they're not going to be unicorns.

662
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,160
You know, they're not this
magical thing that will resolve

663
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,373
all of your visibility problems
and everything is good.

664
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
No, we established that early on

665
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,960
we said you may need third party tools.

666
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,920
Some of these tools are gonna be expensive

667
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,780
then you have to meer the exercise.

668
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,250
is it worth bringing a third party tool

669
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,370
if it's gonna cost me the same

670
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,850
and I gain more functionality?

671
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,429
You know, it's a question
that you have to ask.

672
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,950
You have to go through that exercise,

673
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,460
you have to understand what
every tool is providing you

674
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,240
and what gaps they're going to leave

675
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,850
and based on your risk appetite,

676
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,360
you can say sure, I can
live with this or no.

677
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,750
I need some, you know
I need something else

678
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,550
that's gonna work better for me

679
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,740
and that's when you're gonna
have to move to third parties.

680
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,870
So what I'm saying here is that

681
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,709
the third parties will bring
you know a lot of value.

682
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,820
Just the same way that the CSP tools will.

683
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,040
For third parties the good
thing in some instances is

684
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,020
that you know them already.

685
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,180
So you might be able to

686
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,700
if your licensing has some mobility clause

687
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,800
or something like that, you might be able

688
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,090
if you're migrating from on-prem to cloud,

689
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,970
you might be able to
those licenses with you

690
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,080
there might not be an additional cost

691
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,990
that's something that's gonna
be a factor to consider.

692
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,410
Also, we talked about the
challenge of visibility

693
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,400
for serverless operations and containers,

694
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,080
Kubernetes, Dockers,
the Docker containers,

695
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,169
you name it all of that stuff.

696
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,340
Some of these providers
here, they're gonna have

697
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,350
very specialized tools

698
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,209
that are going to allow you
to gain way deeper visibility

699
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,680
than anything that any
native provider can have.

700
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,410
So if you move in those spaces

701
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,470
it's something for sure

702
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,010
that you're gonna have to look at.

703
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,850
They are going to help you all these tools

704
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,939
to cover those gaps that
the providers might be

705
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,740
you know leaving out.

706
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,740
So again it's an exercise for
all us to kind of do the math

707
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,092
I like to call it and
evaluate and see you know,

708
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,160
what do we have and what are we gonna need

709
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,713
after we apply the basic
controls that we can?

710
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,323
From there and we move on
to talk about automation.

711
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,810
We have to do this again.

712
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,639
It doesn't scale to do
things manually on the cloud.

713
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,550
You're gonna have to
think about things like

714
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,870
cloud security posture management tools

715
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,649
more of those tools that are looking

716
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,900
at a high level at your
environment and saying

717
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,260
okay, this is everything that
we are supposed to be doing,

718
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,680
we're doing based on whatever you said.

719
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,370
So those tools are gonna
give you a lot of value,

720
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,750
especially as your cloud environments grow

721
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,200
you kind of get the
single pane of glass view

722
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,810
that's gonna be of value for sure.

723
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,367
Also with automation you know

724
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,070
you'll continuously assessing your cloud,

725
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,909
you don't have to kick anything off

726
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,120
it will be doing that all the time.

727
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,419
Remediation also, you
could do that automatically

728
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,920
that's the other thing if you know,

729
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,120
bucket should not be publicly exposed,

730
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,100
if somebody does that

731
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,969
you can revert that action via automation.

732
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,700
Also, these tools are
gonna give you visibility

733
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,240
to multiple environments.

734
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,130
If you're one of those
that lives in multi-cloud,

735
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,890
this is gonna make a lot of sense

736
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,030
because doing in-house a lot of mapping

737
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,980
of how one provider does one thing

738
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,010
and how the other provider
does it that is really hard.

739
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,810
So tools that move in
multi-cloud environment

740
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,210
will bring you a lot of value.

741
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,340
Also, we're gonna be able to
detect in this configuration.

742
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,173
Remember that we said

743
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:04,470
that most of the breaches
that we're seeing

744
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,990
is because somebody clicked on
something and made a mistake,

745
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,500
made that bucket public,

746
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,220
left some administrative
interface exposed in some tools

747
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,780
or something like that

748
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,760
and at the end of the day you know,

749
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,150
with all of this stuff

750
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,130
we've gotta to be able
to identify and remediate

751
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,770
all the risks that activity
you know is gonna bring to us.

752
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,830
So definitely consider, you
know how much you're automating

753
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,080
and always be asking yourself

754
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,490
how we can get better by doing automation.

755
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,880
Don't get me wrong but doesn't
mean automate all the things

756
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,030
because at some point

757
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,280
some things will need human interaction,

758
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,060
but like I said those low hanging fruit,

759
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,000
the things that you absolutely know

760
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,530
that should not be happening,

761
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,980
you should be auto
remediating all of that stuff.

762
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,170
Skills to wrap it up here,
skills are important.

763
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,083
We have to train our people.

764
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,870
I always try to like I said

765
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,439
frame everything from process,
people and technology.

766
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,970
So I always sneaking the
skill slide every time I talk

767
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,540
because I talk to people out there

768
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,540
and it's not happening to the
extent that I wish you know,

769
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:14,657
when I talked to my peers
in the field they say

770
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:16,817
"No, I'm just learning
new things by myself.

771
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:19,020
"Oh, I gained no training
or something like that."

772
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,200
We have to make sure that
we're training our people,

773
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,380
we have to make sure
that we're going hands on

774
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,600
because of all of these
tools in the theory,

775
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,639
they look fancy, you
read the documentation

776
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,957
and you may think you got it.

777
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:32,580
But we have to test it,

778
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,460
we have to make sure we understand

779
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,020
how the tools are going
to interact with things,

780
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,825
how are they gonna alert us?

781
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,260
Are we're gonna get like
thousands of false positives?

782
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,070
We have to do that.

783
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,710
Also from the skills perspective

784
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,920
throw some challenges to yourself.

785
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,020
If you're an engineer
or if you're a leader,

786
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,360
throw it out to your people.

787
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,097
It's like, "Hey, how would
you do this in the cloud?

788
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,447
"Or what if X or Y or Z
happened in the cloud?

789
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,419
"How would we respond to that?"

790
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,840
So you can do something like game days

791
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,340
you know, tabletop
exercises but more hands-on.

792
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,996
And you can do that in the cloud

793
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:08,530
that's gonna be helpful, it's
gonna bring a lot of value.

794
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,500
So couple of ideas, you
know to get you going

795
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,100
never forget about you know,
closing that skills gap

796
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,723
that everybody in
cybersecurity talks about.

797
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,920
So to conclude and bring it back home

798
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,469
kind of recapping what
we talked about today.

799
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,709
You know, no secret,

800
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,870
it's gonna be challenging

801
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,270
gaining a level of visibility
for security operations

802
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,620
that we are gonna be comfortable with.

803
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,270
So it's gonna take some time,

804
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,850
it's gonna take some effort.

805
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,210
Planning a strategy is gonna
be a key thing for that.

806
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,870
Remember that we can have logs,

807
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,850
but we have to make them actionable,

808
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,290
we have to centralize,
visualize, correlate

809
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,779
and that's gonna require some tooling.

810
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,880
CSP tools are gonna help us

811
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,503
they may leave some gaps may or may not

812
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:52,449
depends on your use case.

813
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,339
We may need to bring a third-party tools

814
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,630
and that's gonna go ahead and yeah,

815
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,610
help us what we're
trying to do reduce risk.

816
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,680
Finally, please do not
forget to train your people

817
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,730
because the cloud is
something fantastic, exciting

818
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,780
again, it's enabling businesses to move

819
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,540
at a really fast speed, very efficient

820
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,529
but only when we do all the
things that we saw here today

821
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,120
that's when we are going
to answer that question,

822
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,910
how can we reduce risk by
gaining visibility in the cloud?

823
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,980
So with that I want to thank everybody,

824
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,710
continue with the conversation

825
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,980
and I'm gonna meet in
the networking lounge,

826
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,100
open for any questions.

827
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,049
Also later on, feel free
to hit me on social media.

828
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,570
I'll be more than happy to
answer any questions that I have.

829
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,280
So again, keep the conversation going.

830
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,680
Thank you for stopping
by in this session today.
