to Michee Smith for the presentation.

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,220
- Hello, I'm Michee Smith.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,769
I've been the Product Manager

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,040
in the Data Protection and Privacy Team

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,810
at Google for the last five years.

22
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,400
I work in Google Cloud

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
and I lead a team of product managers,

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,250
focused on all types of issues related

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,250
to data sovereignty, access,
insider risk in Google Cloud.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,270
And I am so excited to be here,

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,030
to talk to you about one of the topics

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,390
I'm very passionate
about, which is privacy.

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,350
Now, when I think about privacy,

30
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,280
specifically on the business side,

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,840
'cause I've also looked at
privacy on the consumer side,

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,760
there's kind of three major
categories that come up.

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,360
Being that I started with
privacy on the consumer side

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,300
when I first started to look at privacy

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,840
from a business perspective,

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,530
I thought that it would be a lot of issues

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,270
around compliance and user privacy,

38
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,429
which we see here.

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,520
But actually, the main
thing that customers want

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,399
to talk about was really about
data access and sovereignty.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,850
The questions that I would get,

42
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,210
as you can see for an example here,

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,149
really trying to get to the heart of,

44
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,193
will my data remain
confidential in your platform?

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,240
And that's why you see questions here,

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,610
like customer managed encryption keys.

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,530
If I have a service that use
it and I transferred my data

48
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,980
to a service that doesn't support it,

49
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,920
does my data become decrypted?

50
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,980
Does someone has access to it?

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,763
And will that data be able to
be given to the US government?

52
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,339
So, that's one of the first things,

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,940
first framings that came up quite often.

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,950
The second framing that
came up is one of the ones

55
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,450
I was expecting, which is
adherence to local regulations

56
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,640
and certain compliance
frameworks, which in general,

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,790
which is not specific to privacy,

58
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,429
really is a table stake
for any corporation

59
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,280
that you meet certain regulations

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,120
and that you comply with
certain compliance frameworks.

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
And so, when it comes to
privacy laws and standards,

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,140
there's no difference,
they're table stake standards

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,429
and legislation that
they have to adhere to.

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,710
And then finally when it
comes to user privacy,

65
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,210
this is the area that really aligned

66
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,380
with what I was doing
on the consumer privacy,

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,100
where you start to come
up with issues such as,

68
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,609
notice and consent.

69
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,880
Really about data
collection and the purpose

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,857
for which you're gonna use that data.

71
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:02,320
And for business customers
it's really around

72
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,180
does the cloud provider has
access to my end-user data,

73
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,840
and if they do, how do they use it?

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,540
What about my employee data, right?

75
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,920
Because employees are individuals as well.

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,100
There are people that there's
personal data about them.

77
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,079
How will that data be used?

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
So those are the three main
things that would come up

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,700
as we would talk to customers.

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,040
And now I wanna talk a little bit

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,393
about the challenges associated with each

82
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:28,960
of those frameworks.

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,240
So, when it comes to data
access and sovereignty,

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,380
it's really about visibility
into the operations

85
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,410
of the cloud provider. Right?

86
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,799
When you think about
it, if you are a CISO,

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,060
a Chief Information Security
Officer at a corporation,

88
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,090
you know what security
operations you have in place,

89
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,800
you know what you've set up
and you know what you've done

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,570
to protect data from unauthorized use.

91
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,620
When you move to a cloud provider,

92
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,860
you're wondering, do they have
the same physical securities

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,130
that I will have in my data center

94
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,660
or my on-premise data center?

95
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,410
Do they have the same operations in place?

96
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,329
Do they require similar
types of authorizations

97
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,550
before a support personnel or
an engineer can access data.

98
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,940
Right? And so that's one
challenge that comes up.

99
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,387
The other thing is,
since I have that control

100
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,399
over my employees when they access data,

101
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,299
what does the cloud provider put in place?

102
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,530
Is there some type of
multi-party authorization

103
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,989
or can the customer support
person just access the data?

104
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,500
And if they wanna access the data,

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,640
do they have to ask me
before they access it

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,060
or if they just have a ticket,
can they just go and do it?

107
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,050
And similar with engineers
if they're troubleshooting

108
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,810
an outage, do they have to come to me

109
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,400
before they access my data?

110
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,979
Or do they have permission
to just go and do it?

111
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,140
A lot of questions come up around that.

112
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,890
And then final questions
came up really was around,

113
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,820
especially outside the US,

114
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,690
was around the surveillance
posture of the country

115
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,010
that the cloud provider operates in.

116
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,539
In my case because I'm with Google,

117
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,010
we operate in the United States.

118
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,980
And so there's a lot of questions about

119
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,440
how do we provide data from my customers

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,303
to the US in the case of
some type of legal requests?

121
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,240
And that's really what
you see on the right side.

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,750
That first tier of sovereignty

123
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,290
called data sovereignty.

124
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,340
And data sovereignty is
really about data access.

125
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,859
And if you see, there's a whole spectrum

126
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,980
when it comes to the larger
question around sovereignty,

127
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,660
where while data sovereignty
focuses specifically

128
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,010
on access to data,

129
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,099
you start to go into
operational sovereignty,

130
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,180
which starts to look at,

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,810
Who can access the data, right?

132
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,610
And then you start to go
into software sovereignty,

133
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,770
which is really about how do I ensure

134
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,599
that if I couldn't get any
updates from my cloud provider,

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,650
that I know I can survive and my workloads

136
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,000
can continue to run.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,860
So, there's a big range
around data sovereignty,

138
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,610
or digital sovereignty and
data sovereignty comes up

139
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,163
a lot in the context of privacy.

140
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,700
I mentioned before, privacy compliance,

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,930
some of the challenges
they're really aligned

142
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,300
with the proliferation of
different compliance frameworks.

143
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,449
And as I'm looking here, I've named a few

144
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,290
in my kind of word puzzle
there on the right.

145
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,480
And as I'm looking at it now,

146
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,390
I see that I've already left
out one of the newer ones,

147
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,800
the ISO 27701 standards,

148
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,240
which tries to certify cloud
providers as a controller

149
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,190
versus a processor, which is a terminology

150
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,600
that was made pretty popular when GDPR

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,270
was signed into law back in 2018.

152
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,890
But you can tell customers
are really struggling

153
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,690
with how do I, if I do CCPA,

154
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,490
does that conflict at all with GDPR?

155
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,183
And if I do ISO 27552 or ISO 27701,

156
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,520
will that just cover all of

157
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,260
these different privacy regulations

158
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,630
that I'm concerned about. Right?

159
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,120
And then in addition to that
from a compliance perspective,

160
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,520
how do I evidence on top of a cloud?

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,960
If you think about some of
these compliance standards,

162
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,109
a lot of them were created

163
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,810
and focused a lot on the
on-premise scenario, right?

164
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,500
Then didn't necessarily
take into consideration

165
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,440
the shared responsibility
between the cloud provider

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,560
and the customer.

167
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,970
And so, when you're trying to
evidence on top of the cloud,

168
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,370
we'll see a lot of people doing things

169
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,500
like taking screenshots of configurations,

170
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,250
which is maybe not the most
efficient way to do it,

171
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,000
but it's something that
gives them something

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,670
that's somewhat immutable
that has a specific point

173
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,220
in time that they can use to evidence.

174
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,980
So, these are some of the
challenges that I've seen

175
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,440
as I talk to our different
customers around privacy

176
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,433
in the cloud.

177
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,390
User privacy, which goes back

178
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,760
to that kind of consumer,

179
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,510
aligns a lot more with
that consumer privacy angle

180
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,960
really focuses on things
like consent and terms.

181
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,539
And so when you think about,
in the individual world

182
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,580
where you're going and
starting the app on your phone,

183
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,280
you may see a pop-up that says,

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,190
do you want to share your
location information? Right?

185
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,570
Now on the business side, you can imagine

186
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,140
that maybe Google or maybe
a cloud provider knows about

187
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,979
where the location is of your employee,

188
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,350
who's accessing their console. Right?

189
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,350
And so, questions come up about
how does my employee consent

190
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,680
to share that type of data with Google?

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,370
Is that part of the privacy
policy that Google provides?

192
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,690
Is that part of the terms of service

193
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,409
or the contract that we have? Right?

194
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,520
How does that happen? Right.

195
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,500
And so a lot of questions
come up around the terms.

196
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,030
The other question comes up
is related to a new trend

197
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,800
that I'll talk about later as well,

198
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,589
which is to give people recommendations

199
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,270
on how to use cloud more efficiently.

200
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,260
And this is typically based on metadata

201
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,580
that the cloud provider knows about you.

202
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,080
So, let's say for example, if you're using

203
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,000
an online storage solution
and you put a file

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,390
into that storage solution.

205
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,220
It's clear that that file is your data.

206
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,880
But if we know, let's say the
online cloud provider knows

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,500
that the size of that file
is two gigabytes, right?

208
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,950
And they need to know that
so that they can charge you.

209
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,150
The fact that they know that
the file is two gigabytes.

210
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,970
Is that your data? Is that their data?

211
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,180
And furthermore, can I then use that data

212
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,089
to run it through either
machine learning algorithms

213
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,070
or rule-based algorithms
to help you figure out

214
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,140
how to leverage our storage better

215
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,840
or to how to store it
more securely. Right?

216
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,150
So, all of these things
which can really help you,

217
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,230
still brings up questions around,

218
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,970
is this information about you?

219
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,240
Is this information that
you own or someone else's

220
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,900
or the cloud provider owns
and how can it be used? Right?

221
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Which are really core
principles around data privacy.

222
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,989
So, the market has evolved

223
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,210
to try to address these challenges.

224
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,120
And I would say from what I've observed,

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,870
and this is an area that when you join

226
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,150
the networking lounge later,
would love to discuss with you.

227
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,880
I see that a lot of the
current spin in the market

228
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,170
is really happening in this third column

229
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,760
that I have up here,
reporting and compliance.

230
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,380
And I think the reason
why that's happening,

231
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,070
it's really because a
lot of what customers

232
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,110
are hiring people for is consultation.

233
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,540
How, like I said before,
it's really difficult

234
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,150
to keep up with the
proliferation of frameworks

235
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,060
and rules and regulations
that are out there.

236
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,420
So, they're hiring consultants
to help them understand

237
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,219
how to interpret, how do
I change my technology

238
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,320
or my operations to now
align with these new laws

239
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,740
or these new standards?

240
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,410
How do I evidence on top
of it so that I can prove

241
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,050
to regulators and whoever else

242
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,270
that is like a third-party
auditor and to my customers

243
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,439
that I'm actually doing this correctly?

244
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,780
And then how do I prove
that my sub-processor

245
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,199
who is the cloud provider is
also doing things correctly?

246
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,510
And so, a lot of consultants
are being leveraged

247
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,750
and their proprietary
tools that comes along

248
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,900
with their services are being leveraged

249
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,270
to really address that issue

250
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,199
that customers are having right now.

251
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,793
Well we see a lot of
technology advances happening

252
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,470
in the first two columns.

253
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,370
So, if you take a look at the first one

254
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,490
with data governance, you'll
see that I've broken that out

255
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,120
into kind of three areas:

256
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,920
Data asset management,
automated classifiers

257
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,449
and finally policy enforcement

258
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,900
which is all brought
together to really create

259
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,850
a end-to-end data governance scenario.

260
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,570
And then the middle
column starts to focus on

261
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,850
how do I make sure that
I can get the most out

262
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,380
of the data while still preserving
the privacy of the data?

263
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,970
Making sure that identifiable information

264
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,850
in the data can't be released or given.

265
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,550
And so the next couple of
slides is gonna talk about

266
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,229
each of these areas and
how the market is trying

267
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,873
to help people in all three columns.

268
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,820
So, let's start with data governance.

269
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,270
And when you think about data governance,

270
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,103
so at least when I do,

271
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,689
I think about two primary personas

272
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,780
and that's like the
DevOps or the IT admins

273
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,240
who are setting up the
different environments

274
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,940
for which the workloads would run

275
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,950
as well as the risk
compliance officers who have

276
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,900
to evaluate that environment to make sure

277
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,000
that it complies with the rules

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,950
that have been set up, right?

279
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,650
And some of the things that we're seeing

280
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,500
is inventory systems.

281
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,870
I think almost every major
hyperscaler has some kind

282
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,120
of inventory system where
you can see all the resources

283
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,470
that you've created for
a particular project

284
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,720
or a particular organization. Right?

285
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,890
And people are leveraging
those inventory systems

286
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,480
to understand where is
data flowing in my system

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,170
and to create data maps.

288
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,069
They're leveraging it
to create data deletion

289
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,340
and data retention policies. Right?

290
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,240
So that's a big trend that I'm
starting to see in that area.

291
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,940
Definitely, auto-classification,

292
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,280
the ability to just scan data especially

293
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,510
at collection time, right?

294
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,920
That's probably one of the easiest time

295
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,810
to figure out what your data is.

296
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,050
What we're seeing a lot of
people use consultants for

297
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,170
is to actually go back and
scan their environments

298
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,002
'cause they're like,

299
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,830
I'm not sure what data is
in here, help me. Right?

300
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,250
And so, the more you can start to do

301
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,160
that data classification at the time

302
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,350
when you collect the data,
the easier it will make

303
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,690
for you later on.

304
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,070
And then another thing that's come up

305
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,170
is this a policy as code.

306
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,900
Policy as code is really interesting

307
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,630
because it basically
changes policy enforcement

308
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,150
into a change management problem,

309
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,310
which is something that many IT operators

310
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,890
and engineers are familiar with. Right?

311
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,770
Because we checking, they
checking source code all the time

312
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,010
and then new version checking

313
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,520
and they do pre-checks to make sure

314
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,170
that the code is right before it goes up

315
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,140
to production. Right?

316
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,540
And so, if you think about policy as code,

317
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,540
how can I codify my policy
similar to the way I do code

318
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,160
so that I could actually
preview the changes

319
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,020
that it will do to
production before it happens.

320
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,420
That I can make sure I understand

321
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,520
what the actual policies are.

322
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,050
And then I can do some type

323
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,140
of automated enforcement around it.

324
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,160
So those are the things that I'm seeing

325
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,053
in the data governance area.

326
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,650
When it comes to data protection,

327
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,370
obviously encryption is a big area.

328
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,200
A lot more happening around
not just encryption at rest

329
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,730
or in transit, but also,
with encryption in use.

330
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,720
So, with encryption at rest,

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,840
obviously key management, KMS.

332
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,740
We're seeing HSMs
scenarios and even recently

333
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,450
we're starting to see
scenarios where the customer

334
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,450
can completely keep the key
outside of the environment.

335
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,900
And the Key Management Service,

336
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,430
KMS knows how to interact
with that external key

337
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,000
and use it to encrypt the data.

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
The other thing that we're starting to see

339
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,410
with the kind of rise of
confidential computing

340
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,930
is that you can now have
data encrypted in memory,

341
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,120
which also starts to address

342
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,850
a significant insider risk
concern that some customers have.

343
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,283
So that's one great way
to protect the data.

344
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,370
We see some customers using this as a way

345
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,450
to control access to the
data where if you log in

346
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,170
with a certain identity,
then certain fields,

347
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,540
let's say in a big query
table are encrypted

348
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,420
and you can't see it, as
you only get to see the ones

349
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,890
that you really need. Right?

350
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,939
And so, combined with
granular level access

351
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,710
that's being built into the
storage systems and encryption,

352
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,750
you can start to build together

353
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,260
a really meaningful data protection state.

354
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,400
The other thing that I'm
seeing a lot of options are

355
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,470
is in data de-identification
and anonymization.

356
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,530
And a lot of you may have
heard of differential privacy,

357
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,250
which attempts to add noise to data

358
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,460
so that you can okay still
get information from the data,

359
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,690
but you won't be able to re-identify

360
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,770
any of the people in the data. Right?

361
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,400
And so those types of
techniques are starting to grow

362
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,970
so that people can do
things like share data.

363
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,500
If you think about the
healthcare industry, you,

364
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,010
as a provider, you may
really wanna share some data.

365
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,120
As a healthcare provider,
you may wanna share data

366
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,190
with research so that
you can get more insights

367
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,870
and be able to take that information

368
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,510
back and help your patients.

369
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,340
And so sharing that data in a way

370
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,220
that doesn't identify the patient,

371
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,120
but allows them to do that
research becomes really crucial.

372
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,640
And so, these trends in
data de-identification

373
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,763
and anonymization are
really starting to grow.

374
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,040
And then finally, we've
talked a lot already

375
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,990
about reporting and compliance
where the main thing

376
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,940
that we're seeing happening there

377
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,190
is really around the consultant services.

378
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,630
But another thing that I wanna
talk about is recommenders.

379
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,300
And I think different hyperscalers

380
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,190
call them different things,

381
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,319
like you'll hear a trusted
advisor or recommenders.

382
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,700
But really what the idea is
that they're using information,

383
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,819
typically metadata about
how you use the platform

384
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,659
to help you be more efficient
in the cloud and more secure.

385
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,200
So are you over permissioning
your IAM permissions?

386
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,010
Do you have IAM permissions
that you've granted

387
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,810
to a role and that never get used? Right?

388
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,700
And so those types of things are starting

389
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,880
to happen a lot more across
the different hyperscalers

390
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,020
to help people stay in a secure place,

391
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,340
to stay in a more efficient...

392
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,550
Actually really just to save money. Right?

393
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,240
Cost savings, because we know
when we're working in cloud,

394
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,490
one of the big things is trying

395
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,250
to control that budget. Right?

396
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,413
And so this is an area,

397
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,110
there's a trend that I'm
starting to see happen

398
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,199
across a lot of cloud providers,

399
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,550
as well as continuous monitoring
of the compliance posture.

400
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,370
And now this is typically
it started with some

401
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,010
of the other frameworks like
PCI for payment information

402
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,110
and some of the other more
standards like the CIS benchmark.

403
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,439
But this is slowly starting
to go into the privacy space.

404
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,900
So, I wouldn't be surprised if soon,

405
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,900
if you start to see CCPA
monitoring available

406
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,121
in different types of SAP tooling

407
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:23,770
that has been provided
by the cloud providers

408
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,010
and typically used for
things like threat detection,

409
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,920
now being used to detect
compliance failures.

410
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,550
Those are things that's
starting to come up quite a bit.

411
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,770
And then, privacy risk assessment
services, another trend.

412
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,040
I think One Trust, I think
is one of the best examples

413
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,860
that I can think of here
where they can help you create

414
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,080
the data protection impact assessment

415
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,100
that you have to complete

416
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,870
for the General Data Protection
Regulation in Europe.

417
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,669
Right, and so how do you have...

418
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,090
So it's really about
creating an assessment

419
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,179
that helps you identify

420
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,900
these are the highest
privacy risk activities

421
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,733
that I'm doing.

422
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,639
Data processing activities that I'm doing,

423
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,190
and then put a plan around it to identify,

424
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,950
this is what the data is.

425
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,330
This is the processing that's happening,

426
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,110
and this is the way we're protecting it

427
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,540
and ensuring that it doesn't get disclosed

428
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,033
to any unauthorized person.

429
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,360
So, the market has
changed to help people out

430
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,060
with all of these privacy challenges.

431
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,580
So, what can you do so
that you can help yourself

432
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,179
do better at cloud and cloud privacy?

433
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,120
One thing, definitely move

434
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,360
towards data classification
centric privacy policies.

435
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,929
This goes back to the things I was saying

436
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,520
about policy as code.

437
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,780
Once you have a really good
data classification model

438
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,133
then you can start to say,
when I have this type of data,

439
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,760
when my infrastructure
sees this type of data,

440
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,290
then I can automatically
apply these policies.

441
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,270
So, having data classifications
such as you privacy policies

442
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,040
will really help, from that perspective.

443
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,440
It will also help you understand,

444
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,280
if you do live in a hybrid model

445
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,530
where some of the data stays on-premise

446
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,326
and some of it goes to the cloud,

447
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,520
this classification of data
is fine go to the cloud,

448
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,160
and then you can create proxies around it

449
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,820
to make sure that as data leaves

450
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,129
from your on-premise to the cloud,

451
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,920
that it doesn't take any of that data

452
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,593
that's not been approved and
classified to go to the cloud.

453
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,070
We talked about policy as code.

454
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,290
I think the biggest
thing for driving policy

455
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,629
into the infrastructure
really are two things.

456
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,230
One is when you get to
that ability to preview

457
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,910
the impact of the changes

458
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,270
will be significant value to you.

459
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,510
And then two, it's just really difficult

460
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,530
to continue to manage policies

461
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,700
as people have done today
through spreadsheets

462
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,120
and basically living as tribal knowledge.

463
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,909
When you can start to get
it into the infrastructure

464
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,000
and you can take the burden
off people to enforce policy

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,790
and really let the infrastructure do

466
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,633
some of that heavy lifting for you.

467
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,270
Data minimization through
de-identification,

468
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,870
anonymization, like I said, again,

469
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,072
you can minimize your risk,

470
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,330
and you can actually kind
of minimize the types

471
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,360
of regulations you have to adhere to,

472
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,990
if you can anonymize the data, right?

473
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,870
Because most of the privacy
regulations really apply

474
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,120
to personal data the if data is anonymous,

475
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,540
it is no longer personal. Right?

476
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,240
And then finally is stop planning

477
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,810
for the cloud provider audits
and getting their access logs

478
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,190
and how to migrate your processes

479
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,300
because what people really struggle with

480
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,720
is they look at these
compliance frameworks

481
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,950
and these standards and
they're looking at it

482
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,550
from a lens of being on-prem.

483
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,919
And then when you go to the cloud,

484
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,420
you're not really sure which
part you're supposed to do

485
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,100
and what part the cloud provider does.

486
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,490
And so, if you start looking
at their audits, right,

487
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,210
that they make available to you,

488
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,620
they're looking at how they do things,

489
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,679
making sure that you can
have oversight from them,

490
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,560
from the access logs that you generate

491
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,270
as well as they should
be able to provide you

492
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,760
with access logs of
their support personnel

493
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,910
and their engineers.

494
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,150
And just leverage that
to really understand

495
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,150
your full privacy posture
on that cloud provider.

496
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,090
The more you prepare for
that earlier, the better.

497
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,740
I would say immediately

498
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,370
do that last thing I was just
talking about figuring out

499
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,709
how to integrate the cloud provider audits

500
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,100
into your processes and your
standard compliance processes.

501
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,060
Assessing the frameworks
that you care about

502
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,730
in your organization
today and see how suitable

503
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,470
they are for different types
of cloud security models.

504
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,230
Whether you're building a
cloud native application

505
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,680
or doing a lift and shift into the cloud.

506
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,560
And then I would say over the longer term,

507
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,320
the more you can start
to move your policies

508
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,060
towards a data centric,
data-driven approach

509
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,919
to scale your policies and to move it more

510
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,940
into the infrastructure.

511
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,020
I think that you'll
find that you'll be able

512
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,299
to monitor your privacy policies better

513
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,680
and that you will have more confidence

514
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,620
as you go into your different audit cycles

515
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,179
to show that you are truly
doing the best that you can

516
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,940
to protect the privacy of your users.

517
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,890
Now, with that said, that's
all I had for this talk.

518
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,790
I would love to talk to you more.

519
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,510
As a reminder, I'll be
in the discussion forum

520
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,150
that's available after this
session to answer any questions.

521
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,350
So, if you hop on over
to the networking lounge,

522
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,100
you can connect with me live there.
