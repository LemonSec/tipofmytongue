I'd now like to turn it
over to Magda Chelly,

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,983
for the presentation.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,130
- Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,130
for attending my talk today.

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,530
I will be discussing Getting the Security

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,360
and Flexibility Balance Right

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,140
in a COVID- 19 World,

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,490
where things are changing

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,530
and disrupting the way that security

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,980
is perceived and
processed and implemented.

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,489
So let me give you a
little bit more insight

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,560
about my experiences nowadays
working with various companies

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,410
across the world

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,729
and in particular in Asia Pacific.

26
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,810
But before that,

27
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,960
let me give you a little bit
more perspective about myself.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,550
So, I am a telecommunication engineer

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,950
with a specialization in cyber security,

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,230
and I have been working

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,010
as a chief information security officer

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,050
for like I mentioned
a variety of companies

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,420
across different industries.

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,160
What I have as well noticed is that,

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,789
different perspectives
bring different questions.

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,860
And therefore please do not hesitate

37
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,253
to ask me any questions
like Casey mentioned.

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,940
You probably see and read nowadays

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,380
variety of news about cyber security,

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,820
and one of the main areas or approach

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,979
coming back from the general public

42
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,600
or your business stakeholders is,

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,899
that they might not understand

44
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,360
what exactly is happening
for the business nowadays

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,570
and how they can tackle those

46
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,139
particular new emerging risks,

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,870
knowing that they are not in our field

48
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,673
or they are not cyber
security professionals.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,169
Within those questions,

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,649
might arise very simple ones,

51
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,368
like are the cyber attacks

52
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,660
increasing during COVID-19 pandemic?

53
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,760
Or, what other changes that my company

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,817
will actually be faced to

55
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,130
or faced towards within
risk again pandemic,

56
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,420
knowing that I needed to shift

57
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,542
in a digital transformation very quickly?

58
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,720
As part of Asia Pacific,

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,930
where I am familiar
with in terms of region,

60
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,400
I noticed that,

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,880
the digital transformation

62
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,019
that had been adopted by companies

63
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,960
is very much related to a sense of speed.

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,940
We need to go

65
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,510
and allow the productivity to continue

66
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,890
for our employees,

67
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,149
and very often,

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,210
that digital transformation is not driven

69
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,210
by let's say the regulatory requirements

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,200
or eventually by the cyber security team

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,433
involved from the
beginning of the project.

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,820
Therefore in particular within the certain

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,450
I would say environment like
nowadays with the COVID-19,

74
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,634
we see that need into going

75
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:17,709
in that transformation very quickly

76
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,640
and unknowingly raising
new emerging risks.

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,959
And as part of that,

78
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,937
I'm sure you're aware cyber
security professionals

79
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:29,590
with the emerging and
increasing cyber attacks

80
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,493
and as usual,

81
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:35,000
the weakest link is the human factor.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,250
And with additional COVID-19 themed,

83
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,590
phishing attacks,

84
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,530
malware banks attacks,

85
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,600
and even fake social medias

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,310
as well as vishing attacks.

87
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,730
We see that our enterprise
attack vectors are increasing

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,410
and we do not have eventually
that much control over,

89
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,470
especially when we're talking for example

90
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,750
about vishing attacks.

91
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,480
And here, I would actually add one point

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,679
that I consider extremely important,

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,900
when I discuss this

94
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,853
with chief information security officers

95
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,203
as well from other organizations,

96
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,940
we have seen new policies mentioning that,

97
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,390
you know, passwords should
not rotate for example,

98
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,610
or that we change the way

99
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,270
that we literally have
our policies nowadays.

100
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,460
But if your employees
are working from home

101
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,039
and eventually working
from their own devices,

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,040
they are using those devices
to perform business activities,

103
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,670
and eventually even if you had
employed management in place,

104
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,420
you might still be exposed

105
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,770
to different risks in our loops.

106
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,690
And as such one of those scenario is,

107
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,620
and normally always
using the same password

108
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,480
using the passwords with them,

109
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,730
their social media accounts

110
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,983
and the same password with
their corporate accounts,

111
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,990
and you don't have control over that

112
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,580
because the employee has
the freedom to do that

113
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,010
and using especially their own devices.

114
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,325
So this is an example of scenarios

115
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:17,313
that definitely is increasing
within the COVID-19 pandemic.

116
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,520
But as such again,

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,556
I think there is a certain
level of perception

118
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,920
from the security professionals

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,730
that you have control,

120
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,680
because you would have
implemented certain controls

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,070
over people process and technology

122
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,040
that you'd reduced your risk.

123
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,070
You have your proper comfort zone

124
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,460
which you have been operating with

125
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,310
and you believe that that might still work

126
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,230
even if your employees
are working remotely.

127
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,860
Well yes, in a particular case,

128
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,720
but let's again,

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,700
go back to the fact that your employees

130
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,450
are working from anywhere
towards insecure networks

131
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,639
or even just working from
a different environment

132
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,890
that they will or have been used to.

133
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,890
As an example quarantining hotels

134
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,840
or quarantined in other
environments besides

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
or in addition of their own houses.

136
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,300
What they will do as a very simple example

137
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,630
is that they will use their email

138
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,600
to communicate with businesses,

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,360
to communicate with different stakeholders

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,823
including eventually cold clients.

141
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,097
And as one other risks, you know,

142
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,760
and I would say different
scenarios that happens

143
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,300
is that if the employee is
facing any technical challenges

144
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,292
by communicating through
the corporate email,

145
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:43,109
they will use their personal email

146
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,220
and this is again,

147
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,347
something that realistically happen

148
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:48,450
comparing to our comfort zone

149
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,120
where we think we have
our very good controls

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,637
in place across our environment

151
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:56,650
within the corporate environment.

152
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,929
We actually are not seeing

153
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,940
or not addressing those
new emerging risks.

154
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,410
That again, within the COVID-19
are increasing and growing.

155
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,630
What happens if your employees nowadays

156
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,340
are sending emails,

157
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,810
not only with confidential information

158
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,750
back to the customers

159
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,350
using their personal emails.

160
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,230
And when the slide that
you see on the screen

161
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,650
I'm just bringing up those simple examples

162
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,179
of COVID-19 themed attack.

163
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,360
And if you want to raise
awareness with the mere employees

164
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,270
which is again,

165
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,443
a risk that is increasing
nowadays with the COVID-19.

166
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,200
A simple newsletter bringing that example

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,539
will not be enough,

168
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,040
because of the example that I gave you.

169
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,640
They might use additional
channel of communication

170
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,693
in order to overcome any
technical difficulties as such,

171
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:55,670
let us say in accessing
the corporate resources

172
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,950
or eventually just the fact that

173
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,950
they are using a different laptop

174
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,270
or they newly joined your organization

175
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,682
and they do not have access
to the corporate email.

176
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,409
Having a perception of perfection

177
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,350
or thinking that you have a control

178
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,940
over your corporate environment nowadays,

179
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,560
is not any more effective.

180
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,140
And when I mentioned the effectiveness

181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,310
or some examples of scenarios,

182
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,990
I was lucky to think as a
cyber security professional,

183
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,230
of the different perspectives
of business stakeholders,

184
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,740
because at the end

185
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,220
even if we as security professionals,

186
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,809
we would like to address

187
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,989
all the cyber risks properly

188
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,919
and address those risks come of course

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,839
by either treating them

190
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,870
or transferring them or accepting them.

191
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,080
We actually need to understand

192
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,774
that its still resides within
the business stakeholders,

193
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:57,774
as business decision makers
to take the right decision.

194
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,233
And usually their perspective

195
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,180
or their questions are different.

196
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,750
They questions might be
related to eventually,

197
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,550
how are they exposures,

198
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,300
but not exposures with them.

199
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,099
Okay, they are new technical risks,

200
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,030
but they wont like to
associate financial loss

201
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,970
to any new emerging risks

202
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,483
and what that might
mean today on business.

203
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,030
And the reality is that

204
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,760
we as cyber security professionals

205
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,439
we still do not know how
to address that problem.

206
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,520
So if our environment is changing,

207
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,439
and our corporate boundaries
are not any more present,

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,130
like we have seen previously.

209
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,330
We are not able to adapt to that

210
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,950
as quickly as the business change

211
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,030
with the digital transformation,

212
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,510
including something that is very new

213
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,069
for especially cyber
security professionals,

214
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,606
which is risk quantification's.

215
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,280
And then we try to bring that

216
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,180
as a very important key process,

217
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,170
and show how to ensure

218
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,290
that your business stakeholders

219
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,680
are able to address the new emerging risks

220
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,089
within the COVID-19 pandemic

221
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,860
and especially post COVID-19 pandemic,

222
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,590
because we will see a great shift

223
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,380
and you as cyber security
professional know that very well,

224
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,533
about how to translate that

225
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,687
into business risk

226
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,343
and how to ensure that you deliver

227
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:31,550
a continuous cyber risk
assessment when it comes

228
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,699
to shifting continuously
businesses provide,

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,840
especially with uncertain environment.

230
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,780
And when I say uncertain environment,

231
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,610
we actually are in very
particular scenario

232
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,569
in general for businesses.

233
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,290
We're now talking about,

234
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,290
what I would say in a
like, you know, event,

235
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,601
we're talking about a
continuously changing

236
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,570
uncertainty within the uncertainty.

237
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,140
We are unable to have very
clear visibility of when

238
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,140
and how the new coming
waves of COVID-19 pandemics

239
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,020
will affect our work,

240
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,280
will affect our environment.

241
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,069
And as a cyber security professional,

242
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,760
this means that we will have

243
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,230
waves of employees continuously
working from the office,

244
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,240
then will be asked to work again remotely

245
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,010
and then again will eventually
come back to the office,

246
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,413
and again, come back and work remotely.

247
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,500
What that means in particular,

248
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,400
is that, yeah, you perhaps know,

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,340
and you might think that
we have this boundaries,

250
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,453
we have the controls

251
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:43,319
that help us enable the corporate controls

252
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,150
across our environments

253
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,030
and that should be enough.

254
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,610
But I believe,

255
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,580
that we have still a very big gap.

256
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,170
Not only from the security perspective

257
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,500
with our business stakeholders

258
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,920
and how do we present our cyber risks,

259
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,000
but as well,

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,390
understanding the gap between

261
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,620
us cyber security professionals

262
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,570
and what the end users are doing

263
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,510
and what the end users are expecting

264
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,140
and in particular our employees.

265
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,840
Because whatever we implement nowadays,

266
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,170
we need to implement it

267
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,420
to ensure a certain
level of effectiveness.

268
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,829
And when we're talking
about effectiveness,

269
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,080
we're talking about,

270
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,700
our employees ensuring the right process,

271
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,190
our employees being aware

272
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,940
of the right security measures

273
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,192
that we have in place,

274
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:35,863
in our companies with our organizations.

275
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:39,260
And one of the very famous

276
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,290
I would say model around
risk quantification

277
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,140
is The FAIR Model.

278
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,860
And the factor analysis
of information risk

279
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,290
is the only international standard

280
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,170
that helps quantify the
information security

281
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,040
and operational risk,

282
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,543
which is again something
that I have very rarely seen

283
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:03,605
implemented by changing
information security officer.

284
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:08,605
So when it comes to ensuring
that quantification model,

285
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,740
let me tell you an example

286
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,340
of how it can be
extremely relevant for you

287
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,200
to help the business
migrate over an environment

288
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
that is raising uncertainty.

289
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,640
You have your risk register,

290
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,794
you have your risk
management process nowadays

291
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,470
implemented within your organization.

292
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,030
And you're addressing
those risks in a way,

293
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,310
for example following certain
international standards

294
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,010
making sure that you have
visibility of maturity

295
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,240
and eventually adding the
percentage of implementations

296
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
and using that as an important way

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,301
to report to your board,

298
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,520
to your business stakeholders,

299
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,872
to C level executives depending
of how you report nowadays.

300
00:13:56,873 --> 00:14:00,760
However again, if the business
is within an environment

301
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,850
that is changing very quickly,

302
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,940
you might want to take
a different approach,

303
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,520
the quantification of risk might help you,

304
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,410
bringing up three or five
or even 10 risks, you know,

305
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,030
it was an extremely important

306
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,079
and critical for your business

307
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,288
helping to understand
what those scenarios are

308
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:25,340
bringing to the business

309
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,500
or how those scenarios are
impacting your business

310
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
and then clearly describing
that impact to your business.

311
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,860
So now your telling me what
I already knew Magda, right?

312
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,610
Because we're doing that already.

313
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,670
I am gonna show you some
examples for the COVID-19

314
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,089
and what factors or what criteria

315
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,360
you should be taking consideration.

316
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
Again, going back or going
out of your comfort zone

317
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,430
as a security professional,

318
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,410
and taking consideration
some business factors,

319
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,439
some regulatory requirements,

320
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
some shifting areas around
the risks within the COVID-19,

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
but as well as from the
compliance perspective

322
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,113
and privacy perspective as well.

323
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:11,310
Individuals and organizations
are fighting COVID-19

324
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,142
as I mentioned,

325
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:16,110
we would probably have different waves,

326
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,290
and that means,

327
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,089
different shifts across the organizations.

328
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,320
Not only having that visibility
about social distancing

329
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,750
that we have in certain countries nowadays

330
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,240
CROSS Asia Pacific.

331
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,940
We might continuously
have different arrangement

332
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,440
across working habits.

333
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,460
You're employees might face

334
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,180
different crises communications,

335
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,540
different travel restrictions,

336
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,920
especially if you operate
across different countries.

337
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,329
That means, that your remote
working controls nowadays

338
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,350
might need to adapt.

339
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,660
Again, imagining environment

340
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,160
where your employees are
going back a certain time

341
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,980
then going out of the office,

342
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,490
you still need to hire new employees.

343
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,400
The old employees on boarding,

344
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,090
my place, new risk

345
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,800
and therefore new challenges for you

346
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,170
as cyber security professionals.

347
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,120
Go out of your comfort zone,

348
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,160
where you have control
over your environment

349
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,170
because nowadays with evolving risks

350
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,390
that are changing,

351
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,420
you don't have any more that comfort

352
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,959
you're actually in need to build

353
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,660
different risk management process.

354
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,870
And that risk management process

355
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,080
need to take in
consideration and certainty

356
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,357
within the uncertainty.

357
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,740
As you have seen this model of, you know,

358
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,480
going into different shifts of risks,

359
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,300
I would add a different level of again,

360
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,680
things that eventually you are aware of

361
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,242
and we talk about shadow IT,

362
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,693
but the shadow IT goes beyond.

363
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,550
We are talking about
unsecured home networks.

364
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,969
We're talking about employees

365
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,770
working from quarantined entities

366
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,478
or environments like hotels.

367
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:06,748
And then here,

368
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:07,580
you will tell me,

369
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,550
"But Magda we have or we
are using virtual pilot

370
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,589
and that works.

371
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,050
Again, we have proper controls in place."

372
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,359
That's right I've seen choice.

373
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,046
And well, I will tell you,

374
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:19,195
"What will your employees do

375
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:23,669
if you're actually VPN
will not be allowed within

376
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,390
that particular unsecured network,

377
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,210
because the reality is,

378
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,140
that nowadays certain public networks,

379
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,070
WiFi networks in particular

380
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,230
within shared environments like hotels

381
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,150
or other entities do
not allow VPNs to work.

382
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,470
And therefor again,

383
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,410
you might know those kind of scenarios

384
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,420
but the scenarios are shifting.

385
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,420
The scenarios that you need
to rake in consideration

386
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,900
will need you a cyber
security professional

387
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,490
to have visibility of the major high

388
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,479
and critical risk scenarios,

389
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,930
taking in consideration,

390
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,823
the shift and risk profile of companies.

391
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,530
The risk profiles as I mentioned,

392
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,790
as an example,

393
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,800
traditional VPNs not working

394
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,639
for your employees to connect,

395
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,950
raising a different way of working.

396
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,700
Your employees might be exposed
to additional network risks

397
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,600
or just cyber risk,

398
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,379
but that was only challenge

399
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,130
that I want you to think about.

400
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,560
The other challenge in
this particular region

401
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,350
is new privacy law,

402
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,149
new laws sorry,

403
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,420
that include the fact that companies

404
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,205
will need to implement
additional technology

405
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:42,210
to monitor social distancing regulations

406
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,780
or requirements within the regulation.

407
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,613
And as such,

408
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,100
one really interesting

409
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,760
is the fact that in some countries

410
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,230
we might not only have new privacy laws

411
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,910
including data breach regulations,

412
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,460
which this is not
something that is changing

413
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,880
but we might have again,

414
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,880
laws that it needs or required
to implement CCTV cameras,

415
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,253
every where within your
organizations environment.

416
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,370
And while we are talking about that,

417
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,219
if your organization is
implementing new technology,

418
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,010
we as cyber security professionals

419
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,270
we know that this requires
a risk assessment,

420
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,420
this requires some controls

421
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,207
and we probably are taking
that into already consideration

422
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,430
within the traditional
boundaries of our business.

423
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,690
But, if your business
nowadays operate in countries

424
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,690
where those laws are enacted
or enabled very quickly.

425
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,510
You might find yourself,

426
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,890
operating in an environment

427
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,400
where your business stakeholders

428
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,813
took the decision to implement CCTVs

429
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,170
across the business organization,

430
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,540
without that particular assessment

431
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,680
and without knowing

432
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,730
of how your cyber security controls

433
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,352
are efficient to implement.

434
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,860
So here, as you can see,

435
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,939
I'm trying to describe
a way of how to ensure

436
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,680
that you have visibility
of new emerging risks

437
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,280
with the current challenging environment.

438
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,649
So again, the funny thing about the slide

439
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,670
is out of your comfort zone

440
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,970
and try and focus on
quantifying risk across

441
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,174
the new emerging, new scenarios,

442
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,330
that might relate to uncertainty.

443
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,379
When I mean uncertainty,

444
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,190
it might be three, five 10 new risks,

445
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,297
within the environment.

446
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,850
And those risks are not taking

447
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,300
the traditional business perimeter

448
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,810
in consideration anymore.

449
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,480
We are actually working nowadays

450
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,120
without boundaries anymore.

451
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,590
So what I'm adding nowadays again,

452
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,830
I'm adding for you a
different perspective.

453
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,953
Try to ensure that you work very closely

454
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,460
with the other teams

455
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,780
in collaboration with the privacy team,

456
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,350
with the compliance team.

457
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,389
And don't feel that we as
cyber security professionals

458
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,960
we like that kind of collaboration

459
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
and ensure that you have
a proper communication

460
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,240
with your employees in general.

461
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,450
As a cyber security professional,

462
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,440
and especially as a chief
information security professional,

463
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,120
especially when you're global reach,

464
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,330
ensure that you're still are reachable,

465
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,995
because your new emergency lines,

466
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:31,290
not only will require you to take

467
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,610
in consideration this very particular

468
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,530
new risks you now use

469
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,570
that you will need to quantify,

470
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,570
but as well as that
you've taken consideration

471
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,570
of reality versus your perfect, you know,

472
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,720
a simulation of your control today

473
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,100
that you have implemented

474
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,590
within the traditional
approaches of cyber security.

475
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,897
I mentioned the fact
that certain environment

476
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,889
might not allow your VPN to work,

477
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:00,110
your VPN might face technical issues

478
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,510
and therefore make ways to situations

479
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,000
where your employees will use

480
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,947
additional channels of communication

481
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,090
including their personal emails

482
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,668
to communicate with clients,

483
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,254
to communicate with colleagues.

484
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:15,040
That particular true scenarios

485
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,923
what might raise risks like data loss.

486
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,030
And again, please feel
free to ask me questions

487
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,470
I'm available live.

488
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,890
So do raise some of the challenge

489
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,723
that you're facing,

490
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,770
I'm more than happy to address them.

491
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,060
The other of course approach is,

492
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,909
or risks that we see is,

493
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,290
raising risks where
COVID-19 themed attacks

494
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,800
which you're familiar with.

495
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,911
But again, if your employees are using,

496
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,920
bring your own device

497
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,680
then actually might not
have the same controls.

498
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,320
You might have say saying some

499
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,010
additional business interruptions

500
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,280
because they just on boarding,

501
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,410
they are new.

502
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,410
So, very important new
cyber risk assessment

503
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,307
is go out of your comfort zone

504
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:02,440
and go again,

505
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm repeating myself

506
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,649
that's very important.

507
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,060
Have your top three, five, 10

508
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,790
new emerging cyber risks know use

509
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,510
and then quantify them.

510
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,070
Now you tell me how do we
quantify such new emerging risk

511
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,760
if you don't have data related to those?

512
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,610
Because of course,

513
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,590
when we're talking about quantification,

514
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,230
we need to take in
consideration proper data,

515
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,760
will ensure that we have a certain model.

516
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,067
We're not talking about,

517
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:37,420
"Oh, we will have an attack
from cyber security perspective.

518
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,150
This is how I see it
will impact the business,

519
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,080
approximately I might impact the business

520
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,179
with 10 million of loss if that happens."

521
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
No again, try to ensure

522
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,360
that you work closely
with the privacy team

523
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,070
or a compliance team

524
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,580
and have a visibility of how,

525
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,639
your business might be interrupted.

526
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,637
And when I say interruption here,

527
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:01,637
I forgot to mention that
you need to work as well

528
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:05,169
very closely with your IT team.

529
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,240
And if you work with your IT team,

530
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,277
eventually you might understand

531
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:10,870
a little bit further

532
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,052
how long it takes to
recover your business,

533
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,897
if that happens.

534
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,399
And if you have a clarity
about your business

535
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,520
or your cyber risk scenarios

536
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,230
then you decide,

537
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,020
very clearly what are your factors

538
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,730
that you will take in consideration

539
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,260
to molder your business
risk quantification.

540
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,470
Then, only then,

541
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,575
you will be able to very clearly

542
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,107
understand the business impact

543
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:42,020
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic

544
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,963
and especially after
and post the pandemic,

545
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,250
because again, we're not
talking about one way,

546
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,180
we're talking about an environment

547
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,750
that is going through
different ways or uncertainty

548
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,210
and therefore we assign
the strict previsions

549
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,980
we need to adapt to those risks.

550
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,460
And as I am very conscious of time.

551
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,190
I don't have more than 13 minutes.

552
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,620
I would like to again,

553
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,850
to focus on data,

554
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,939
which is very important
nowadays and human.

555
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,490
As cyber security professionals

556
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,400
we need to really
increase our capabilities

557
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,330
within those two points

558
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,010
not any more boundaries

559
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,080
or traditional corporate environment.

560
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,530
And we need to understand

561
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,770
that if we don't communicate
with our employees,

562
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,930
we are not effective

563
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,277
because they will always find way

564
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,260
to ensure that they work

565
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,600
and therefore they perform
their business activities,

566
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,429
even beyond your boundaries,

567
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,190
beyond your traditional
channels of communication.

568
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,740
That's the reality.

569
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,690
And I believe we still lack that

570
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,470
actually consideration with
our risk management process

571
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,233
that is taking traditional approach.

572
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,050
So my point today for you is,

573
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,603
again, ensure data driven spirited.

574
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,900
Try to focus on the data

575
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,810
and the human with a
zero trust in the future,

576
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,000
that obey the approach, you know,

577
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,650
anymore taking the traditional boundaries,

578
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,350
but also a continuous
cyber risk assessment

579
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,679
and that continuous cyber risk assessment

580
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,660
is not by having a very long risk register

581
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,910
with technical scenarios.

582
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,060
Just try to ensure that

583
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,250
you have continuously review

584
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,817
three, five, eventually 10,

585
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,100
and 10 I think is already long,

586
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,740
risks scenarios that you try to quantify.

587
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,290
When you quantify those
particular risk scenarios,

588
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,920
you take in consideration,

589
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,640
factors that are important
for the business,

590
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,830
privacy regulation or regulatory fines,

591
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,480
licenses for your business,

592
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,190
you work very closely with
different departments,

593
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,153
business interactions
when you work with your IT

594
00:26:57,153 --> 00:27:00,560
and have visibility of
how long they will take

595
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,320
to actually recover from
certain business interruption.

596
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,062
So have visibility.

597
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:08,500
And of course that visibility,

598
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,190
not only closes the gap,

599
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,540
with reality of your
employees working differently,

600
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,950
but as well helps you to communicate

601
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,900
with your business stakeholders,

602
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,030
being realistic and bringing some dollars

603
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,270
to your cyber risk scenarios.

604
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,550
Well done, just approximative data

605
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,610
that is related to...

606
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,689
Oh, I think we have seen this data bridge

607
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,230
or the cyber attack we'll
leave in our industry

608
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,820
for the particular loss.

609
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,939
No, if you're taking
consideration something

610
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,200
that is realistic for your business,

611
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,470
it will speak to a business stakeholder

612
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,950
and they will understand,

613
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,800
they will understand that the employees

614
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,697
will find ways to work differently,

615
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:55,670
where you as a business need
to take in consideration

616
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,880
different factors and that might lead

617
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,740
to certain level of again,

618
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,950
losses indoors to the business.

619
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,050
So as a new approach,

620
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,020
again, taking a data-centric approach

621
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,010
is extremely important.

622
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,080
Improving authentication in
communication with the users,

623
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,780
no matter what you actually have in place,

624
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,170
remember your end users might
be your cyber champions.

625
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,243
Stop, remember that,

626
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,810
that education training is very important.

627
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,340
Having something that is
just send over newsletters

628
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,949
every week, every quarter

629
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,060
is absolutely inefficient.

630
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,649
I have worked with organizations

631
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,490
where the employees don't even know

632
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,400
that there was chief information security

633
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,350
or a security department because of that.

634
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,669
Make sure that you are reachable, how?

635
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,083
By first, next week identifying

636
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,470
your new emergent risks

637
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,110
and making sure that you
have the right controls

638
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,523
for those emerging risks

639
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,490
that are beyond your traditional way

640
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,200
of doing cyber security.

641
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
They do not have any more perimeter,

642
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,360
they are raising realistic risks

643
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,100
compared to whatever you
thought was previously.

644
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,600
In the next three months,

645
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,750
ensure that your approach
is taking in consideration

646
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,863
and non-perimeter based security.

647
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,340
As well, with not only a data driven,

648
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,470
as I mentioned in those are big concepts,

649
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,430
but practical approach,

650
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,250
focus of a example on a data
loss prevention strategy,

651
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,190
rather than just ensuring some
tools for a VPN connectivity,

652
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,150
because eventually, as I mentioned,

653
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,210
if your organization
working within countries

654
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,790
where your employees are working

655
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,580
from quarantined environments

656
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,990
they might eventually
face technical issues.

657
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,260
So how do you ensure that your trust of?

658
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,050
But again here,

659
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,360
ensure that you talk

660
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,419
or discuss with your employees

661
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,413
in a way that they understand,

662
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,920
in a way that they feel you're reachable.

663
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,940
And then within the next six month,

664
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,830
have a cyber security strategy

665
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,610
that takes in consideration again,

666
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,540
data and human.

667
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,600
Humans are the weakest link,

668
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,669
but we don't change it.

669
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,230
We keep on talking about without
really taking the actions

670
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,140
and actions are two in particular.

671
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,620
Have a simple communication,

672
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,530
coming back to fundamentals,

673
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,230
even by explaining very,
very, very essential things.

674
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,513
And two, talk with the employees

675
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:22,983
as some security professionals,

676
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,909
because if they don't
feel they can reach you,

677
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,160
nothing will change,

678
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,010
it is a cultural change.

679
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,470
And that's where I would
like you to remember.

680
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,160
So thank you very much.

681
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,540
I'm conscious about time.

682
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,010
I hope you learned something

683
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,100
that is very viable for you today.

684
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,250
Please reach out with questions.

685
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,701
I'm happy to answer.

686
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:44,930
And again, one last point,

687
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,690
go out of your comfort zone

688
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,700
because we are changing,

689
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,100
we're not anymore within our perimeter

690
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,740
or our traditional environment.

691
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,573
Thank you again,

692
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,483
this was Magda Chelly from Singapore.
