00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,390
- [Announcer] The Vendorpedia
platform is purpose built

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,910
to automate the third
party risk life cycle

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,960
with three core capabilities,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,910
assessments and due diligence,

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,580
global risk exchange,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,563
and vendor chasing services.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,869
- Hello, and welcome to
beyond penetration testing,

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,170
developing a defensive cyber workforce.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,350
If you're joining us live,

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,639
I'd now like to turn it over

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,923
to Keyaan Williams for the presentation.

16
00:00:58,227 --> 00:00:59,769
- Ladies and gentlemen,

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,680
thank you for joining me,

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,150
I'm glad that of the sessions
that you had to choose from,

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,076
that you did choose to
attend this session.

20
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:08,789
I'm honored that this
is my second opportunity

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,068
to support the RSA conference.

22
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:13,280
I spoke live and in person

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,508
in San Francisco earlier this year,

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,100
and although I was looking forward

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,220
to being physically in Singapore,

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,100
I'm excited that we still
have the opportunity

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,773
to share the information
with you virtually.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,840
One of the reasons

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,220
for this presentation
is my love of people.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,480
From a security perspective,

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,070
people are always talking about the idea

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,100
that your security program
depends heavily on people,

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,729
processes and technology,

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,810
but the focus of what everybody
really invest their time

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,920
and energy in,

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,950
is more on the process side,

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,250
or on the technology side.

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,010
Part of my conversation today is going

39
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,280
to focus on the people part of security,

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,167
which is very much in line
with the human element theme,

41
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,400
that RSA conference has been
promoting throughout the year.

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,360
The idea that cybersecurity
provides confidentiality,

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,330
integrity and availability,

44
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,610
for the environment,

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,760
for the organization,

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,230
for your infrastructure,

47
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,330
and for your data is very important,

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,389
and surely,

49
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,309
we can not accomplish those
goals without technology,

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,261
but it's the people behind the technology

51
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,531
that make the biggest
difference for the success

52
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:18,790
of the organization and for your programs.

53
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,370
What you'll find as we go
through this presentation,

54
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,520
is that while technology is important,

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,460
the capability, the wisdom, the intuition,

56
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,630
and the actions of the
people on your security team,

57
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,600
and the people in your environment,

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,880
make a huge difference about
the success of your program

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
and how well it works

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,410
to support the risk management

61
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,090
and cybersecurity goals
of the organization.

62
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,160
Now this is focused on people

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,920
and the title says Beyond
Penetration Testing,

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,299
it would not be fair for me to say

65
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,730
that penetration testing has no value,

66
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,630
what I'd strive to express,

67
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,290
is that although
penetration testing is sexy,

68
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,890
that everybody's excited about it,

69
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,361
that everybody wants
to be on the red team,

70
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:02,570
the real magic of your security program,

71
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,470
happens with those
people who are dedicated

72
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,180
to the blue team efforts,

73
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,140
to working to defend the organization,

74
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,721
to understanding the myriad of attacks

75
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,130
that the organization is facing,

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,350
so that you put the right
counter measures in place,

77
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,609
and also so that you respond properly

78
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,090
when the worst case scenario does happen.

79
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,260
Usually there's much more
emphasis on offensive practices,

80
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,117
this is where you get things like the CEH,

81
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,380
that focuses on ethical hacking,

82
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,810
this is where everybody is focused

83
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,770
on cyber defense from an
offensive perspective,

84
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,900
rather than saying that your
best defense is the priority,

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,600
people focus on what is the best offense,

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,940
so that we can identify the weaknesses.

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,290
In reality, the role of the blue team,

88
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,720
to understand the entire
scope of the situation,

89
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,170
everything that the organization is doing,

90
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,351
and to fix every hole

91
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,842
that possibly exists as part
of the threat landscape,

92
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:01,600
and the collection of
vulnerabilities that you're facing,

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,859
is a much harder job,

94
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,410
and it really demands a much higher level

95
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,660
of focus if organizations are going

96
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,692
to continue to be successful.

97
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,470
And when you think about
red team and blue team,

98
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,930
generally these concepts are understood,

99
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,500
because this is a learning session,

100
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,550
it's important that we define the terms,

101
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,190
and make sure that everybody
is on the same page.

102
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,650
When we're talking about a red team,

103
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,770
your red team is often
comprised of a small number

104
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,393
of technical experts who work

105
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,650
in defined holes in your defenses.

106
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,483
When we say hole,

107
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:34,180
this could be common
vulnerabilities and exposures,

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,810
it could be unpatched systems,

109
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,290
it could be vulnerabilities that exist

110
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,860
in your software and your
infrastructure or in the network,

111
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,730
and in this context,

112
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,100
success for the red team,

113
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,230
is simply just finding that one hole,

114
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,660
or that one opening that provides
access to the environment,

115
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,020
which ultimately leads to the compromise.

116
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,460
The much harder effort,

117
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,549
and most of your pressure
really exists on the blue team,

118
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,480
where you have to understand
the entire threat landscape,

119
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,930
everything that the
organization is facing,

120
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,010
and contribute effectively
to the incident handling,

121
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,900
or the incident response process,

122
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,870
that includes planning,
containment, eradication, recovery,

123
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,180
and even in some instances,

124
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,240
you're also focusing on
post incidence analysis,

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,500
to make sure that you understand,

126
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,140
how did the attack occur,

127
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,680
so that you update your defenses

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,590
and prevent that attack
from happening again.

129
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,549
This role is much broader in scope,

130
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,210
it requires a lot more effort,

131
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,030
it requires a lot more knowledge

132
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,489
because we're not focusing just

133
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,210
on finding one hole and fixing it,

134
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,180
but we're focused on
understanding all of the holes

135
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,364
that exist within the organization.

136
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,483
This demand and the problem

137
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:46,050
for the blue team is really
the thesis of the conversation,

138
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,670
that you can't have good cyber defenses,

139
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,521
if you don't have good cyber defenders,

140
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,180
and we can't have the
entire security profession,

141
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,040
focus solely on red teams
and penetration testing,

142
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,130
we have to start to invest time,

143
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,580
money, and resources,

144
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,500
in developing the talent,
the knowledge, the skills,

145
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,950
and the capabilities of
the people who are going

146
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,551
to defend our organizations
from cyber attack.

147
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:13,440
Now, when we talk about
managing your defenses,

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,891
again, the red team is not something

149
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,600
that is of limited value,

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,967
but the red team in
context of the organization

151
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,729
and the wider concern is
really what we're focusing on.

152
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,460
Lax cybersecurity practices,

153
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,760
poor patch management,

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,070
all of these things work together

155
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,712
to influence how well,

156
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,420
or how poorly,

157
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,350
your security program is going to function

158
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,090
and the success that you're
going to be able to achieve.

159
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,099
It's apropos that for the Asia
Pacific and Japan conference,

160
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,090
we use the SingHealth
data breach as an example

161
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,150
to talk about what could go wrong,

162
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,522
the findings from this breach
highlight how important it is

163
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:57,030
that the people who work
in the blue team role,

164
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,590
that are defending the organization,

165
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,000
have the right knowledge,

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,910
the right skills,

167
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,490
and the right capabilities,

168
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,940
not only to defend the organization,

169
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,610
but also to respond properly
when an attack happens.

170
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,010
Now this is not
disparaging for SingHealth,

171
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,430
these are just the facts
as they're presented

172
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,240
in the report that was done,

173
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,900
but when the data breach
originally occurred,

174
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,609
the findings that were produced as part

175
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,390
of the after action review,

176
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,159
noted the lapses in security,

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,200
lapses in the control,

178
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,750
lapses in the understanding

179
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,810
of the incident handling process,

180
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,170
and the incident response program
allowed 1.5 million people

181
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,340
in the country of Singapore,

182
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,861
to have their personal
health information exposed

183
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,409
and exfiltrated by the attackers,

184
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,470
this also affected
prescription information

185
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,200
for 160,000 people,

186
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,090
including the prime minister.

187
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,000
A lot of this could have been prevented,

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,540
if you read the report that was generated

189
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,500
and released in January of 2019,

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,740
there were numerous
factors that contributed

191
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,820
to not the data breach itself,

192
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,945
but to the poor response

193
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:11,945
that was in place at the beginning,

194
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,320
well, at the beginning of the evaluation,

195
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,810
you know if we were to take step by step,

196
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,643
what happened,

197
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:18,570
and how did it happen,

198
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,210
and how can we learn from it,

199
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,710
part of the problem was
poor patch management.

200
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,712
Staff, both at a security perspective

201
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,260
and an IT infrastructure perspective,

202
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,730
and within the organization,

203
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,580
fell prey to phishing attacks,

204
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,480
there were weak administrative passwords

205
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,884
and all of the domain expertise,

206
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:38,240
and all of the resources
for incident response,

207
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,030
were at a higher level
of the organization,

208
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,002
they didn't rest withinside
SinghHealth itself.

209
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,620
When you look at the control failures,

210
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,125
incident response personnel,

211
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,285
were unfamiliar with
incident response processes,

212
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:54,684
they were overly dependent
on the government agency

213
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,339
that supported IT for the health sector,

214
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,810
and they failed to understand

215
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,420
and act on the significance of the data

216
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,540
that was provided after it surfaced.

217
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,069
Now, this is not disparaging
again for SingHealth,

218
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,190
this happens in all types of cases,

219
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,580
if you go farther back and
look at the Target data breach

220
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,610
that happened in North
America a few years ago,

221
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,180
the issue was similar.

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,579
You have a third party,

223
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,262
managed system security service provider,

224
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,939
that is doing security monitoring,

225
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,170
is generating reports and is feeding

226
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,430
that information to the organization,

227
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,910
but the volume of the data that exists,

228
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,770
makes it very difficult to identify,

229
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,603
understand,

230
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:36,030
and act properly upon the
findings that are reported.

231
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,069
And so again in this case,

232
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,660
where you have a lot of investment

233
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,719
on the red team,

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,530
the weakness and the failure

235
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,494
and the consequence for the organization,

236
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:47,470
rested more importantly,

237
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,910
on the capabilities of the blue team,

238
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,800
and the people who were
defending the organizations.

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,319
The commission that
conducted the investigation,

240
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
as part of their findings,

241
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,170
one of the statements that stood out

242
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:02,330
and makes a huge difference
in this conversation,

243
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,830
is that even if organizations
delegate work to vendors,

244
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,420
organizations as the data controllers,

245
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,444
must take responsibility
for the personal data

246
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,270
that they've collected
from their customers.

247
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,103
In some cases,

248
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,750
it's going to be customer data,

249
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,610
in other cases,

250
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,460
depending on your organization,

251
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,823
it's going to be corporate secrets,

252
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,720
or other types of information
of significant value,

253
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,620
that make the difference

254
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,580
between success or failure
for the organization,

255
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,780
again, focusing solely
on penetration testing,

256
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,260
and the red team activities,

257
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,293
is not going to equip
you to respond properly.

258
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,400
When you look at the
weaknesses in capability

259
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,420
of the blue team and the defenders,

260
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,339
even at the government sector,

261
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,851
that was responsible
for providing support,

262
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:50,262
the senior cybersecurity manager was fired

263
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:52,739
because he had a mistaken understanding

264
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,400
of what constituted a security incident,

265
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,433
and when an incident should be reported.

266
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:03,540
The report specifically noted,

267
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,089
that this person had a passiveness

268
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,040
that after repeated alerts by his staff,

269
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,530
caused him to miss opportunities

270
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,810
that could have mitigated,

271
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,969
or averted the impact of the attack,

272
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,453
and so we're not saying that excellence

273
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:19,730
in this area would have
stopped the breach,

274
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,720
but we're looking at the
impact of the breach.

275
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,550
There is a lot that you could do

276
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,370
to prevent 1.5 million records worth

277
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,470
of data exfiltration from
happening within the organization,

278
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,570
it's not just finding the weakness,

279
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,160
but it's also responding properly

280
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
when the event is identified.

281
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,880
Similarly, the information
security officer was demoted,

282
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,960
because that person misunderstood

283
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,190
what constituted a security incident,

284
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,952
and that person failed to
comply with established,

285
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:49,160
formally documented,

286
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,480
incident responding procedures.

287
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,430
Richard Magnus,

288
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,979
the chair of the committee on inquiry,

289
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,080
his most significant report,

290
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,000
or the most significant
outcome in the report,

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,062
simply stated that one must not lose sight

292
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,800
of the fact that the treatment

293
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,209
of cybersecurity issues and incidents,

294
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,720
by staff and middle management,

295
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,100
is very much shaped by
organizational culture.

296
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,173
What we have in a lot of
organizations around the country,

297
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:18,280
in the Asia Pacific region,

298
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,839
as well as in North America,

299
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,980
in the Gulf Coast countries,

300
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,690
in Europe and Africa,

301
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,870
regardless of where you go in the world,

302
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,810
a lot of organizations are
spending the bare minimum

303
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,640
to achieve compliance outcomes,

304
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,240
and they're trying to supplement
those compliance outcomes

305
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,670
with penetration testing,

306
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,900
and third party evaluations
of the security controls.

307
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,459
If we're going to move
beyond penetration testing,

308
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,471
it becomes very important
that organizations start

309
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:47,890
to invest in the training,

310
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,449
the professional development,

311
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,600
and the capabilities of their staff,

312
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,220
so that you can avoid situations

313
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,870
where the people who are responsible

314
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,250
for security and incident response,

315
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,980
are ill equipped to handle their duties

316
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,090
and their responsibilities.

317
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,350
The second bullet on the slide
highlights a study from ESG

318
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,980
and the Information Systems
Security Association from 2017,

319
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,490
that said that the
cybersecurity skills shortage,

320
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,780
is exacerbating the
number of data breaches

321
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,540
that are happening globally.

322
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,969
That is a factual statement

323
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,500
that reinforces the theme of this talk.

324
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,200
When you dig into the
report from ESG and ISSA,

325
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,730
you'll find that a lack
of adequate training

326
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,000
for non-employees is
the number one concern,

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,910
where a lack of adequate
cybersecurity staff,

328
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,838
is the second concern.

329
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,177
It takes the conversation,

330
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:41,330
not just beyond penetration testing,

331
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,500
but also beyond just general
security awareness training.

332
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,930
The best thing that cybersecurity
professionals can do

333
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,479
for their organizations,

334
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,580
is make sure that the people

335
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,610
that are supporting the organization,

336
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,176
understand the impact of their actions

337
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,897
on the security posture,

338
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:59,030
they understand the reason
why security is asking them

339
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,459
to do certain things,

340
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,380
for example,

341
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,430
why do I go through phishing training?

342
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,969
The phishing training is not just

343
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,947
to satisfy a compliance requirement,

344
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,840
it's to make sure that end users,

345
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,340
who do not deal with cybersecurity topics

346
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
and concerns on a daily basis,

347
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,260
understand the primary risks
that they're exposed to,

348
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,220
and they understand how they should act,

349
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,900
or how they should respond,

350
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,819
when they see something suspicious.

351
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,106
It is very easy for one person clicking

352
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,185
on one link and an unintended,

353
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:28,920
or unauthorized phishing message,

354
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,740
to cause the entire
infrastructure to be compromised

355
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,440
that ultimately leads
to data exfiltration,

356
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,440
or could lead the entire
organization's infrastructure

357
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,946
to become the victim
of a ransomware attack

358
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,506
that creates an outage,

359
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,810
could put people's livelihoods at risk,

360
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,310
could ultimately cause the business

361
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,089
to shut down and then
everybody loses their jobs.

362
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,200
So the idea of going
beyond penetration testing,

363
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,457
is really shifting us into a conversation

364
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:59,900
about the entire corporate
culture for the organization.

365
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,209
Does the board of directors,

366
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,840
does the CEO, does the CIO,

367
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,510
do all of the executive staff,

368
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,270
do all of the users
within the organization,

369
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,150
understand the risks that
the organization is facing,

370
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,607
and do they understand the role

371
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:15,680
that they all play within the organization

372
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,160
to counteract those risks
and to do something about it.

373
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,540
Your red team is going to
identify all the holes,

374
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,660
but the blue team is going to be the part

375
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,800
of the organization that
generates that understanding,

376
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
that generates that awareness,

377
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,470
and helps people come to the conclusion

378
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,383
about why all of this matters.

379
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,550
Now as we move forward
in the presentation,

380
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,449
there is a focus

381
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,000
on developing the skills
of non-technical employees,

382
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,310
the majority of the
employees in a company,

383
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,420
unless you're a technology company,

384
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,870
or a digital manufacturing company,

385
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,203
most of the people that work
in your organization are going

386
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,487
to be non-technical employees,

387
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:54,579
that probably don't have the same level

388
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,010
of knowledge as your IT staff,

389
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,573
and as your security staff.

390
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,439
A good framework for
building the knowledge,

391
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,273
the skills,

392
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,000
and the capabilities that they have,

393
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,120
to understand the risk and
to respond appropriately,

394
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,830
is going to be a standards based approach.

395
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,233
NIST Special Publication 800-50,

396
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,750
is a great starting point,

397
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,583
one,

398
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,415
because it's free.

399
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,833
and anybody that goes to the
cybersecurity resource center

400
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:26,090
for the National Institute
of Standards and Technology,

401
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,530
found at csrc.nist.go,

402
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,819
can download the document,

403
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,840
they can evaluate it,

404
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,475
they can look at all of the content

405
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:37,310
that is provided to help you
go beyond using a vendor tool,

406
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,410
and start to think about,

407
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,260
how do I really make an
impact for the organization?

408
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,710
Have I identified the role of education

409
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,153
in our process where education seeks

410
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:51,480
to generate longterm understanding,

411
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,010
and a true,

412
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,930
deeply held appreciation

413
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,319
of facts or information?

414
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,820
You know what are we doing for training?

415
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,360
Are we developing new knowledge?

416
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,630
Are we developing new
skills that are going

417
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,970
to equip our non-technical workforce

418
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,859
to understand and recognize,

419
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,760
the cyber threats that they're facing,

420
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,310
and the indicators of compromise

421
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,940
that might be evident on
their computer systems,

422
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,710
whether that's in an email,

423
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,450
whether that's in a screen flickering,

424
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,520
whether that's in some unauthorized,

425
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,450
or inappropriate behavior.

426
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,910
Finally, taking the approach
that's in the NIST document,

427
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,020
is going to help people to
understand the role of awareness,

428
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,460
which is to increase
the perception of facts,

429
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,360
and reinforce everything
that you've learned

430
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,250
in your educational programs,

431
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,858
and to reinforce everything
that you've learned

432
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,100
in your training programs.

433
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
The combination of these three approaches,

434
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,240
as an ongoing activity,

435
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,040
not just once a year for compliance,

436
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,720
but month after month,

437
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,160
year after year,

438
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,120
over the entire existence
of the organization,

439
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,649
is going to develop and
enhance the capability

440
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:56,830
of your non-technology workforce,

441
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,639
of all of those employees
who have business roles,

442
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,210
financial roles, marketing
roles, sales roles,

443
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,790
all of those people are going to start

444
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,840
to develop an appreciation

445
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,510
of what can they do to
protect the organization,

446
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,470
under what circumstances are they going

447
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,130
to notify the security
teams if something is fishy,

448
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,620
and to overcome the
compelling human desire,

449
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,908
to just click on every link

450
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:23,290
in every email that
comes across their desk,

451
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,090
or ends up in their inbox.

452
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,669
As people start to
increase their awareness,

453
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,120
as they start to focus on the greater good

454
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,110
that comes from understanding the risk

455
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,030
and reporting things properly,

456
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,500
the organization is going to be

457
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,710
in a better strategic position

458
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,970
to communicate, express,

459
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,194
and reinforce ideas that
enhance the risk management

460
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:47,530
and the acceptable level of risk,

461
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,430
that's established within the company.

462
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,090
Now, as we dig deeper
into the conversation,

463
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,060
establishing clear objectives

464
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,379
and understanding the methods,

465
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,140
your education, your
training, your awareness,

466
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,960
is going to be very valuable.

467
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,793
You want to make sure

468
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:08,030
that you're tying the education
training and awareness,

469
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,940
to established policies,

470
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,920
that you help people understand their role

471
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,740
and do role based security,

472
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,650
that you help people
understand what to do.

473
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,740
There's a big difference between
having a policy that says,

474
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,280
this is what you must do,

475
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,139
and having reinforcing material that says,

476
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,270
why are you doing this,

477
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,900
and why is it important?

478
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,940
You know you think about things

479
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,770
like changing your password every 90 days,

480
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,230
and having you know,

481
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,015
an eight character
password with upper case,

482
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:36,290
lower case, numbers, and symbols,

483
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,350
that makes sense from a security context,

484
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,990
but to really get people to understand

485
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,200
and to apply and to take
those requirements seriously,

486
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,350
you have to make sure they
understand the reason,

487
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,600
why are we asking you to do this?

488
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,610
The why goes into things like
the susceptibility to attack,

489
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,780
the strength against a brute force attack,

490
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,240
the likelihood of compromise,

491
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,860
the likelihood of password guessing,

492
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,550
most of your non-technical users

493
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,050
within the organization
are very smart people,

494
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,500
and if you take the time to get them

495
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,070
to understand why you're
asking them to do things,

496
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,510
they are more likely to embrace the ideas

497
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,723
and apply those ideas to their work.

498
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm similarly thinking
about the delivery methods,

499
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,740
gamification has been
growing in popularity,

500
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,310
but it's not the only approach,

501
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,550
not everything has to be a webinar,

502
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,060
not everything has to be
computer based training,

503
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,280
taken the time to evaluate and understand,

504
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,138
the makeup of your workforce,

505
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:32,169
how they learn,

506
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,180
what are different delivery models,

507
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,890
do we do a combination of
instructor led sessions,

508
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,809
lectures, town hall
meetings, follow-up emails,

509
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,490
Q and A sessions,

510
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,450
posting things on Slack
or on a public forum

511
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,610
that allows people to ask
questions without shame

512
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,870
and without any kind of
negative consequence,

513
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,060
all of those things are going

514
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,740
to work together to support
a multi-variable approach

515
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,870
that allows everybody to
experience the positive benefits

516
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,193
and the positive outcomes
of your training programs.

517
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,550
Another thing to consider,

518
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,117
is that as you're investing the time,

519
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:13,950
and the energy,

520
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,906
and the resources,

521
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,379
to develop your non-technical workforce,

522
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,540
these people actually have the
opportunity and the ability,

523
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,280
to add to the capabilities
of the blue team.

524
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,870
You imagine a situation where all

525
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,280
of your employees recognize
a phishing attack,

526
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,670
and then they send those
notifications to the blue team,

527
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,900
to the people who're working on defenses,

528
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,530
the blue team can now
start to develop trends,

529
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,210
and understand what's going
on in the environment,

530
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,300
what are people saying?

531
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,740
What are they observing?

532
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,580
And now you've equipped your workforce

533
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,350
to be part of the solution,

534
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,540
rather than simply saying,

535
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,320
the users are the weakest
link in the organization,

536
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,189
and they're just a part of the problem

537
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,453
that you have to manage.

538
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,660
Now the role doesn't,

539
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,940
or the responsibility does not just rest

540
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,100
on the workforce and the end users,

541
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,639
but as we saw in the SingHealth example,

542
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,580
there is a huge responsibility that exists

543
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,817
for the cybersecurity professionals

544
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:09,240
that work in the organization,

545
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,515
And a adequate security team
is going to have a balance

546
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,530
of offensive and defensive capabilities,

547
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,790
this brings to bear or
brings to mind the idea

548
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,740
that your red team and your
blue team are both important,

549
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,810
and they're both going to work together,

550
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,466
their roles satisfy
different requirements.

551
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:29,469
Under normal circumstances,

552
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,804
your attackers know how to
attack broadly using a variety

553
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,985
of tactics, techniques, and procedures,

554
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,449
that allow them

555
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,100
to apply all kinds of
offensive capabilities.

556
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,439
Within your organizations,

557
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,110
if you're increasing the adequacy

558
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,889
of your cybersecurity staff,

559
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,610
you're gonna develop cyber ranges,

560
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,139
you're going to develop
tools and techniques

561
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,720
that allow your team to practice,

562
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400
you're gonna do use cases,

563
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
that allow people to verify

564
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,379
that they have the ability

565
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,220
to identify and respond properly

566
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,053
to the most likely threats

567
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,180
that you're going to face.

568
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,550
This also ties in the idea
of enterprise risk management

569
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,310
and all of your security controls,

570
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,639
where your red team,

571
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,530
your blue team,

572
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,520
and your risk management professionals,

573
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,040
are working in conjunction to ensure

574
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,770
that you understand what
is the susceptibility

575
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,170
to attack that the organization faces,

576
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,350
because of the quality
and the effectiveness

577
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,159
of the controls that you have in place.

578
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,220
This is going to allow
the defenders to focus

579
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,600
on where's the most likely
threat going to come from,

580
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,570
what are the most likely
areas of weakness,

581
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,700
and where am I going
to focus my attention?

582
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,720
Now, as somebody who works
in professional development

583
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,540
for cybersecurity people,

584
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,860
I have a bias,

585
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,240
but I highly encourage the CSOs,

586
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,340
that organizations,

587
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,669
that the CEO,

588
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,830
that the CIO,

589
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,260
anybody who has influence over budget,

590
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,240
should ensure that they invest properly

591
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,130
in the training of the individuals,

592
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,260
not just for the offensive capabilities

593
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,000
and getting certifications like CEH,

594
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,060
but also focusing on the
defensive capabilities,

595
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,800
where you make sure that your defenders,

596
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,725
your managers,

597
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:06,159
and the people who are
leading the development

598
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,840
of your security strategy,

599
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,360
are getting CSO level certifications,

600
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,850
are getting manager level certifications,

601
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,120
that they're learning
how to be good leaders,

602
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,889
so that they respond to events properly,

603
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,360
and that they coordinate
the teams properly.

604
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,590
Similarly, investments in
automation are going to enhance

605
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,879
and extend the capabilities
of your workforce,

606
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,520
so that you shift away from
managing everything manually,

607
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,910
depending on the knowledge,

608
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,880
the wisdom,

609
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,750
and the intuition of a person,

610
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,690
and you start to adopt automated response,

611
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,253
EDR and other tools that are
going to speed up the process,

612
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:44,470
so that the people who are
working on your security team,

613
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,360
are focused primarily on
the novel and unique things,

614
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,490
not spending hundreds of man hours,

615
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,060
going through the same
mundane repeatable process

616
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,637
that you could have leveraged technology

617
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:57,312
to provide an automated response for.

618
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,488
In closing, as we draw near to
the end of the conversation,

619
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:03,480
in the tradition of RSA,

620
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,838
there're always things
that you can apply now

621
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,280
within the short-term
and within the long-term,

622
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,670
so that you can adopt
everything that we've said,

623
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,130
and reap the rewards for
your own organizations.

624
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,963
In the short-term,

625
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:18,320
it's important to remember
that tools are great,

626
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,820
but you can not manage
security without people.

627
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,110
I highly encourage all security leaders

628
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,240
and all organizations
to invest in the people

629
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,620
that they have supporting
the organizations,

630
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,340
remember that people are people first

631
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,320
and they're driven by needs and emotions,

632
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,730
and one of the greatest needs

633
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,330
that you can fulfill for
your security talent,

634
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,899
is to make sure that they're
getting continuing education,

635
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,980
and that they're continuing to learn.

636
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,360
If things become stagnant,

637
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,750
if they become mundane,

638
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,670
if they become uninteresting,

639
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,670
it increases the likelihood
that the critical people

640
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,050
that you're depending
upon on your blue team,

641
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,540
are going to overlook or not notice,

642
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,700
new types of attacks,

643
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,300
new threats that you're facing,

644
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,590
or new incidents that could be occurring.

645
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,423
You also wanna make sure

646
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:01,630
that you develop a balanced security team.

647
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,030
The entire theme of this
conversation is that we need

648
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,780
to go beyond penetration testing,

649
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,940
penetration testing people are important,

650
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,225
but they're not the holy
grail or the silver bullet

651
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:13,159
of your security program,

652
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,510
they're just one component.

653
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,220
When you think about immediate
actions that you can take,

654
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,440
getting to know everybody
in the organization

655
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,060
and what's driving them,

656
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,970
is going to be an important
component for success,

657
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,660
as well as understanding
how the business operates.

658
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,150
A industrial control systems organization,

659
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,230
or manufacturing organization,

660
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,310
is going to face different risks,

661
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,340
and require different types
of security investments,

662
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,810
compared to a financial
services organization,

663
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,909
or an organization

664
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,940
that collects a lot of personally
identifiable information.

665
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,470
As you start to gain traction,

666
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,730
as you start to gain
success with this approach,

667
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,870
you also want to start
to establish metrics

668
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,409
that represent that
things are getting better,

669
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,700
that we're doing a good job,

670
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,800
that our investments are
satisfying the requirements

671
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,373
that we set out to establish.

672
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,210
And then finally,

673
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,100
as part of your long-term plan,

674
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,933
you wanna make sure

675
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,930
that you're investing meaningfully

676
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,520
over a period of time
in your security staff,

677
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,353
you wanna make sure

678
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:13,440
that you're applying
now the cultural shift,

679
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,420
not only to your non-technical
and technical employees,

680
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,990
and to the security team,

681
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,190
but also to your vendors,

682
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,160
to your third parties

683
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,200
and to everybody who has
access to the environment.

684
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,080
The more you can engrain these
strategies into the culture,

685
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,100
and the fabric of the organization,

686
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,169
the more you're gonna have
the ability to reduce risk,

687
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,540
to avoid compromise,

688
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,210
and to respond quickly,

689
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,390
when that incident that
everybody encounters,

690
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,160
actually occurs within the organization.

691
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,350
I thank you for taking
the time to listen to me,

692
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,281
I thank you for being part
of the RSA conference,

693
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,659
the Asia Pacific Japan edition,

694
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,830
and I hope you enjoy the
rest of the sessions.

695
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,883
Thank you very much.
