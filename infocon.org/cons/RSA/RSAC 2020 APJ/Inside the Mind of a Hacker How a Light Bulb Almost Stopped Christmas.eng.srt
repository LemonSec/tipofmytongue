for the presentation.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,510
- Excellent, many thanks
for the introduction.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,860
It's a pleasure to be here
and I'm really excited

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,693
about this session.

12
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:39,390
This is something that
I really enjoy doing.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,920
It's great to be back again with RSA.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,530
It's a pleasure to be speaking with you.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,200
I like to share my experiences,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,180
I'd like to share my knowledge with you.

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,490
And this is really taking
you down a real life,

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,530
world penetration
testing and ethical hack.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,020
And it's really taking you
Inside my mind and thoughts

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,650
of how I think, what am I
actually carrying out, planning

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,250
and preparing to do penetration test.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,480
And this kind of takes
you down this journey

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,360
of how a light bulb
almost stopped Christmas.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,130
So it's really interesting and hopefully,

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,970
it'll be some lessons learned
and eye opener for you.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,803
So let's get started.

27
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,500
Let's take you down this journey.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,880
So first thing is, you know,
my name is Joseph Carson.

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,509
I'm joining you here
from Tallinn, Estonia.

30
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,320
So halfway across the world.

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,649
I'm the Chief Security Scientist,

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,060
a company called Thycotic.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,130
And I've been in industry for a long time,

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,640
more than 25 years of
a multi award winning,

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,350
sophisticated professional,
frequent speaker at events.

36
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,929
Normally in personal life,
last year I did over 80 events

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,380
and more than 100 days on the road,

38
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,710
but this year is very different.

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,919
So, I'm really excited to be
able to have the opportunity

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,410
to do these virtually in digital formats,

41
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,009
which I think is a great
way to continue making sure

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,230
we share the knowledge and
you know, create the community

43
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,100
and that's very important in the industry.

44
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,899
And also been an author
of several books as well.

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
So when I started off in
the industry many years ago,

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,890
one of the things is
that really, you know,

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,710
security for me hasn't
really changed much.

48
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,770
So a lot of the technology
in the way we deliver things

49
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,810
has changed, but security itself

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,220
hasn't really changed much at all.

51
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,020
When I started doing basically, you know,

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,490
working in mainframes
in the early 90s and 91

53
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,380
doing digital transformations,

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,430
and digital transformation
then was really moving

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,510
from paper to computer
records, digital formats,

56
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,380
and security for all that kind
of those types of machines

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,640
and types of infrastructure and data

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,230
was really key to the door.

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,190
That was basically what
protected sense of data

60
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,780
from being abused.

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,790
And it really kind of we, of
course, moved those, you know,

62
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,320
physical keys to digital context.

63
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,829
So we have moved to more
digital locks and keys.

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,810
But the security itself
is really all about

65
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,660
protecting the data,
protecting the sensitivity,

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,850
and making sure it's only available

67
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,239
to those who are authorized.

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,697
So for me, it really hasn't changed,

69
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,610
but the pendulum has
changed the more we do

70
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,740
the compute power, where
we do basically the stories

71
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,950
and how we process things,
but in regards to security,

72
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,880
we really need to evolve,
we really need to adapt

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
to a lot of changing world.

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,250
So, when it gets into, when we
think about, I look at this,

75
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,800
we've really industrialized
a lot of things we do,

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,460
we really talk about the
industrial internet of the IoT,

77
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,293
Internet of Things.

78
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:19,050
And for me, to be honest,
the Internet of Things is,

79
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,890
is what I've always been
doing, is connecting computers

80
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,670
to a network, it's making them
communicate to each other.

81
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,359
And the Internet of Things is basically

82
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,470
just more devices being connected.

83
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,490
And what that really can
be looking at is that

84
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,630
this the devices have changed.

85
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,430
The way they've changed is
really, it's more but you know,

86
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,910
with the computers that I was
programming and deploying,

87
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,210
it could be reprogrammed and repurpose

88
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,043
from different things.

89
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:44,190
One day, it could be an
Active Directory server,

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,450
reprovision to being a database,

91
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,160
the next week provision
to being a web server,

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,710
the next month, so things
could be reprogrammed.

93
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,090
But we're going to talk
about the Internet of Things

94
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,940
as devices become more,
let's say specific,

95
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,240
more single purpose.

96
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,610
They become very very you can
change the purpose of them.

97
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,030
They have very specific
functions and tasks with a ping,

98
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,830
a data collector, a sensor,
a temperature reader.

99
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,220
So Internet of Things is
really just another computer,

100
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,540
but a very specific, and
even humans ourselves,

101
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,570
we get into looking at, we're
wearing a lot of devices,

102
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,579
a lot of wearable devices,
such as health devices,

103
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,859
even your mobile phone in your pocket.

104
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,030
So even humans, we've
just become another sensor

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,010
on the internet.

106
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,969
We've just become another data collector.

107
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,930
While we may not be directly connected,

108
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,170
but a lot of the devices we're
carrying shares that data,

109
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,210
whether it being with web
services, API's gateways,

110
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,310
being correlated, converge
with other people's data,

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,600
and images shared with other
companies are basically

112
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,990
been used to make critical decisions.

113
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,100
So when I look at that, yes, you know,

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,460
the Internet of Things
is basically just another

115
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,200
type of connected device.

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,860
And this is really what
the story is about,

117
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,320
is that as organizations
deploy new devices,

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,849
what risks are those introduced?

119
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,120
So traditional security,
many companies have been

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,020
really you know, doing
that Traditional Perimeter.

121
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,510
And even so today many
companies are looking

122
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,180
at that perimeter defense.

123
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,670
It's about you know, the access
or the transmitting of data

124
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,480
in and out of the organization.

125
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,210
And what really protected
was things around firewalls

126
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,210
and DMZs and, you know,
network perimeter devices, IDSs

127
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,530
and really making but the access
controls to gaining access.

128
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,109
But really, that perimeter
has very fundamental flaws,

129
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,840
is because you're really
looking at basically

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,950
one access point, one
door, the internet point,

131
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,590
and you really can't be sure
is one anyone passive that,

132
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,789
gets authorized and when
they're inside the network,

133
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,880
becomes very difficult to make sure that

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,620
you're not abusing the rights.

135
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,360
And also with cloud mobility,
really blurs those parameters

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,950
because now every human
every person walking

137
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,530
into your office is an
internet access point.

138
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,719
They've got an internet
access point in their pocket

139
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,210
and therefore data can
leave your organization

140
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,030
and very many different kind of aspects

141
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,640
and work different directions.

142
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
And if we look at many
of the data breaches

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,419
are resulting from stolen credentials.

144
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,140
And we even looked at recent
reports that even showed that

145
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,900
even with Cloud Computing,
77% of Cloud Computing,

146
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,010
data breaches were result of
basically credential stuffing.

147
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,690
So this still come away that
attackers use to gain access.

148
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,330
And then of course, the
defenses even myself in my years

149
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,659
of doing network security and
doing things like antivirus,

150
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,090
were the things that
we'd end up looking at

151
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,400
was defense in depth,
(mumbles)security like an onion,

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,130
adding more perimeter
controls, trusted Insider,

153
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,460
doing basically data insecure vaults,

154
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,219
looking at additional DMZs

155
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,420
and multiple segmentation
of those networks,

156
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,220
IDSs, IPSs and even SIEMs.

157
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,270
This meant that we actually
added multiple segmentations

158
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,103
of the network.

159
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:44,470
It could been between layers,
between the internet itself

160
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,970
and the internal private
network, or it could have been

161
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,120
basically segmentation of
things like production,

162
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,850
UAT test environments,
BYOD networks and so forth

163
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,010
to minimize data sharing across
those different sensitive

164
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,630
or even server back end, client front end.

165
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,120
You have different
layers that was actually

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,520
segmenting and protecting
what was really important

167
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,859
to organization.

168
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,450
But attackers got smart,
attackers got really kind of

169
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,200
looking at how we kind of prioritize

170
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,940
and how we did our security.

171
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
And simply what they started doing was,

172
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,330
is rather than going directly to our door

173
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,490
and trying to gain access,
what they did was simply

174
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,240
stealing trusted insiders,
credentials and privileges

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,070
by targeting the people
when they're outside

176
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,099
of the organization and in
their actually social lives.

177
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,580
What they were looking for, was basically

178
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,500
stealing that information
and be able to use that

179
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,450
those usernames or credentials
to basically bypass

180
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,780
all the security controls that
organization put in place.

181
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,299
And this really makes it complicated

182
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,580
because one you basically have
is that the security defenses

183
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,810
are looking for those
untrusted unauthorized users.

184
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,730
And one basically the
attacker puts the coat

185
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,540
or puts the uniform on of an employee,

186
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,900
they look like they should be there.

187
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,530
They look that they
should be in the network.

188
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,280
And therefore security
basically becomes basically

189
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,220
unusable one, basically
authenticated trusted credentials

190
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,080
have been used.

191
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,169
And we really start looking
at things like behavior,

192
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,710
analyzing, and looking at
ways to actually mitigate

193
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,680
and more complicated ways to,
you know, to really defend

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,190
and identify those.

195
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,740
And this becomes a common way,
and ultimately what happens

196
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,810
is the attacker kind of connects us.

197
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,105
So one of the things I recommend,

198
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,250
and this is one of the
reasons for this presentation,

199
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,070
the session today is I
always recommend that

200
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,990
looking at Hacker Techniques,
it's critically important

201
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,260
how cyber criminals target.

202
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,582
There're basically victims.

203
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,500
And it's really important
understand that I myself classify

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,190
myself as a hacker and
majority hackers out there

205
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,533
in the world, they're
actually doing good things.

206
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,919
They're actually helping organizations

207
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,709
and using their skills for good.

208
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,299
And there is those few
hackers out there that really

209
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,689
are the criminals, the ones
that's abusing their actually

210
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,790
skills for a legitimate illegal ways.

211
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,560
But I always say that it's
important to put yourself

212
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,609
in the mind of those, understand about

213
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,160
what's their motivations
and the techniques they use,

214
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,260
because understanding Hacker
Techniques is the best way

215
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,569
to defend, if you know how
they target your organizations,

216
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,850
that's the way that you
can actually make sure

217
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,160
that you can actually reduce
the risk from those areas.

218
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,640
And it's also understanding
and translating those into

219
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,420
business actually risks

220
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,550
is the best way to get security budget.

221
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,109
So let me take you through this journey.

222
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,300
And one of these kind of, interestingly,

223
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,760
this actually penetration
test in my experience,

224
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,120
it all started with pirates, yes, pirates.

225
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,340
And when we think about
pirates, people start to think

226
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,270
about well, okay, you know,
is it's like, you know,

227
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,270
pirates as we see in the
movies, is it the pirates that

228
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,760
you're familiar with them,
you know, the big screen.

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,939
So automatically my tell in this story,

230
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,160
and this experience starts with pirates.

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,201
It started not with
these types of pirates,

232
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:49,100
not with the ones that you think about,

233
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,700
but it started with
these types of pirates.

234
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,240
Then between 2005 and
around 2010 and 2012,

235
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,850
there was a major problem
in the Gulf of Aden

236
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,520
and off the coast of Somalia,

237
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,460
with major piracy operations,
and yes, they were attacking

238
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,470
vessels as they were going basically,

239
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,170
between different trade routes.

240
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,510
They were carrying valuables,
whether being oil, food,

241
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,110
whether being energy,
equipment, medical devices,

242
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,540
all (mumbles) transferred
and logistics going through

243
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,620
the Gulf of Aden.

244
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,660
And really, it became
very very problematic

245
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,770
because a lot of vessels, a
lot of ships got targeted.

246
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,310
And this became a major issue.

247
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,780
And even myself, I worked on
a project around the (mumbles)

248
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,689
same time around GDPR in 2007, 2008,

249
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,020
that a lot of those
discussions were happening.

250
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,699
And we created what was
called as a project called

251
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,740
Looking Glass.

252
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,950
And Looking Glass was a
project in order to give

253
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,870
early warnings to other
vessels about piracy in Iran

254
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,840
so they can share the
intelligence with other vessels

255
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
that the Navy could send in ships

256
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,010
to protect those ships as well.

257
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,300
So this really kind of
started around that time.

258
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,349
And actually, what
happened was, over time,

259
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,260
this Looking Glass project in this early

260
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,900
intelligence sharing, it
really started to reduce

261
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,810
a lot of attacks, a lot of
attacks became less frequent,

262
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,839
we started seeing a reduction,

263
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,320
but then all of a sudden period of time,

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,580
then all of a sudden
the attacks increased,

265
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,890
there was a series of
increase of these piracy

266
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,330
and success of those attacks.

267
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,270
And one thing we realized was
that there was a particular

268
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,970
after analyzing that data,
we find that a particular

269
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,850
shipping management
company that was actually,

270
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,220
became a common area of these attacks,

271
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,610
that became one of the common victims.

272
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,750
And we realized that there was a potential

273
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,050
that they had been compromised.

274
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,510
So one of the challenges
was, is that this particular

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,290
company had a large number
of vessels that was June

276
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,689
is coming up this time is
around September timeframe,

277
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,160
and was coming up that a lot
of these vessels were coming

278
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,180
from Asia than into Europe,
a lot of people's packages

279
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,609
and Christmas presents.

280
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,940
It was coming up a
really busy time of year

281
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,990
and it meant that yes,

282
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,020
people get worried that if
these vessels get targeted,

283
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,510
then the Christmas
presents would not arrive.

284
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,590
So I was contacted and
asked to actually conduct

285
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,970
a penetration test and an ethical hack

286
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,240
for the ship management
company to find out

287
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,300
how they potentially are compromised,

288
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,819
did they have any vulnerabilities,
and what potential things

289
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,560
they could do in order to reduce the risks

290
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,050
to make sure that their ships
couldn't be not targeted,

291
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,880
and they could actually make
sure that they'd be able

292
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,540
to deliver the Christmas presents

293
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,760
that were coming up to the end of year.

294
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,970
So I'm going to take you
on a journey into my mind

295
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,430
and some of the things that I think about

296
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,920
when I'm preparing and planning
and some of the techniques

297
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,890
that I use in order to
gain access to companies.

298
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,020
And one of the things that's
really important to note

299
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,010
is that while I'm sharing details about

300
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,020
a real life penetration
test, it's important that

301
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,110
I'm not allowed to speak
about locations and vendors

302
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,890
and companies in order to
make sure that they're not

303
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,100
disclosing this information.

304
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,970
So, yes I can't afford
to talk about vendors,

305
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,530
I can't talk about the
locations that this occurred,

306
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,600
and the companies that
were involved in this.

307
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,330
So let's take a dive inside my mind

308
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,910
and take you on a journey to think about

309
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,589
how I perform these tests.

310
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,900
So the first thing is in one
of my kind of preparations

311
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,180
is reconnaissance, sometimes known as

312
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,500
the passive assessment,
sometimes known as you know,

313
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,800
basically, the digital footprinting.

314
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,522
And this is the step one,
this is the first thing

315
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:24,210
that we do and this tends to
be actually one of the most

316
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,040
time consuming components
of any penetration test.

317
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,750
It's really about looking
to the organization,

318
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,120
looking at their online digital footprint,

319
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,850
looking at the things that
they use security wise,

320
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,340
looking at what solutions
they've deployed,

321
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,840
looking at their supply chain of vendors,

322
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,850
looking at their jobs, resume, websites

323
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,560
for actually posting for
new people to be hired,

324
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,489
and looking at what types
of skills and technology

325
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,080
they're actually looking to
hire, looking at online videos,

326
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,690
looking at basically
any pictures, any data

327
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,110
that is on the internet that
we can use in order to create

328
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,550
this digital blueprint.

329
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,939
And it's a great way because
when you do really great

330
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,450
digital blueprint of an organization,

331
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,860
it allows you to see the
organizational chart,

332
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,070
it allows you to see the contact details.

333
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,600
It allows you to see every little detail

334
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
about those organizations.

335
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,280
And this is information,
when you do this really well,

336
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,790
it means that the rest of the steps,

337
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,930
this is the first major step.

338
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,000
And we do this really
well, the rest of the steps

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
become very easy, and also
very accelerated to the point

340
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,480
where it can only take
about two to four steps

341
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,360
to gain full access.

342
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,480
So this is one of the
most important phases.

343
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,580
And one things I look at is
that in this step is really

344
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,193
understanding about how to
minimize so if I say, let's say,

345
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,550
I want to be stealthy, as
one of my important areas,

346
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,310
I wanna reduce the cost,
I wanna make it cheap.

347
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,839
And I also have limited
resources, so time is the essence

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,480
of doing it fast but cheap and stealthy,

349
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,260
and also not introducing
anything new as well.

350
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,520
So reconnaissance is one
of those important phases,

351
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,470
and one of the most common
routes that many pentesters

352
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,940
and ethical hackers take
today is using phishing scams,

353
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,340
using social engineering.

354
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,920
It's one of the most
common techniques in sport.

355
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,252
Most cyber criminals are also using.

356
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,030
This's one of the things we
look at is what phishing scams

357
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,839
can be successful.

358
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,203
And one things I've done
numerous times is that

359
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:15,110
in these phishing scams, is
really understanding about

360
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,500
which one's worked well.

361
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,580
And in this particular one
that's been done many times

362
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,070
in the past, is using things
like images and emails.

363
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,380
And it looks like an attachment,
people receive these emails

364
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,970
all the time from looks like
to be a legitimate source,

365
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,180
but really, it's a phishing
scam trying to gain access

366
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,979
to username and password.

367
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,160
And this particular one
is simply by clicking

368
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,780
on the actually attachment.

369
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,250
What it does is it basically
opens up into a page

370
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,740
where you actually, it's
asking for username password.

371
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,290
And this is something that most employees,

372
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,050
most people see commonly.

373
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,060
They'll see an it basically
entered in looks legitimate,

374
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,127
and what they're simply doing
is handing over the username

375
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,199
and password to the attacker.

376
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,730
And this is one of the most
common ways in order to

377
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,780
basically gain one foot in door,

378
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,350
to gain access to organizations.

379
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,080
So, what happens is most
that I've used in the past

380
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,600
similar ones, you know,
it's really looking,

381
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,760
what we're looking for is
asking people for the passwords.

382
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,670
And most common that I've seen,
at least recently been using

383
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,400
some that I've used in the
past myself is things like

384
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,900
speeding tickets, parking
fines, looking things around

385
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,430
health insurance, you know,
even payment information.

386
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,120
And once that's been used
very commonly in recent times,

387
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,940
has been around things like
COVID-19, we've seen an increase

388
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,510
in usage of delivery scams
where people are doing a lot of

389
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,896
online shopping, we've also
seen increasing unsubscribes

390
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:32,930
and IT surveys, and even
one that I've enjoyed using

391
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,699
even myself in the past couple of years

392
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
is bad phishing emails.

393
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,939
These're the emails that
actually when you receive them,

394
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,020
it actually looks like
it's a phishing email.

395
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,750
But at the bottom of the email,
there's a filter that says

396
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,750
this is coming from an external source.

397
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,880
It looks like a phishing scam.

398
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,570
We will request you to report
this here on security team

399
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,940
in order for further analysis.

400
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,190
You know, click here to
report this phishing scam,

401
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,100
but actually the click here
and that subtitle in the email

402
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,370
is the scam itself.

403
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,940
So really looking to views
that new security tools

404
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,030
and security techniques in
order to abuse people's trust.

405
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,290
And these are some of the most
common thing that happens.

406
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,270
And what you're really
doing phishing scams

407
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,040
is abusing the time, that
urgency to do something

408
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,430
immediately, to make sure
that there's a fear element,

409
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,550
and money and going back to the one before

410
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,290
using things like speeding tickets,

411
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,250
speeding tickets, I've done
one and the government agency

412
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,210
were basically one of the
requests was can I do 100% success

413
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,020
and by doing speeding tickets,
issued the speeding tickets

414
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,350
5:30pm on a Friday afternoon.

415
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,500
And what happened was that basically,

416
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,950
it meant that if they tried to contact

417
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,570
the Transportation Agency, it's closed.

418
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,540
So when we go from Monday
to Friday, nine to five,

419
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,159
so they can't verify it.

420
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,670
And also meant basically
people wanted to get home they,

421
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,370
people do things in order to finish work

422
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,830
and get home quickly.

423
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,129
And it meant there was a
fear of being illegal as well

424
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,780
because it was a speeding ticket.

425
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,389
And what happens is
that they didn't verify

426
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,600
and accept they may acknowledge
this speeding ticket.

427
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,730
In 24 hours, it will
actually double the fine.

428
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,430
So this impact of money.

429
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,360
So by Monday morning, 99% of
the people actually clicked on

430
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,689
that link, 99% success.

431
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,414
And automate people's jobs.

432
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:17,260
People's jobs in many cases
is to click on things.

433
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,310
So, we want to know what the
one person didn't click on,

434
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,340
an ultimate it was the one
person who actually didn't

435
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,919
look at their email till Monday.

436
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,140
So sometimes it was important
to understand why people

437
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,580
don't click on things.

438
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,550
So as I was preparing for this
pick the tickler penetration

439
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,246
tests on a ship management
company, one of the things that

440
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,400
kind of realize was that
we were going to use

441
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,470
a similar technique.

442
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,150
We had already prepared
a phishing campaign.

443
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,270
There was a team that was on a location

444
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,760
close to the actually the headquarters

445
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,280
of the ship management company,
we'd rent an apartment.

446
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,600
We'd set up our techniques,
we set up our lab,

447
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,760
all the things of like gathering
intelligence information.

448
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
It was all in preparation

449
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,591
and everything was going to plan,

450
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:01,360
everything was all ready to be launched.

451
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
And the campaign was set.

452
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,860
Then one of the team members,
that was a pretty new member

453
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,909
of the team of the red team decided that

454
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,780
it would be actually okay
to do a perimeter walk.

455
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,470
To walk around basically, the
actual office of the target.

456
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,130
And at that time, basically we were doing

457
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,730
this is person was coming from university

458
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,940
and doing the thesis.

459
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,490
And the thesis was on
basically radios and GPS.

460
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,400
And one of the things we actually
were using playing around

461
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
at the time with software defined radios,

462
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,790
and simply just losing
those radios together,

463
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,370
information together,
data about the target

464
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,679
of what Wi-Fi signals, what
Bluetooth information to see,

465
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,260
what Wi-Fi hotspots, what
devices or GPS phone signals

466
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,500
and stuff, and really kind
of understanding about

467
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,333
what devices they had.

468
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:50,550
So we agreed okay, before we
do the actual campaign start,

469
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,080
let's take that basically that you know,

470
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,929
SDR let's do a walk around
and let's collect a bit

471
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,418
more information before
we launch the campaign.

472
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:03,199
So after basically, during that
walk basically had backpack,

473
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,150
antennas, a couple of Raspberry Pi's,

474
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,090
some software defined radios,
walking around the perimeter

475
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,590
and collecting everything that
transmitted a radio signal

476
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,100
from that office.

477
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,780
And when we get back to the lab,

478
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,450
and we started analyzing the data,

479
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,550
we started looking through
all that's a printer,

480
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,411
that's a laptop, that's
a Wi-Fi access point.

481
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:24,930
So we started basically doing
what was our digital blueprint

482
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,560
heat map of where those
devices potentially were

483
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,100
in this office.

484
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
But one thing was interesting.

485
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,889
One thing that was very
very kind of surprising was

486
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,860
that all of a sudden, we
saw a MAC address that kept

487
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,270
repeating and over and over
again, the same MAC address.

488
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,370
And we got very curious to
what that MAC address was,

489
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,639
what was actually what was
this device that we're seeing

490
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,160
that was using the same MAC address?

491
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,880
Sometimes I find it easy it
was, you know, network devices

492
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,980
or, you know, things from the same vendor.

493
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,060
But what was very
interesting to learn was that

494
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,290
this device that came
back was a light bulb.

495
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,720
And we got very curious because
it was something that we had

496
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,170
never came across before.

497
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,640
It was something that was
actually the first time

498
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,770
that we see during this test.

499
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,120
And out of all many
penetration tests before

500
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,709
we then decided, you know,
can we actually abuse this?

501
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,640
Can we abuse the light bulb?

502
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,100
So one of the things
we did was, of course,

503
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,937
we got the MAC address,
we did reverse lookups,

504
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:21,110
we actually looked at which
vendor was the manufacturer,

505
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,610
what software, what
known valnabilities were,

506
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,570
how could we get our hands on them,

507
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,240
and ultimate decided to
hold the phishing campaign.

508
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
And let's see if we can use the
light bulb as an alternative

509
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,930
means because phishing campaigns
sometimes are very noisy.

510
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,520
If you get one employee, he's
very willing to speak or alarm

511
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,220
or the IT teams, you
know, be able to monitor

512
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,330
those phishing campaigns,
you can actually be end game

513
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,230
obviously lose the success
of that very very quickly

514
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,590
as somebody speaks, or somebody shares

515
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,500
with the security team, and
they can actually prevent you

516
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,880
from gaining access.

517
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,280
So we decided to switch from
doing the phishing campaign

518
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,100
to doing actually abusing the light bulb.

519
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,929
So what ended up happening
was, we decided okay,

520
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,610
we talked and we
purchased the light bulbs,

521
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,510
we did some tests,

522
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,250
and we find it with some
known vulnerabilities.

523
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,950
And ultimately, were able
to find that we can actually

524
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,040
piggyback off light bulbs,
and even use a Raspberry Pi

525
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,129
to pretend that we were light
bulb, in order to gain access

526
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,550
to the network, we actually
used a light bulb in order to

527
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,409
get one foot in the door

528
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,680
of the organization's Wi-Fi network.

529
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,990
So, this is one of the
kind of interesting kind of

530
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,520
composed was that we were able to pretend

531
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,410
to be a light bulb and
also hijack the light bulbs

532
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,490
with Wi-Fi access by
actually being able to find

533
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,337
the actual password that
was actually been used

534
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:39,520
(mumbles) some of the weak
or no one Wi-Fi protocols.

535
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,090
So this allowed us to actually pretend

536
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,590
and disguise ourselves not as
a user, not as an employee,

537
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,000
not as a username password
and Active Directory account

538
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,410
and a laptop but actually as a light bulb,

539
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,280
and we were actually be able
to then able to look around

540
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,399
and start actually exploring
the IT environment.

541
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,370
Split exploring what else
devices were around us.

542
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,570
So you get into what you
known as promiscuous mode

543
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,610
where we really start to
understand what devices do I see,

544
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,909
what traffic, what
protocols are they using.

545
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,140
So sometimes one of the
things that many people assume

546
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,600
that, you know, we talked
about, and a lot of cases,

547
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,669
that network scanning, use
a lot of off the shelf tools

548
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,100
or things like Kali Linux,
there's end map and so forth.

549
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,330
And there's Metasploit
and those tools are great

550
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,163
and they're fantastic,

551
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:27,560
they're great for, you know,
doing a lot of attacks.

552
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,419
But one thing I prefer to do
before actually moving to using

553
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,270
those tools, is actually
living off the land.

554
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,700
Using the tools that the customers have.

555
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,890
So looking at what Remote
Desktop Software they're using,

556
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,510
looking at what software
delivery components they use,

557
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,310
looking at really kind of
what scanning tools they have,

558
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,010
do they have vulnerability
scanners and network.

559
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,640
So really looking at what
the tools are available to me

560
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,730
before I decided to bring
any of my own things.

561
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,670
And so yes, these tools
are used quite frequently

562
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,540
and quite often, but
most of us prefer to use

563
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,830
the tools that you find lying around

564
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,320
in the customers environment.

565
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,100
And as we were doing discovery,
what we end up finding

566
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,399
was that as we were connected
to the Wi-Fi network,

567
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,250
we end up seeing that this actual network

568
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,530
is not the actual production.

569
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,180
It's not the one that we
wanted to gain access to.

570
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,790
It was actually a guest network.

571
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,580
It was the guest network, it
was one they allow their guests

572
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,179
to connect to in order to
gain access to the internet.

573
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,050
It was things like conference rooms,

574
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:27,879
we find presenting equipment
like desktop computers and TVs

575
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,090
and other types of devices
that allow you to share

576
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,030
and be able to present,

577
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,410
so it was where their vendors came into.

578
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,970
And we were able to actually
find a desktop that actually

579
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,310
had not been patched.

580
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,169
It was a desktop connected
to a PC that actually had

581
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,600
basically unpatched and
actually contained also

582
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,969
a lot of vendors presentations,
financial information,

583
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,660
information that had been
sitting on the device

584
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,270
for more than four years.

585
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,440
These devices have been
the ones that thought

586
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,910
they're not secure than built.

587
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,800
They're not the ones used often.

588
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,180
They're the ones that
we don't need to patch.

589
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,880
So the things that are just
used for you know, functional,

590
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,980
just things to present on TVs.

591
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,930
But in many cases, people
plug USB devices into,

592
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,660
they actually upload their presentations

593
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,410
and their spreadsheets
and their documents.

594
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,780
And they leave them there,
they don't clean it up.

595
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,850
And also, it's not important
so they don't patch it.

596
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,889
So ultimately be able to then
get access to that device

597
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,370
and be able to look around
to be able to start observing

598
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,090
and finding more information
about what types of software

599
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,350
they're using, what types of
controls and security products

600
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,183
they're using.

601
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:31,410
So really starting to look at,
how can I elevate privileges?

602
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,260
How can I gain access to
the keys of the kingdom

603
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,720
in order to basically make
sure that we can get further

604
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,190
into the network.

605
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,450
And one of the things we find
was that in a conference room,

606
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,870
what happens?

607
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,209
Meetings, people come
into the conference room,

608
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,797
sit down to connect their laptops,

609
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,420
and where do they
connect their laptops to?

610
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,960
The Guest Wi-Fi network.

611
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,430
So very very quickly, we find
that actually as meetings

612
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,960
were happening in that room,

613
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,200
that they actually people
rather than connected

614
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,530
to the corporate network,
got firewalls and protected

615
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,930
and limitations and also
sometimes didn't allow them

616
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,750
to access certain websites
for things like social media

617
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,460
or personal side, the actual guest network

618
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,620
allowed them to do that,
so they switched over.

619
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,040
And one thing we ended up finding was

620
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,270
the local administrator password
of the presentation system

621
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,248
that we were on, was the same
local administrator password

622
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:25,360
as their corporate laptops
along a specific jump

623
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,659
from one to the other, and
the selling Remote Access Tool

624
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,640
that allowed us specifically
when that person in the moving

625
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,460
and disconnecting from
the meeting and going back

626
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,760
into their desk, it allowed
us to elevate privileges.

627
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,879
So that's one of the easy
things and within four steps

628
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,940
with already full access to network,

629
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,040
that allowed us to maintain access.

630
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,154
So when they took that laptop
across the domain network,

631
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,930
it actually made a call
home, allowing us basically

632
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,590
to reconnect back into the device.

633
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,169
Now from our point, we're
basically looking at how we can

634
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,940
maintain and gain access,

635
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,520
and then report the things that we find.

636
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,110
If it was a malicious actor,

637
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,669
of course, they're looking to
conduct malicious activity.

638
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,740
And ultimately what a
malicious actor is trying to do

639
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,110
is cover their tracks.

640
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,070
They're really looking at how
they can hide their tracks,

641
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,560
and get out very very quickly
and ultimately, basically,

642
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,409
you don't even know they were there.

643
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,650
So in many cases, they do
things like misdirection.

644
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,730
And I've even seen ransomware cases,

645
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,220
being a result of attackers
hiding their tracks,

646
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,690
hiding the fact that they
stole data from organizations.

647
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,900
So one of the things that I
find more time enough is that

648
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,230
for many organizations, a
password is sometimes only thing

649
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,930
that's protecting your
business from cyber criminals.

650
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,980
And even if it was a light
bulb, it means that yes,

651
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,590
we have to make sure that
we're actually doing more than

652
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,679
just passwords, that
we're actually minimizing,

653
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,700
that we're creating unique
passwords for every system,

654
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,760
every login,

655
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,460
that we're not reusing over
and time and time again,

656
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,850
make it difficult for
me to perform my job.

657
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,939
And ultimately this
gets to my point is that

658
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,080
not only is it just a password protecting,

659
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,090
but also we have to actually
change the way we view

660
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,230
cybersecurity.

661
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,740
Cybersecurity is not my job.

662
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,500
Cybersecurity is my skills.

663
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,130
My job is to use my cybersecurity skills

664
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,540
to help organizations reduce risk,

665
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,490
to help actually be a business focus.

666
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,300
So everything from those
light bulbs being installed,

667
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,720
they should have actually
had a risk assessment done

668
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,380
into knowing how to patch
them, how to secure them,

669
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,030
how to keep them updated.

670
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,200
And ultimately, the key takeaways
from this is the lessons

671
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,030
that I learned and hopefully
that you will learn

672
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,350
from this real life penetration
test against a light bulb

673
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,010
is that a risk assessment should be done

674
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,480
for all IoT devices.

675
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,210
And it should be focused
around the actual functionality

676
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,950
of what that device actually does,

677
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,470
and what its purpose is.

678
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,450
The criticality segmentation
of networks is critical.

679
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,160
Those light bulbs need
to be in the same network

680
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,610
as the Wi-Fi access,
patching systems and updating

681
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,530
all systems, updating, make
sure you actually secure them,

682
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,800
patch them, because even if
it's a presentation machine,

683
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,913
that could be me getting
one foot in the door.

684
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,230
And again, strong, unique passwords,

685
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,000
don't have every single
password been the same.

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,980
That allows me to jump from
machine to machine to machine.

687
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,920
And again, business and people centric,

688
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,040
create a cybersecurity culture.

689
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,930
The more that you actually
create people being

690
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,840
frontline support, frontline detectors,

691
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,530
the more difficult it is
for me to be successful.

692
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,920
I hope this has been
information informative for you,

693
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,520
hope it's been educational, and
somewhat maybe entertaining.

694
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,420
But again it's been a pleasure,
I hope to see you again

695
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,570
in person and or maybe
future digital events.

696
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,790
So again, thank you for RSA for having me,

697
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,639
love being able to share my experience.

698
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,830
And again, stay safe, stay secure,

699
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,860
and be safe on the internet.

700
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,693
Thank you.
