10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,980
I'd now like to turn it
over to Soumen Bhattacharya

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,373
and Dr. Lynette Qu for the presentation.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,740
- Yeah.

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,199
Hello and welcome.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,970
And we feel

15
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,170
extremely delighted and excited

16
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,250
to present our approach
to Zero Trust architecture

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,253
in front of this esteemed audience.

18
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,460
And with that being said,

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,009
I'll kick off our presentation.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,810
So we call our Zero Trust
approach CARE model.

21
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,330
And it's about delivering an achievable

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,853
and a risk appropriate design,

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,210
commensurate with the
different constraints

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,229
that your companies may be having.

25
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,060
This be with your budget constraints,

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,430
your resource constraints,

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,820
your timeline constraints,

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,690
your existing legacy
infrastructure constraints

29
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,330
and running business constraints.

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,260
So it's effort on

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,359
having an incremental
approach to Zero Trust

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,660
and a practical approach while
promoting a very engaging

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,773
and delightful user experience.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,480
So which the same concept
gives us our acronym,

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
we're in the healthcare business.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,250
It's Conditional Access
Responsible Enforcement.

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,563
That's our CARE model.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,280
I wanted to take a peek on the

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,280
some of the reference
materials that we consulted

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,299
in guiding us for our Zero
Trust architecture approach.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,750
And at the forefront,

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,720
we had the privilege of consulting

43
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,560
the originator of the Wolrd Zero Trust

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,020
John kindervag from Forrester

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,000
and it was a privilege
to get his consultation.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,780
Other model is the
Gartner CARTA Framework.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,000
And another model that we consulted was

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,100
the Google BeyondCorp.

49
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,470
This is a very good reference material.

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,880
It has a set of five white papers

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,130
which give quite valuable information.

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,950
And some other model that we consulted

53
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,980
is Netflix Lisa model.

54
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,350
And and there is a NIST
publication SP 800207.

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,390
So I'd encourage the audience

56
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,339
to consider this reference points

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,320
for valuable guidance for Zero Trust.

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,160
So this is overarching view of
our CARE architecture model.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,950
And on the left you see

60
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,359
an overlay of our design
principles that guide us.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,310
So I will try to explain
this as an example.

62
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,840
Our user is sitting in a coffee shop

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,750
trying to access a resource
which is in the database.

64
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,320
So his attempt to access is intercepted

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,760
by our policy enforcement point,

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,899
which consults our policy decision point

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,780
which is our central
decision making engine

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,840
based on our central
decision making principle.

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,883
And our decision point,

70
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,640
is in the business of crafting

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,159
intelligent conditional access policies

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,930
to inform the authentication

73
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,600
and decision the authentication.

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
So in doing so it consults on the right,

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,560
it consults the asset information

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,340
which goes towards the good
object events principle,

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,390
the device health information,

78
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,960
the user trust score,

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,799
which is based on his historical behaviors

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,780
and the analytics and
insight feedback systems

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,440
which is based on different IDS/IPS tools,

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,130
SCIM tools,

83
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,820
different other feedback
tools that we have.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,719
And we use that to make our policies

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,390
more responsive and intelligent

86
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,370
to account for all the threat vectors

87
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,060
and threat intelligence
that we can tap into.

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,440
So with that,

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,560
we made the judicious judgment

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,850
that whether we should throw

91
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,980
an adaptive authentication on the user,

92
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,300
like an MFA challenge or a capture

93
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,410
or just let him authenticate as usual

94
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,363
and then once he's authenticated,

95
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,050
we channel that authentication
to point of authorization.

96
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,930
Authorization routed,

97
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,640
we deploy the authorization
enforcement point

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,693
as close to the target
resource as possible.

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,280
So that's close to the object

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,092
and it consults our
centralized decision point.

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,850
And makes a decision on the authorization.

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,050
So once an authorization
is given our object

103
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,200
is under practice it's deployed

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,370
in a software defined
network's micro segment,

105
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,200
which is logically grouped
as per the object grouping.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,378
So this is our overarching
architecture principle,

107
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,428
very simplified view.

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,370
I will unpack our CARE model

109
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,423
and discuss different
tenets that we have here.

110
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,289
And building blocks for
use and the learning

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,820
that we had in our incremental journey.

112
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,670
So firstly identity is the foundation

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,530
(mumbles)

114
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,369
and people are your trust universe.

115
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,920
So finally it is for the
people worse than you do this

116
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,480
to provide a risk appropriate design

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,827
experience to the people.

118
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,600
By identity foundation
how do we strengthen that?

119
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,820
So unified directory and
unified access decisioning.

120
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,200
So oftentimes in legacy companies

121
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,650
or in big enterprise companies we see

122
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,960
a fragmented identity repositories

123
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,404
and a fragmented identities

124
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:01,219
which we have you right our
core productive directory,

125
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,610
corporate HR systems,

126
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,110
corporate LDAPs,

127
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,040
corporate databases.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,260
And this fragmented identity leak

129
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,099
needs a lot of fragmented
integration points

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,710
and painful maintenance,

131
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,430
a lot of other programs.

132
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,280
So our recommendation to
consolidate your directories

133
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,190
to have a true dry free approach

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,340
and which basically
consolidates everything

135
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,190
and then you can offer
a true single sign on

136
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,520
based on routing your authentication

137
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,152
to the appropriate identity.

138
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,320
And with that a consolidated directory,

139
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,911
you can open it up using the LDAP,

140
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:46,744
SCIM and the REST

141
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:50,113
and SQL protocols for your
applications and services.

142
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,070
So we want to extend our unified concepts

143
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,740
to even include the policies

144
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,330
and so policies need to be globe

145
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,020
we make it global to account for all

146
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,620
the policies that exist in
your enterprise universe,

147
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,870
authentication and authorization policies,

148
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,250
your network access control policies,

149
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,440
your administration plain policies

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,610
and have a global and
centralized management

151
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,650
and have a model of flexibility in that

152
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,690
so that you can have
different granularity in that

153
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,840
and also you can take into account

154
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,039
different contextual aspects

155
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,799
like the subject, the device,
the location, the network

156
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,829
and the target which
would be the application,

157
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,070
the server, the service

158
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:46,800
when the access is being attempted at.

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,632
So that

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,550
would that be another aspect

161
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,140
and we already have talked
about intelligent policies

162
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,670
and the aspect is oftentimes
in your identity network

163
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
you have privilege creep

164
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,014
and lot of unused privileges

165
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:05,620
and entitlements.

166
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,750
So you need to have a
good governance program

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,650
to plug that hole.

168
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,689
And yeah basically build
automation for your feedback

169
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,330
and threat intelligence systems

170
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,420
and promote centralized
monitoring so that you can detect

171
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,927
anomalous behavior in real time

172
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,090
and also craft some
intelligence and feedback

173
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,990
into your conditional access policies.

174
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,690
So when you detect the anomalies,

175
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,180
so with that being said once
we have consolidated identity,

176
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,363
consolidated policy management,

177
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,010
we are in place to have a
flexible access management.

178
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,590
So once you have like
you detect anomalies,

179
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,120
you make a judicious call

180
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,070
based on your conditional access policies.

181
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,553
That these are the true
positives and then,

182
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,882
through stronger authentication
like a multi-factor,

183
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,300
deal with offering diverse means

184
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,423
and all or a capture or
a step of authentication.

185
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,610
And on a

186
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,210
holistic policy-based access management,

187
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,210
you want to rope in

188
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,000
your privilege access management as well.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,860
And our privilege access
management you have to

190
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,810
handle with special care.

191
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,912
So bring best practices from that like

192
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:28,150
credential vaulting,

193
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,730
session recording, dual accounts,

194
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,050
supervision and monitoring and audit

195
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,882
and so forth.

196
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,699
So with this consolidated identity,

197
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,970
policy and access management,

198
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,130
you can open this up

199
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,870
to offer different identity
and access protocols

200
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,170
for your applications and services

201
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,002
like SAML,

202
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,890
open auth work,

203
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,742
open ID connect and REST,

204
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:57,963
REST APIs and EAPs that we have used.

205
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,839
So this is a consolidation
and summarization of

206
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,323
what we just talked.

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,930
In our current state or
in our previous state,

208
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,930
what we had built based on
different legacy constraints,

209
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,120
different products that we
had from a different time

210
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,090
and different other integration to support

211
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,270
our normal learning business

212
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,340
and how we know we have
an improved form factor.

213
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,110
So we had different limitations

214
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,540
in our operation management

215
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,969
and in our identity management.

216
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,820
So what we have now

217
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,760
as opposed to disparate directories

218
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,430
we've consolidated directories

219
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,290
in a cloud based virtual directory

220
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,199
and with that we are offering

221
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,430
a standard authentication schemes

222
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:56,160
which bodes well for the application

223
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,980
and the services universe consumption.

224
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,740
With that foundation we are able to offer

225
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,270
judicious and adaptive MFA.

226
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,270
And so that we can enable
access from anywhere.

227
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,589
And what we've seen is our legacy apps

228
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,310
that which were custom built and on prem

229
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,410
and had been very nuanced

230
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,170
and specific authentication
and authorization schemes.

231
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,760
We were able to modernize
it and move them on

232
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,230
or migrate them into a
cloud infrastructure.

233
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,833
We were able to solve our,

234
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,910
we had a diverse set of
active directory groups,

235
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,010
who're ready to consolidate

236
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,090
normalize them and make
them centrally administered

237
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,720
and which helped us.

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,670
So fragmented.

239
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,800
What we've seen is fragmented identities

240
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,050
and fragmented like the groups

241
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,890
lead to a fragmented policy management

242
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,800
and challenges in your authorization.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,060
So this let,

244
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,420
centralizing our
administrative groups let us

245
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,439
have a better authorization management

246
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,440
and a better way to launch our
conditional access policies.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,920
Lastly, as I said we were,

248
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,020
we made some automation in our feedback

249
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,829
and threat intelligence systems.

250
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,170
So we could actively
monitor user behavior,

251
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,790
take close to real time action

252
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,590
and also use that feedback to take in

253
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,110
or have more intelligent
conditional access policies.

254
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,270
So that's the end of my presentation,

255
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,069
I will hand over to my
colleague and co-panelists

256
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,440
Dr. Lynette Qu

257
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,990
to take us through the remaining
part of the presentation.

258
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:46,000
- Thanks Soumen.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,850
So Soumen has discussed about
how to build a foundation.

260
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,920
So now let's continue the journey

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,939
of unpacking our CARE model.

262
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,070
In this session,

263
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,340
we'll discuss how to
build a trust boundary

264
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,870
and how to enforce the
policies around the boundaries.

265
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,710
Let's talk about the confined
trust boundary first.

266
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,620
Historically, the shield
against cybercrime

267
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,230
has revolved against strengthening
a network's perimeter,

268
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,570
in attempt to keep attackers out.

269
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,790
The model itself does not really

270
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,730
take into the account of
attacker killer chain,

271
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,260
and the complexity of a
modern network across from

272
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,380
on premises, cloud and hybrid environment.

273
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,530
And also does not really
provide sufficient protection

274
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,339
by leaving the attack surface

275
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,090
that allow the attackers
to remain undetected

276
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,720
and leave the organization vulnerable.

277
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,570
So here we're introducing our CARE model

278
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,363
which is to have confined
trust as the boundary.

279
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,720
With a confined trust,

280
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,140
we can create logical segregation
of the entire network.

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,550
And we can tailor our security settings

282
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,000
to different types of
traffic by creating policies

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,960
that limit network and application
flows between workloads

284
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,100
to those that are explicitly permitted.

285
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,330
So in this model,

286
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,063
we could set up a policy for example,

287
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,000
data to allow databases server

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,600
can only talk to other database servers.

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,520
And if a device or workload ever moves,

290
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
the security policies and attributes

291
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,240
move with it accordingly.

292
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,300
And that's how policy
becomes the boundary.

293
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,010
The goal is to decrease
the network attack surface

294
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,380
by applying segmentation rules

295
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,730
down all the way to
workload our application.

296
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,800
By doing so,

297
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,990
we can reduce the risk of attacker moving

298
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,850
from one compromised workload
or application to another.

299
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,800
And another driver is
operational efficiency.

300
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,060
Because ACLs and firewall policies,

301
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,689
they can introduce a lot
of management overhead.

302
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,140
So making policies difficult to scale

303
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,372
in a rapidly changing environment.

304
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,060
However, one of the big challenge

305
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,719
is who's defining trust boundary

306
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,520
is you have to know what's your segment.

307
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,449
Because the effectiveness of
the model depends on heavily

308
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,523
on the correct implementation
of the trust boundary.

309
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,470
Okay so after we define
the trust boundary,

310
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,910
how are we gonna enforce
the policies, right?

311
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,490
Because at the end of the day,

312
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,090
it is the resource that
we're protecting matters.

313
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,090
In a traditional model,

314
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,380
enforcement is typically manifested

315
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,870
as a single proxy
firewall or load balancer.

316
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,110
In CARE model,

317
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,070
we're introducing attached
enforcement proxy.

318
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,810
Because we realized

319
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,650
the placement of the enforcement component

320
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,970
is very important.

321
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,270
Since it represent control point,

322
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,439
we must ensure the enforcement components

323
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,780
are placed as close to
the resource as possible.

324
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,569
Otherwise, the trust can pull

325
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,550
behind the enforcement components

326
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,469
which undermines the
entire trust security model

327
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,693
we're introducing here.

328
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,460
So the primary responsibilities
of the enforcement proxy

329
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,490
is to interact with our
unified decision engine

330
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,800
to continuously collect
the decision intelligence

331
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,369
in order to make ongoing
enforcement of the decision

332
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,760
and whether servers would
be permitted or not.

333
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
The beauty of our CARE model

334
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,130
is to follow one of our design principle

335
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,230
which is to be mindful of dark defaults.

336
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,490
What this means is

337
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,640
while we implement these
privilege policies,

338
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,829
auto policies will be
implemented and tested vigorously

339
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,550
to maintain user experience

340
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,423
without adding any burden
to the organization.

341
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
So now let's look at examples.

342
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,340
So this is like previous versus now

343
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,669
after we started to implement
our Zero Trust model.

344
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,883
So previously just like most of you,

345
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,370
in your organization you have
a very flat and open network.

346
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,389
And you don't really know
where all of your assets are,

347
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,550
with very limited and
patchy asset awareness

348
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,840
and we tend to have a lot of redundant

349
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,669
and a large amount of network policy,

350
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,490
which results in a very
loose network access control.

351
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,100
And the users typically

352
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,892
will access to your networks through VPNs.

353
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,470
Through a decentralized and
inconsistent enforcement

354
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,880
because you have your
various security controls

355
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,063
all over the place.

356
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,629
Everybody is moving to the cloud,

357
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,716
we tend to have very undetected

358
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:32,550
and ungoverned shadow IT environment.

359
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,543
Also the user can access from
non-managed device as well.

360
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,770
With this Zero Trust
model we're proposing,

361
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,400
we're able to create a
more segmented network

362
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
and we are able to have a more
completed asset inventory,

363
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,770
meaning we are aware of all
the assets in our environment.

364
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,110
And we can start to implement
more granular network policies

365
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,790
which will result in a localized
network access control.

366
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,480
So the user can access it from anywhere

367
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,760
with a protected internet exposure.

368
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,379
In the meantime it will only
allow sanctioned applications

369
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,524
and manage the device.

370
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:19,033
We've also improved our
network monitoring experience.

371
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,699
Okay, so now let's talk
about the last category

372
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,853
of our CARE model which is people.

373
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,409
Did you know the cause of
nearly 69% of data breaches

374
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,290
is employees within the organization?

375
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,120
That is a pretty big number, right?

376
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,050
So we consider people at
the center of the universe

377
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,790
in CARE model.

378
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,870
There are three things to keep in mind

379
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,610
when we talk about people.

380
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,340
The first one is the data

381
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,340
which is basically a data
associated to the employees.

382
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,600
The second one is engagement,

383
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,510
which is how employees
engage with security.

384
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,870
And the last one is a trust profile,

385
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,110
which reflects the security risk

386
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,199
associated to each employee profile.

387
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,300
So let's dive deeper into
each of these aspects.

388
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,750
Let's start with data first.

389
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,380
What you wanna do is

390
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,960
to have a centralized enormous data lake

391
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,900
to store these from different
IT systems in one place.

392
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,900
In that way is easily available
for access decision engine.

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,440
And you also wanna collect
behavior technology

394
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,650
and physical proximity
data from your IT system

395
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,990
because that's what you will
need for access policies.

396
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,400
And whenever you build or buy IT system,

397
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,200
you wanna make sure they can
feed data into the data lake

398
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,190
either by APIs or any
other type of integration.

399
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,090
So now, once you have all the
security data for employees,

400
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,639
the question is how can you use this data

401
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,170
to engage with the employees

402
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,393
to improve their security posture?

403
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,639
So that's where we wanna start
to build engagement portal

404
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,823
for the employees.

405
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,830
The security engagement portal

406
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,740
provides actionable info to employee

407
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,340
based on their profiles,

408
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,199
their roles and other factors

409
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,350
to improve their security posture.

410
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,530
So the engagement portal created
a very nice feedback loop

411
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,860
from employees to IT to
keep the inventory updated.

412
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,679
This resulted in a more
accurate access decisions.

413
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,380
And the overall goal of
our engagement portal

414
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,700
is to provide employee
a single pane of glass

415
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,360
reflecting their security posture.

416
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,149
We wanna make sure

417
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,070
people to engage with
security via this portal

418
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,929
and taking necessary actions

419
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,960
to improve their security posture.

420
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,170
Therefore, we are going to introduce

421
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,800
confidence score here

422
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,010
to which represents a cyber risk

423
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,980
of each employee based on their behavior

424
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,903
and how they engage with security.

425
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,960
So this confidence score

426
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,450
has a somewhat same
purpose as a credit score.

427
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,640
In CARE model,

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,290
we use a static data points
along with the confidence score

429
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,080
to allow or deny access
to protected resources.

430
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,960
And it's very critical
for our access policies,

431
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,530
as in enables us to do
responsible enforcement.

432
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,910
To summarize,

433
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,700
this confidence score
will encourage people

434
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,680
to take actions whenever it needed

435
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,270
to improve their trust profile

436
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,000
and improve their overall security posture

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,433
of the overall organization.

438
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,190
Okay so if you guys have tried to

439
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,969
achieve this Zero Trust model,

440
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,180
you know it's not an easy journey, right?

441
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,900
It's not something you can
achieve in the next month

442
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,020
or even next year.

443
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,993
So in order to reach your end state,

444
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:02,760
what we propose is to take a walk,

445
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,230
crawl and run approach.

446
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,650
So what we meant is during the walk phase,

447
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,940
you wanna start with,

448
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,230
understand your environment.

449
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,740
Which means to identify where
your critical assets are

450
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,190
and understand your data flows,

451
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,680
understand your current
network technology.

452
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,130
And in the meantime,

453
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,060
because identity is such
a critical component,

454
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,409
you wanna evaluate your
identity and access control.

455
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,380
At the end of the day

456
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,450
you always wanna make sure

457
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,480
you align with your business objectives.

458
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,800
And then as you move to the crawl phase,

459
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,430
that's when you can start to

460
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,900
architect your Zero Trust model.

461
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,200
You always wanna start small, right.

462
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,670
With like a one small
component in your environment,

463
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,010
tend to pick something
that is not very critical.

464
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,379
And then you can start to

465
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,830
create your segmentation security policies

466
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,879
and by unifying identity
and access management

467
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,947
as what Soumen mentioned
in the earlier slides.

468
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:05,139
And in the meantime,

469
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,140
you can start to focus
on the people component

470
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,390
that we talked about which is
to build this trust, right.

471
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,160
To start to build this confidence score

472
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,150
and the build this engagement portal.

473
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,450
And then you can move to the run state.

474
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,170
The run state is when you start to scale

475
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,840
the Zero Trust to the
entire enterprise level.

476
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,949
So you can start to apply your context

477
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,510
or risk-based access control policies

478
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,440
and start to enforce the
segmentation security policies

479
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,100
you created during the crawl phase.

480
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,070
And start to verify the trust you build

481
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,149
during the crawl phase as well, right.

482
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,930
So you can start to
decide whether a user can

483
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,917
access a certain resources based on

484
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,830
the trust score they generated.

485
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,483
And always that you ensure to
have secure communications,

486
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,029
have a Microsoft-based design.

487
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,170
And of course the important part is

488
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,653
always implement continuous
logging and monitoring.

489
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,650
So at the end of the day
you wanna reach to end state

490
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,640
which is to have the right
people with the right device

491
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,050
in the right context.

492
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,639
Have the right level of
access to the right resources

493
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,000
through secure communication
that is monitored continuously.

494
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,930
Yeah if you have any kind of question

495
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,000
feel free to ask in our slider.

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,473
This would be a good time to ask.

497
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,520
Okay so we've introduced
you with this model

498
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,990
and you gonna wonder.

499
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,470
Okay so when I walk out of this talk,

500
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,603
what are the takeaways, right?

501
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,939
We would recommend
immediately like next week,

502
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,933
the most important thing is to

503
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,180
understand your current state, right.

504
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,020
To understand your
current network topology

505
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,470
and start to identify your critical assets

506
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,730
and start to take the steps

507
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,170
we identified in the crawl state.

508
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,390
And also you wanna make sure

509
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,770
identify your distributed identity

510
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,050
and distributed access policy stores.

511
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,909
And then as you move to
your first three months,

512
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,950
and then you can start to considering

513
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,590
unify your identity and
policy store, right.

514
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,220
And then block all the insecure protocols

515
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,400
and start to segment your environment

516
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,067
and start to build this
trust score mechanism

517
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,367
that we discussed earlier.

518
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,100
And then within six months
you can start to adopt

519
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,969
your localized and
responsive policy design

520
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,870
and start to provide
this risk-based access

521
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,602
based on a real time employee
score that you build earlier.

522
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,460
So that is the end of our presentation.

523
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,160
Feel free to leave your
comments and questions

524
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,980
and you can reach us

525
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,710
