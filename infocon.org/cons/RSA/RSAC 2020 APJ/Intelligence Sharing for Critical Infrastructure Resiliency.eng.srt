18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,610
I'd now like to turn it over to John Lee

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,683
for the presentation.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,490
- Hi, good morning from Singapore.

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,220
Today, My part will be
on information sharing

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,440
and how we can use it

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,750
to increase the resilience of
our critical infrastructure.

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,800
As we know, we live in a
digital connected world

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,130
and also amid suspend dynamics.

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,699
We also share our information
in our daily lives,

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,040
and in business as well.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,180
So governments and military have done so

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,640
for the longest time.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
So intelligence sharing is crucial.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,320
It helps us to confirm our hypothesis

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,630
and act in a certain manner

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,060
that we can protect our interests

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,410
and further our objectives.

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,740
So there are three topics I like to cover.

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,949
I will start with operational technology

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,880
and explain why this is
important to ensure its security.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,770
Next, I'll talk about the
importance of using best practices

39
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,700
and a structured approach to
secure operational technology

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,480
and ending of a case discussion

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,063
on information and intelligence sharing.

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,613
So operational technology
as defined by Ghana.

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,880
These are the hardware and software

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,190
that the techs have caused a
change to the direct monitoring

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,050
and control of physical
devices, processes,

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,510
and events in the enterprise.

47
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,329
They keep our industrial
processes from running,

48
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,070
such as (indistinct) and power
stations, smart factories,

49
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,010
building automation, systems,
oil and gas installations,

50
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,120
healthcare, transportation,

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,450
our baggage handling
systems at the airport,

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,673
water treatment plants, and many more.

53
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,720
OT or operational
technology is the technology

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,770
that interfaces with our physical world.

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,820
And that includes ICS or
Industrial Control Systems,

56
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,269
Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition or SCADA

57
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,530
and distributed control systems.

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,660
Now ICS comprises of computers,

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,590
both mechanical electrical
devices that perform automated

60
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,130
or send automated control
of equipment in industries.

61
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,380
And these are used by
critical infrastructure

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,500
to control its operations.

63
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,750
ICS have embedded cyber
devices that operate

64
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,920
the industrial processes.

65
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,339
So example, a boiler as a sensor

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,900
that controls the temperature

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,630
to prevent overheating in the plant.

68
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,780
So the sensor is linked
to a computing device

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,280
for monitoring and control.

70
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,320
So at the moment it takes
a rise in temperature,

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,709
you will take steps.

72
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,943
The safety systems will
turn off the boiler.

73
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,760
So another example of
operational technology

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,250
is our ships at sea, where
before the navigation

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,280
was using manual chats.

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,860
But now GPS electronic charts are used

77
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:47,773
to control the navigation
or the route of the ships.

78
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,130
So therefore it cannot be overemphasized

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,650
this extreme importance
of critical infrastructure

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,180
that they keep on going

81
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,230
as they provide services to the country,

82
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,820
our industry that feeds our economy

83
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,630
and ensure that our daily lives continue

84
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,003
to have the basic needs.

85
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,799
So the impact of a breach
to critical infrastructure

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,280
can disrupt our lives
and cause physical harm

87
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,750
to our citizens and impact
our financial systems

88
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,733
and the economy.

89
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,560
So this is a diagram of
the interconnected world

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,820
in Industrial Control Systems.

91
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,090
So in the seventies and eighties,

92
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,520
ICS or industrial control
systems are at get,

93
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,680
they are not connected to the internet.

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,690
That's you don't find a
cyber breach that often.

95
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,323
So a security breaches
are to physical means.

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,130
OT systems, that back
then were built to be safe

97
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,210
and reliable with the
required functionality.

98
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,729
But we are seeing more
and more interconnectivity

99
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,400
from the 1990s.

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,010
So with the integration of IT components,

101
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,219
this allows the ICS or industrial devices

102
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,460
to leverage software, to drive
data collection and analysis

103
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,590
resulting in smarter machines.

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,510
But the flip side is that
vulnerabilities are introduced.

105
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,159
Malicious actors can use the ID network

106
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,020
to gain access to critical OT assets.

107
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,299
Security was not a concern in the past

108
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,370
due to the separation of
the ID and OT network,

109
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,070
but it has become an
increasing concern now

110
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,030
because of the numerous
breaches that have happened

111
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,150
in the last few years,
in the last 10 years.

112
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,020
So in 2014, a German
Steel Mill, a cyber attack

113
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,500
or cookware adversaries
use spear phishing tactics

114
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,760
to capture user credentials.

115
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,719
So the captured credentials was used

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,120
to connect to the OT network
to the business or IT systems.

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,090
So massive damage was caused

118
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,440
resulting in the blast
furnace being shut down.

119
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,630
So some of the attacks on
critical infrastructure,

120
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,310
they include the Iranian Nuclear Plant

121
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,230
that was infected by a malware

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,880
that specifically targeted
a brand of equipment

123
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,110
that was being used by the facility.

124
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,620
And that impact was that PLC's
and connected centrifuges

125
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,063
were destroyed by setting
back their nuclear program.

126
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,409
So another example in 2012,

127
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,940
a targeted malware was used in an attack

128
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,050
on the Saudi National Oil Company.

129
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,890
The wiper malware, infected
30,000 workstations

130
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,409
and deleted the files rendering

131
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,003
the workstations nonfunctional.

132
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,540
So another target included
Ukrainian Power Grid

133
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,860
happened in 2015, spear
phishing emails was used

134
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,400
to load the malicious payload

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,820
known as the black energy malware.

136
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,159
The SCADA system was compromised
and IT infrastructure

137
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,430
systems was destroyed

138
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,190
that by impacting more than 200,000 homes

139
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,550
who were left without any electricity.

140
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,020
So imagine if that happened in our country

141
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,849
so that will have a
disastrous consequences.

142
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,390
So in 2016, another blackout
occurred in the same country

143
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,640
likely to be caused by
the same perpetrators.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,100
So another example in 2017,

145
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,360
that impacts safety
instrumentation systems

146
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,630
of a Saudi Petrochemical
Plant, which was the target.

147
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,240
And that caused the plant to shut down.

148
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,130
So that hackers are learning
and adapting their methods

149
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,540
to target critical infrastructure.

150
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,650
They are using sophisticated
methods and tools.

151
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,440
According to MITRE,
there are 94 APT groups

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,750
that were largely responsible

153
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,743
for all the high profile attacks.

154
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:40,257
There was an alert recently
this year by the Cybersecurity

155
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:43,470
and Infrastructure
Security Agency, or CISA

156
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,900
about Natural Gas Facility in the U.S.

157
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,400
that was hit by ransomware.

158
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,570
The delivery of the payload
was though an attachment

159
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,790
from a spear phishing email.

160
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,770
So the ransomware payload
costs a loss of availability

161
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,990
on the OT assets such as the HMI,

162
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,340
Historian, Polling Servers.

163
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,140
As the data, the OT
network could not be read

164
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,493
or aggregated from these devices.

165
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:11,120
It led to a loss of visibility
by the human operators.

166
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,693
So this led to a two day
shutdown of the plant.

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,950
So another example of a tech
on critical infrastructure,

168
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,950
Israel Water Facilities suffered
a cyber attack this April.

169
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,919
So six plants were targeted.

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,940
Data was wipe out, and one
of the plant had to shut down

171
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,250
because the pump was compromised.

172
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,740
So the danger here is if the adversary

173
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,669
could compromise the systems

174
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,400
that control the level of
chlorine added to the water,

175
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,890
it could let the poisoning
of the consumers.

176
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,120
So cyber attacks on
critical infrastructure

177
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,863
is one of the means that
nation state actors,

178
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,480
they will use this to soften the target

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,363
and pave the way for further
attacks that may follow.

180
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,750
So in a survey by
Ponemon Institute in 2019

181
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,780
out of 701 respondents.

182
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,709
So OT, cybersecurity is lagging behind

183
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,723
its enterprise ID counterpart.

184
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,730
90% have suffered at least one
attack in the past two years,

185
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,990
60% are concerned that an attack
against the infrastructure

186
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,290
would have huge impact of operations.

187
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,290
And 62% mentioned a set
identification, both OT, and IT

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,940
is important.

189
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,720
So OT asses are crucial,
and its protection

190
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,570
needs to be prioritized.

191
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,090
80% felt that sharing threat
intelligence is important

192
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,263
as this will help increase resiliency.

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,600
So I'm going to cover this model,

194
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,240
the Cyber Security Maturity Model

195
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,510
from the department of energy.

196
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,700
So given the vulnerabilities
that we've just heard

197
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,420
and the maturity level OT operators,

198
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,520
which is lagging behind the enterprise IT.

199
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
The very first step we need to do is

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,100
to understand the areas that organization,

201
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,390
your organization needs to focus on

202
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,983
to protect the infrastructure.

203
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,290
So objective of using this
model is to do an assessment,

204
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,910
to identify the current
state of the OT security

205
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,930
and the gap will be the difference between

206
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,819
where you need to be
and its current state.

207
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,090
So in order to achieve that future state,

208
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,790
you need to have the capabilities

209
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,550
and these are defined using the
model to do your assessment.

210
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,319
And the value of such
a model is a framework

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,683
that many models out there.

212
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,310
So one of the benefits of using this model

213
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,973
is sharing of best
practices and information.

214
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,420
You can benchmark against
other organizations

215
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,680
within your sector

216
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,390
strengthening your
organization capabilities

217
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,500
with the assessment.

218
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,960
You know the areas that
are weak and managing risks

219
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,690
by prioritizing areas
that you need to focus on

220
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,590
in order to achieve your future state.

221
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,280
So the assessment is done and involves

222
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,329
evaluating 10 domains.

223
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,800
So the domains presented
on the left hand side,

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,979
risk management, asset
change and configuration,

225
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,720
identity and access control,

226
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,780
threat and authority management,
situational awareness,

227
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,260
event and incident response,
supply chain, the dependencies,

228
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,770
workforce management,
cybersecurity architecture

229
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,663
and cybersecurity program management.

230
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,520
So in the assessment each of
the domains where objectives

231
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,340
and practices related to the objectives.

232
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,540
So the evaluation or assessment
will be on the practices

233
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,400
that are currently being
performed in the organization.

234
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,810
So the practice will determine

235
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,979
the current maturity indicator level

236
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,670
for each objective within the domain.

237
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,280
So for example, threat
authority domain objective two

238
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,660
has given their, a practice
D is being performed

239
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,140
in the organization, which
means a tread profile

240
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,380
for the function is established

241
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,330
that current practice characterize
this potential tractors,

242
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,650
motives intent capabilities, and targets.

243
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,223
So in order to achieve a
practice, the maturity level,

244
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,760
the organization need to
meet the prior practice

245
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,593
such A, B and C,

246
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:25,130
which is identifying internal external

247
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,260
sources of threat intelligence, gathering,

248
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,500
and interpretation of
the strategy information

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,610
and implementing controls
to counter threats

250
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,423
at different levels among
relevant to the organization.

251
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,260
So the model will determine
the level of preparedness

252
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
of the critical infrastructure

253
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,630
in dealing with the OT IT threats.

254
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,130
So it is a framework for critical
infrastructure protection.

255
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,870
So it is also important to recognize

256
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,570
that there's no silver bullet,

257
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,290
but this is one of the ways

258
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,843
to increase OT cyber resilience.

259
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,080
So this example is the assessment

260
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,833
for the risk domain is risk 1D,

261
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,980
so that refers to objective
one and practice D.

262
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,420
Practice D is managers,

263
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,550
objective one is managed
cybersecurity, practice D,

264
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,713
that risk are recorded in a risk register.

265
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,670
So as with the threat example,

266
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,920
which I gave in the previous slide,

267
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,339
to attain practice D,
preceding practices A, B, and C

268
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,970
you need to be fulfilled,

269
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,070
which is you need to identify cyber risks

270
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,180
and document down the risks.

271
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,483
Risks are mitigated, accepted,
avoided, or transferred,

272
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,490
and you need to have
regular risk assessments

273
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,963
performed to identify risks.

274
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,449
So we know that legacy operational
technologies is insecure.

275
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,790
So in recent years, more
and more manufacturers

276
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,380
are working to include security elements,

277
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,250
given the increasing
connection to and use of

278
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,883
IT technologies in OT to drive
performance and productivity.

279
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,467
So to secure operational technology,

280
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,210
there are two things that are needed.

281
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,780
First, you need to access the
current industrial systems

282
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,439
operating environment,
understand the gaps.

283
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,480
And so we discussed the
C2 M2 maturity model.

284
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,920
So using that model allows
you to identify focus areas,

285
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,949
to help prioritize this remediation.

286
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,280
Second sharing, or receiving
threat intelligence,

287
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,410
both internal and external
helps in increasing maturity

288
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,130
and managing risks.

289
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,920
So I will touch on some of
the vulnerabilities of ICS

290
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,479
and covered intelligence cycle

291
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,380
before going into the case discussion.

292
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,040
So in our research by ABI in
2019 on utility cybersecurity,

293
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,256
it was mentioned that by 2023,

294
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,441
connected utility
infrastructure will double.

295
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,985
So the increased connectivity will expose

296
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,730
the companies to cyber threats.

297
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,809
So industrial IOT devices,
such as smart meters,

298
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:00,170
great your energy efficiency
management systems

299
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,829
will be used.

300
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,670
So this digital transformation will see

301
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,660
many other critical infrastructure sectors

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,920
adopt technologies as well.

303
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,910
So that enables smart infrastructure

304
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,400
due to increasing competition
and changing consumer needs.

305
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,390
So some of the vulnerabilities
that we are seeing

306
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,930
are poor design of the OT infrastructure.

307
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,630
So these do not consider security.

308
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,800
It is needed to have a
security architecture

309
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,729
and OT environments because
the landscape is diverse.

310
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,770
There are multiple vendors,
equipment, and devices,

311
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,579
each running, they are
proprietary protocols.

312
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,510
So having architecture view
will help decision makers,

313
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,050
understand the trade off in
making architectural choices

314
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,810
that will impact security and allow

315
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,319
you to implement controls,

316
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,820
to compensate for the lack
of the security design.

317
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,369
So initially the OT that works with safe

318
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,710
due to physical separation,
but you cannot assume that,

319
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,980
given the digital transformation.

320
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,100
So it's best to say, get the ICS networks

321
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,973
into enterprise zone,
control zone and field zone.

322
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,980
And strong boundaries must be
established between the zones.

323
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,670
So this allegation of the
network in the OT infrastructure

324
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,313
allows a follows the
principles of defense in that.

325
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,660
So industrial control system
protocols are also not secure.

326
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,410
So they are used for
connecting devices and systems

327
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,280
amongst the different vendors,

328
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,730
such as a generic HMI solution
can connect to a Siemens

329
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,090
or Rockwell automation PLC.

330
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,070
So from a security perspective,

331
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,570
these protocols also unencrypted

332
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,970
and they do not have integrity checking.

333
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,590
So which leave them open to
replay and manipulation attacks.

334
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,750
And it makes it very dangerous

335
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,230
because more and more of these
systems are getting connected

336
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,560
to the internet and they're
available via the internet,

337
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,583
via modem for the vendor
to provide remote support.

338
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,980
So another vulnerabilities
that ICS management.

339
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,630
So it's important because most
of these, we see the IP wall,

340
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,650
they have good control systems

341
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,599
in identity access management,

342
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,560
but not so for in the ICS world.

343
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,230
So it's important to
prevent unauthorized users

344
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,420
from assessing trusted systems

345
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,790
and preventing your authorized users

346
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,079
from making unauthorized transactions,

347
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,273
whether intentional or unintentional.

348
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,440
So another vulnerability we are seeing

349
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,250
is devices in the field zones
have weak authentication,

350
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,070
and this runs into danger of adversaries

351
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,700
that can do it many that the mean attack.

352
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,600
So we are seeing that due
to industry 4.0 automation

353
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,919
will increase and brings
more interconnectivity

354
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,680
between the IT and OT networks.

355
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,700
So it's important now to take steps

356
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,700
to secure your industrial
network and your applications.

357
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,399
So most of the networks are designed

358
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,889
following the Purdue Model Architecture.

359
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,620
So this was developed
second industrial networks.

360
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,132
So it's one of the good
OT cybersecurity practice.

361
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,633
So the field zone is
where level zero and one,

362
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,340
and contains physical processes

363
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,990
and devices that are used for sensing

364
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,300
and manipulating the physical processes.

365
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,280
So you will find censors
analyzers actuators in this zone.

366
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,267
So the timeframe for
connection is in terms of

367
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:37,260
milliseconds to seconds, and
IT cybersecurity solutions

368
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,003
rarely ever apply in this zone.

369
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,940
So control zones are level two and three.

370
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,850
So what these systems
such as SCADA, HMI, DCS,

371
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,480
and the timeframe is in minutes.

372
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,460
Manufacturing operations
systems at level three manage

373
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,993
the production flow to
produce the desired products.

374
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,270
Requirements for control zone emphasizes,

375
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,920
safety and reliability.

376
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,000
And these devices in this zone
are not updated frequently

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,820
because the network in OT
you cannot stop a process

378
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,740
from the operations will be impacted

379
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,830
if you stop the process to update.

380
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,899
So few cyber security
solutions from the IT world

381
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,640
can be used in this zone.

382
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,620
So level four is the
enterprise or IT zone.

383
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,750
And these where the
business systems manage

384
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,160
the business related activities

385
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,610
for the industrial operation.

386
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,371
Since IT solutions do not
really apply to OT network.

387
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,877
There's often a lack of
visibility in the OT network,

388
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,600
and that can pose challenges.

389
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,010
You cannot protect what you don't see.

390
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,600
So of late, they are good OT
network monitoring solutions

391
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,669
that can identify the
assets of OT network.

392
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,640
This will help OT operators
to assess the threats

393
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,850
and vulnerabilities of the connector,

394
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,830
assess the are being identified,
using the C2M2 framework

395
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,080
that we discussed before.

396
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,149
So next I'll touch on
intelligence sharing,

397
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,400
before going into the case discussion.

398
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,950
So intelligence, as we know is important,

399
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,360
we can help the organization
to detect, protect,

400
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,453
and respond to threats.

401
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:19,910
There are two cycles that
I'll cover or two models,

402
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,160
the intelligence cycle
and the F3EAD cycle.

403
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,830
And I will sum it up because

404
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,300
both can inter operate together.

405
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,447
So generally you have
intelligence requirements

406
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,590
and the strategy that it
could an operational level.

407
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,399
So the strategy element looks at,

408
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,430
who is targeting your organization

409
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,500
and why they are targeting
your organization.

410
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,183
And also where these
threats are coming from.

411
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,657
The tactical alignment looks
at details of the threat

412
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,342
and the timing that these
threats are executed.

413
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,530
So operational expects a
look at how the threats

414
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,923
can reach your target.

415
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,320
So the important thing is
that threat intelligence

416
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,970
must be actionable so that it can increase

417
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,700
cybersecurity executed.

418
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,620
So the intelligence cycle
starts with mission.

419
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,270
So planning is setting the
direction to achieve the mission

420
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,870
is your first step.

421
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,810
And that includes identifying
intelligence requirements

422
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,100
based on your needs.

423
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,023
So data is collected
next from their sources.

424
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,720
This includes acquiring
provisioning of the information

425
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,120
to be used in the next step.

426
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,480
Collected information is
that converted into a format

427
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,313
that you can use, or the
analyst can use for processing.

428
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,290
And a next step is the
production of the machine

429
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,040
involves analyzing,
evaluating, interpreting,

430
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,950
and integrating all the information

431
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,020
that you collect into Finnish
Intelligence Products,

432
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
which is disseminated to the consequence

433
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,153
or to your stakeholders.

434
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,690
So this cycle F3EAD is used by military

435
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,730
and organizations.

436
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,850
So it's an alternative to
the intelligence cycle.

437
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,173
It combines operations and intelligence.

438
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,150
The first three steps are operations,

439
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,483
and last three steps
are intelligence phase.

440
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,870
So getting actionable
intelligence from the partners

441
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,250
and peers can help your
security operations find, fix,

442
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,790
and finish the incidents.

443
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,690
So if a threat is found,

444
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,766
the organization needs
to respond to the threat.

445
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,780
There should also be
playbooks to deal with known

446
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,110
and unknown threats.

447
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,490
Solution deployed is to ensure that

448
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,300
the threat is remediated.

449
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,159
So this is the operation phase.

450
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,713
So following this phase
is the intelligence phase.

451
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,570
So this is where
information can be exploited

452
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,970
and analyze for utilization
by the community.

453
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,450
So information collected from the incident

454
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,650
will be enrich so that it's contextualized

455
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,620
and maybe shared with the wider
community and stakeholders.

456
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,270
Intelligence requirements
can be strategic,

457
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,389
tactical and operational,

458
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,585
and combining both the intelligence cycle

459
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,725
and the F3EAD cycle covers
the three categories

460
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,538
of threat intelligence.

461
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,920
So threat intelligence
needs to deliver value.

462
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,300
That's the most important thing.

463
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,580
So it must be contextualized
to your tactical profile.

464
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,020
So every organization has a check profile.

465
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,083
So we talk about the strategic
tactical and operations,

466
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,910
needs of the organization.

467
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,960
So articulation of the impact
of the threat to the consumer

468
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,308
or to you as a consumer, the
intelligence is important.

469
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,230
So it will help you in decision making

470
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,370
and assessment of the
risks from the perspective

471
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,293
of the organization.

472
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,490
So to sum up good threat intelligence

473
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,890
can help organizations prevent,
detect and respond better

474
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,097
when the threat occurs.

475
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,410
And a recommended action to
take is just as important,

476
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,203
if not the most important.

477
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,950
End this with a case discussion
on intelligence sharing,

478
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,953
in the ISAC or the Information
Sharing Analysis Center.

479
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,350
So there are various
sources of information

480
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,750
they share with both the OT-ISAC.

481
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,780
So the analyst will take this information

482
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,670
and contextualize it into
relevant intelligence.

483
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,690
And the information can be from
public and private sources,

484
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,040
government sets threat intel
vendors, dark webs regulators

485
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,690
and other partners also share information

486
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,960
about incidents and vulnerabilities.

487
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,930
So member sharing is important

488
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,840
because they provide use cases

489
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,429
for the other companies within the sector.

490
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,250
So members can create forums
for further threat discussion.

491
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,550
Request For Intelligence or
RFI may be created by members

492
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,120
to request the OT-ISAC analysts
for further information.

493
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,122
So this can be general or
prioritize intelligence.

494
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,370
GRF supports up to 10 ISACs and ISAOs

495
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,450
and cross sector sharing

496
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,663
also helps to paint the overall picture.

497
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,149
So OT-ISAC members are provided
access to a secure portal,

498
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,530
and it can be assessed to the
web browser or the mobile app.

499
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,100
And members participate in events,

500
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,070
such as bookshops, training and seminars

501
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,450
to share best practices
and receive information

502
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,570
on OT and IP security
threats that are relevant

503
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,483
to their sector.

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,330
So OT-ISAC analysts also
conduct monthly track calls

505
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,970
for its members, and they
talk about topics of interest

506
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,580
to the members.

507
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,800
As soon as we see
feedback from the members,

508
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,889
because I think that is
the most important thing

509
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,410
to have a vibrant
communication between the ISACs

510
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,470
or between the analysts and the members

511
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,030
so that members can bring
out the areas of concern

512
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,220
that they see in their OT environment.

513
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,750
And they must also engage in
discussions among themselves.

514
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,970
Sharing of threat information is following

515
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,080
the traffic light protocol.

516
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,929
and TLP red is where sharing on the call.

517
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,060
Information shared cannot leave the group

518
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,250
that is shared with and
TLP Amber is for sharing

519
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,780
between the parties on the call

520
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,220
can be shared with members
of the organization

521
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,970
or service providers that are helping them

522
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,070
with the OT security, but
not outside this group.

523
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,550
So to TLP green is sharing
with the OT-ISAC community

524
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,600
at large.

525
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,572
TLP white is sharing with the public.

526
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,669
So next I'll run through the OT-ISAC

527
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,460
incident sharing process.

528
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,320
So the entire process can be completed

529
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,419
within one or two days,

530
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,630
depending on the
criticality of the threat.

531
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,190
So members that receive
early warning of the threats

532
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,180
can take the necessary
action to protect themselves.

533
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,050
So it starts with a
member sharing information

534
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,960
about an incident or
threat with the OT-ISAC.

535
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,270
So that may include details
of the incident TTPs and IOC.

536
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,950
The information shared is vetted

537
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,940
by our entities contextualize anonymize

538
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,130
no attributions will be made to the member

539
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,440
who shed that incident.

540
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,890
As the details are anonymize.

541
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,250
The analyst may contact,
the member who share

542
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,240
the information to collect more details

543
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
or clarify the incidents.

544
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,600
So as you can see that the incidents,

545
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,550
the information they shared
is carefully vetted because,

546
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,322
we do not want to spread
false information.

547
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,410
And intelligence really that is vetted

548
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,530
is then disseminated to
the OT-ISAC community.

549
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,403
So if relevant to the GRF
cross sectors community.

550
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,500
So next I will talk about
what are threat intelligence?

551
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,180
So this is the pyramid of
pain that was introduced

552
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,990
by David Bianco in 2013.

553
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,920
So he measures the usefulness
of threat intelligence,

554
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,280
and he lists out the top
indicators that are shared.

555
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,710
So from bottom to top, it
also defines the effort

556
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,060
of the adversary to change the tactics.

557
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,360
So for instance, your hash
values and IP addresses

558
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,310
at the bottom.

559
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,340
So these are easy for the adapter,

560
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,350
for the adversary to adapt and change

561
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,219
to deceive the defenders.

562
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,710
So you block the IP
address that's malicious.

563
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,623
The attackers can also
spoof another IP address.

564
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,670
And as we go up the chain,

565
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,547
it becomes more and more
difficult for the adversary

566
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:19,380
to adapt and change their methods.

567
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,370
Domain names use by adversaries
also at an active life

568
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,760
before they are discovered
and blocked by the defenders.

569
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
So the higher up the pyramid,

570
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,940
it becomes harder for
the adversary to adapt.

571
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,230
So you blogger tools
even force the attacker

572
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,960
to look for another causing
amount of pain to them.

573
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,170
At the top of the pyramid is
the TTPs tactics, techniques,

574
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,140
and procedures.

575
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,880
So these are the behavior
of the attackers.

576
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,430
So we detect and block the
TTPs used by the attacker.

577
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,950
You force the adversary
to modify their methods

578
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,783
and behavior.

579
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:52,229
So this is the most effective.

580
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,830
Of the ISAC members can
share any of these indicators

581
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,280
together with the details of the incident

582
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,263
impact information actions
taken and mitigation strategies.

583
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,040
So at end of a case study
is example of a incident

584
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,990
shared by a member of the ISAC.

585
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,210
So a member reported an
incident that was uncovered

586
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,810
during a security assessment
of the infrastructure.

587
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,919
So internal server,
there was not authorized

588
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,723
to external communication
was found trying to do so.

589
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,980
So further analysis was done.

590
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,470
And a compromised application
on the server was discovered.

591
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,620
So that application, was
trying to send a beacon

592
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,969
from the infector server to an attacker

593
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,080
command and control of C2 machine.

594
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,310
So this is a common
attack used by adversaries

595
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,669
who installed Trojan
on the victim's machine

596
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,940
were called back to the C2 server

597
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,290
that would distribute
the malicious payload,

598
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,600
which can be malware or ransomware

599
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,129
and drop it on the
machines of the victims.

600
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,560
So in this case, the attack was stopped

601
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,879
and the compromised application
was stopped, was cleaned.

602
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,050
So MITRE attack tactic
use command and control.

603
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,120
Techniques use our exploitation
or commonly used ports,

604
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,540
80, 443 using a common
and control protocol.

605
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,070
So mapping to the F3EAD cycle,

606
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,950
starting with detection
of the suspicious traffic

607
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,630
to the firewall logs.

608
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,750
The offending application is removed

609
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,900
with restriction placed
on the victim machine

610
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,530
before assessing the internet.

611
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,080
So IOC of the incident was gathered,

612
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,820
remembers details anonymize,
threat alert was produced

613
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,399
and disseminated to the community

614
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,420
following their TLP protocol.

615
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,830
So this prevented the
same chat form exploiting

616
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,663
other members.

617
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
So I'll end with a key
takeaways from this talk.

618
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,610
So in the short term,
you need to understand

619
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,949
how the idea of OT department
function in your organization.

620
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,800
So in the poll that we conducted,

621
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,860
there may be some that express
joint ownership of OT and IT

622
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,629
in the company concerning
security, budgets, and management,

623
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,499
but however it and OT security

624
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:51,670
needs have to be holistically considered.

625
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,380
So both IT and OT must
work seamlessly together.

626
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,400
So in the medium term, you can do

627
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,500
an asset inventory of the OT and IT asses

628
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,370
such as equipment, devices and processes.

629
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,620
You cannot put that in what
you do not see or know.

630
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
So in the longer term, use a framework

631
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,703
like the Maturity Model to
do a security assessment

632
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:11,450
of your critical infrastructure remediate

633
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,653
the high priority risks.

634
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,850
So in summary, we can minimize the impact

635
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:21,980
to our organization if we prioritize

636
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,830
the protection of our critical assets.

637
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,240
So there are many ways to
increase cyber resilience

638
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,070
of your infrastructure.

639
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,669
And information Intelligence
sharing is one of them.

640
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,960
So Global Resilience
Federation is based in U.S.

641
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,987
supporting Penn high ISAC and ISOA.

642
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:43,430
OT-ISAC it's the latest edition
set up on 1ST October, 2019,

643
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,290
headquartered in Singapore
and support the OT operators

644
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,629
in Asia Pacific.

645
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,340
Is a partnership of
cybersecurity agency, Singapore,

646
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,867
but it's managed independently.

647
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,260
I've come to the end of my presentation.

648
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,140
