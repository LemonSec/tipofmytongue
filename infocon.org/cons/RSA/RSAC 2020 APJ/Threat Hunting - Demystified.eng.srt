1
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:11,450
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,300
- Hello and welcome to

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,670
And thank you all for
joining this session today

12
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,360
at the RSA Conference 2020
Asia Pacific and Japan.

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,340
My name is Ashish Thapar,

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,340
and I'm going to talk to you
today about threat hunting.

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,900
As almost all of you would appreciate

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,450
the cybersecurity landscape

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,940
is in a constant state of change.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,810
And as many organizations have learned,

19
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,720
is no longer a matter of
whether an organization

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,950
will face a cyber attack, but when.

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,480
Attackers are increasingly
trying to hide behind

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,820
the typical noise in an enterprise
IT, IoT or OT environment

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,419
in order to evade automated defenses.

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,828
With the rise of zero-day
and multistage attacks,

25
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,166
it's harder than ever

26
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,759
to protect data and
systems with confidence.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,593
In this session,

28
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:48,530
I would like to highlight the
importance of threat hunting

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,460
to raise the bar from a
cyber defender's perspective,

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,690
starting from its very meaning,

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,030
its benefits, and the
best practice approach

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,563
for its effective implementation
in an organization.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,690
So in terms of my role as the head

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,590
of Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center

35
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,009
for Asia Pacific and Japan region,

36
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,320
my team helps customers on
emergency investigations

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,950
and peacetime capability
development initiatives

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,589
or assessments with respect
to incident response.

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,970
We also help produce data
breach investigations report,

40
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,100
something that Verizon has been
doing for the last 13 years,

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,269
with its latest addition

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,934
in collaboration with 81 contributors.

43
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,300
And when we try to use

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,270
this data breach investigation report

45
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,050
to understand the threat landscape,

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,640
few interesting insights emerge:

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,250
social action, prudential,
and errors are seen

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,110
as the main threat actions

49
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,830
in about 67% of the data breaches.

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,570
As you can see on the chart here,

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,910
errors have gone up in last few years.

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,960
And phishing and use of stolen credentials

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,630
as threat actions have more
or less held their position.

54
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,260
The impact of chip-and-PIN
technology is showing up

55
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,260
as RAM scrapers are not the tool of choice

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,679
by the financially motivated
attackers making money

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,860
out of stolen cardholder data.

58
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,430
Password dumpers are number
one in the malware category.

59
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,160
Now with that kind of high level overview

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,060
of the threat actions,

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,150
let's try to look at the
threat actors and actions

62
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,773
a bit more on my next slide.

63
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,290
So talking of the threat actors,

64
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,269
majority of these threat actors belong

65
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,210
to organized crime syndicates.

66
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,450
That's more than 55%.

67
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,789
About 10% are nation-state
or state-affiliated.

68
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,339
A similar percentage is
from the insider threats

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,000
by the system admins or end users.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,100
And there are some lone wolves as well

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,549
who are not yet part of a syndicate.

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,580
In terms of the motivation,

73
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,300
the threat action actors have
mainly financial motives,

74
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,150
about 85% behind the attacks.

75
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,170
Smaller percentage towards the
espionage comes on the back

76
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,872
of state sponsored or
industrial espionage.

77
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,420
Top threat actions,

78
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,280
if I talk about top
threat action varieties,

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,030
we are talking about things
like social engineering;

80
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,740
mainly phishing, pretexting,
or business email compromise.

81
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,210
I'm sure everybody knows phhing.

82
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,800
Pretexting is a form of social engineering

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,510
where attackers focus on
creating a good pretext

84
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,630
or a fabricated scenario that they use

85
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,917
to try and steal victim's
personal information.

86
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,570
And business email compromise

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,640
is also known as sometimes CFO fraud,

88
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,169
mainly uses an email hijack scenario

89
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,270
to trick the paying entity
into making a wired transfer

90
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,580
to an attacker control bank account.

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,722
Errors; misdelivery misconfiguration

92
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:32,580
is going high as I
mentioned on my last slide,

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,960
reporting rates have gone up.

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,440
I think that's one of the main reasons.

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,760
The other reason is a hushed up movement

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,390
to the Cloud environment.

97
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,223
That's another reason.

98
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:43,230
In fact in this year in the
work from home scenario,

99
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,990
we do expect that such errors possibly

100
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,744
would emerge even more in
terms of the threat actions.

101
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:54,744
About 21% I would say if
you talk about the errors,

102
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,039
in one of the five breaches,

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,600
it's caused by errors,

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
which represents a doubling

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,433
as compared to the last year data set.

106
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,750
So moving on to threat actions

107
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,720
and getting a little bit deeper
dive on hacking and malware.

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,880
In terms of hacking,

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,120
let me just give you a quick definition.

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,220
It's defined as a scenario

111
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,130
where it is the attacker's
infrastructure being used

112
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,490
to carry out the attack,

113
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,000
like fingers on the
keyboard kind of scenarios,

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,730
utilizing manual or automated techniques.

115
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,670
Ninety percent the breaches,

116
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,110
they involve web application attacks

117
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,290
in terms of hacking as an action.

118
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,740
And different varieties are
like use of stolen credentials,

119
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,330
vulnerability exploitation,
and use of backdoor or C2,

120
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,652
command and control.

121
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,810
Looking at malware,

122
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,850
we are looking at malware,

123
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,320
which is obviously defined as a scenario

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,300
where system infrastructure is being used

125
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,193
to run the unauthorized code or binary.

126
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,055
And some of the interesting
insights there are

127
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,300
about 40% of the malware belongs

128
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,130
to password dumper category,

129
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,520
ransomware accounts for about 27%

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,020
of the total malware data set.

131
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,070
So ransomware is going up

132
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,040
as you saw also on the previous slide.

133
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,270
And malware, this is an
interesting one, right?

134
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,340
When we do investigations,

135
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,820
we do see that malware is now
starting to be seen only once,

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,730
so not before, not after
in about 40% of the cases,

137
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,950
which pretty much tells that these malware

138
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,920
are increasingly being unique or targeted.

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,740
Now that we have seen the
type of threat actors,

140
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,830
their motivation, the main
threat actions they do,

141
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,913
let us look at the
victim side of the story.

142
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,900
So when we look at the
victim side of the story,

143
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,789
obviously it's about we have

144
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,290
a very, very busy environment,
noisy environment.

145
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,183
If you take an example of

146
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:46,030
a typical medium-sized organization,

147
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,270
I'm just putting some
numbers to put spotlight

148
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,409
on the scale of the
problem we need to manage.

149
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,690
I've depicted some numbers
on events per second

150
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,100
on some of the commonly seen
systems in an organization,

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,496
very noisy systems like firewall,

152
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:01,210
to the less noisy systems like routers,

153
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,880
or a domain controller which
can also be very chatty.

154
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,880
And we're easily talking
about 1,000 events per second.

155
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,360
In essence about 3.6
million events per day.

156
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,300
Now many auditors may come
to you and they would ask you

157
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,750
to switch on every type of log

158
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,430
in your operating system,
platform, database.

159
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,414
But all these logs add up.

160
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,110
If I can give you an example,

161
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,810
when you take a picture from your camera,

162
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,340
you need to maintain a fine balance

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,869
between adequate lighting
and overexposure.

164
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,333
So how do you find signals from the noise?

165
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,713
It becomes a very serious problem.

166
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,130
And how do you manage the blind spots

167
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,443
in the asset inventory?

168
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,850
That's another problem.

169
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,290
A shadow IT is another
very complex situation

170
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,380
where business teams may come up

171
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,670
with their own IT infrastructure

172
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,010
without even any slightest
of knowledge to the IT team.

173
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,363
Asset said management
becomes very critical.

174
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,330
It may sound boring,

175
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,700
but I can tell you it's main foundation

176
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,180
of any sound threat or
risk management strategy.

177
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,443
Insider threats are very
difficult to detect of course.

178
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:14,010
And if you talk about
things like third parties,

179
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,442
they obviously come in
various shapes and forms;

180
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,380
onsite, offsite, onsite contractors,

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,430
PTP links, extended networks, VPN.

182
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,780
So we're talking about a
large gamut of variables here.

183
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,404
Cloud syndrome we talk about the,

184
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:30,020
one of my favorites of course,

185
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,770
and something that organizations thinks

186
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,319
that it's cool and comfy under the Cloud.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,100
But this perception leads
to some hotter stories.

188
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,524
You need to really protect
your data yourself.

189
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,970
Responsibilities and
roles are very important.

190
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,350
Build controls as usual.

191
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,290
Don't think that Cloud
gives you that cover.

192
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,310
By default follow
defense in depth strategy

193
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,012
and implement a
data-centric security model.

194
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,459
Things about a zero-day vulnerabilities,

195
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,210
very scary, of course,
enough challenge there.

196
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,180
Adding fuel to the fire I would say.

197
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,250
Indicators of compromise,

198
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,800
obviously having a short shelf life.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,660
So in essence what we are talking about

200
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,387
is finding this evil or bad
Nemo if I can take an example

201
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,319
is definitely a big problem.

202
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,030
It must be a problem that
first needs to be acknowledged,

203
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,280
so that we can really
solve it pragmatically.

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,920
Now let's look at the other dimension

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,089
in terms of one of the takeaways

206
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,310
from Verizon data breach
investigation report,

207
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,760
Indians giving their insight
of the detection gap.

208
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,530
Now if you see on the charts,

209
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,930
you see the time to compromise
versus time to discover.

210
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,113
You see the trend line in the
numbers that we are seeing.

211
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,180
Definitely some of the
things that we observe

212
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,849
is that more than half of the beaches

213
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,690
are discovered by external
security researchers.

214
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,910
And discovery in months
or more still accounts

215
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,963
for over a quarter of breaches.

216
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,709
And that's why I would say that

217
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,173
when you look at the protection gap,

218
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,310
and how you want to shorten this gap,

219
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,459
I think the key thing that emerges

220
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,110
is effective and efficient threat hunting

221
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,740
can help shorten this gap.

222
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,170
I would say effective and efficient,

223
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,510
these are two very important keywords.

224
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,540
So till now we looked
at the threat landscape.

225
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,267
We talked about the threat actors.

226
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,170
We also saw the threat
actions they carry out.

227
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,150
We also looked at the noise problem.

228
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm sure you all appreciate
that finding a needle

229
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,780
in the haystack is not easy,

230
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,430
that too when the needle
does not look like a needle.

231
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,599
And that's why I would say that

232
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,890
an assumed breach principal
kind of keeps you on the toes,

233
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,900
elevates your state of readiness

234
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,110
against the cyber adversary.

235
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,200
This means that despite
all protection in place,

236
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
you would assume that system will fail,

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,580
people will make errors,

238
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,010
and adversary may penetrate

239
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,170
the infrastructure or your systems.

240
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,689
But this posture places an organization

241
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,733
in an on standby mode to rapidly detect

242
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:58,160
a compromise and take appropriate actions.

243
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,713
Now that's why threat hunting
becomes very, very important.

244
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,150
So let's kind of do a bit of a deep dive

245
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,150
into understanding what is threat hunting.

246
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,010
So in terms of what is threat hunting,

247
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,480
I would say that it's something
which is hypothesis-driven.

248
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,333
It's a hypothesis-driven exercise.

249
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,600
It's something that where you do proactive

250
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,053
and iterative searching for threats.

251
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:30,310
It's a state where it helps you reduce

252
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,270
the false negatives and shades of gray

253
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,319
in terms of your detection.

254
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,810
It assumes that adversaries

255
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,619
are already present in the infrastructure.

256
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,580
It lays a strong focus on
the indicators of attacks.

257
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,560
So not only focusing on
indicators of compromise,

258
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,339
but also indicators of attacks.

259
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,220
And obviously helps you
prioritize your threat management.

260
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,283
It's also important to now
understand that what it is not.

261
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,420
Many times threat hunting
is used and abused

262
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,780
as a term in the industry.

263
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,520
So there are some myth busters

264
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,828
that I have to share with you.

265
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:06,020
It's not meant to replace
preventive controls

266
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,600
or signature-based detection controls.

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,163
It is not a panacea.

268
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,420
It is expensive yes, I agree.

269
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,250
But it's not expensive to the core

270
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,810
where its benefits outweigh the costs

271
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,329
because I think when you
have a breach situation,

272
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,410
the cost could really
multiply exponentially high.

273
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,680
And also threat hunting is
not only about shiny tools

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,140
like user entity, behavior analytics,

275
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
network detection and response,

276
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,730
endpoint detection and response,

277
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,810
or even a security orchestration
automation response

278
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,719
kind of tools.

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,870
These tools are useful,

280
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,780
but it's not equal to just
implementing these tools

281
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,709
because I strongly believe tools
are garbage in garbage out.

282
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,920
If you don't configure them well,

283
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,699
if you don't have a
robust process around it,

284
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,850
it doesn't really help.

285
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,730
And also this threat hunting
really helps you reduce

286
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,624
the time from a dwell time perspective,

287
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,970
kind of from a compromise to discovery.

288
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,880
That's another way to
look at the detection gap.

289
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,980
It really helps you do that.

290
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,551
But before we start doing threat hunting,

291
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,250
I would strongly say that
we must devise a model.

292
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,723
So I'm going to share
with you today presenting

293
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,120
a five phase model here.

294
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,150
This can help organizations to manage

295
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,470
a threat hunting program.

296
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,420
I think before I get into
this five phase model,

297
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,920
it's important to know that
certain basic fundamentals

298
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
will always remain.

299
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,970
You must know your ground.

300
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,877
You must know your adversery.

301
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,209
You must devise a repeatable approach,

302
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,730
and that's why this model,

303
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,620
this must be done on a recurring basis.

304
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,770
So it should be iterative
and not one time.

305
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,910
The resourcing for threat
hunting must be efficient,

306
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,329
and the execution must be effective.

307
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,690
So with those fundamentals in mind,

308
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,500
let's dive into all the
five phases quickly.

309
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,760
So the first phase;
baselining and objectives.

310
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,730
You're talking about
establishing a program.

311
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,880
That's something very important.

312
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
You need to really have a program

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,710
so that you can improve it,

314
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,440
you can leverage it,

315
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,190
and you need to obtain sponsorship.

316
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,780
Management sponsorship whether
it comes from a support

317
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,670
or a financial sponsorship perspective,

318
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,719
you really need to have
those things in place

319
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,660
because otherwise the program may fail

320
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,430
after you go for certain miles.

321
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,530
You must refer a framework,

322
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,740
some respectable frameworks
like MITRE ATT&CK framework,

323
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,940
cyber kill chain, or even diamond model.

324
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,400
There are multiple ways and means.

325
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,600
One of my personal favorites
is MITRE ATT&CK framework.

326
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,060
You may have your own favorites.

327
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,390
You must define maturity levels.

328
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,720
You need to know where you
are and where you want to go,

329
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,370
Point A to point B kind of thing.

330
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,900
You must get the right
people with the right skills.

331
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,730
And I would say even more
important than right skill

332
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,740
sometimes is the right attitude

333
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,050
because the folks really need
to enjoy doing what they do

334
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,030
for them to really not feel bored about.

335
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,870
This is very interesting concept,

336
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,100
this is a very interesting program.

337
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,650
You need to have people with
the right level of motivation

338
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,610
and attitude to do these kinds of things.

339
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,030
And of course you must
clearly allocate roles

340
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,790
and responsibilities so that
you don't drop the ball,

341
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,502
it goes from one person to
another or one team to another.

342
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,244
So moving on to the next phase,

343
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,005
we're talking about things like

344
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,750
basically setting your target.

345
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,310
Setting your target means
where will you hunt?

346
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,880
What is the data that you would look at?

347
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,689
How big is the sea to find
the bad Nemo, the evil?

348
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,810
So we are talking about
finalizing your data sources

349
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,209
in terms of your network,

350
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,790
whether it is NetFlow,
proxy, DNS, or firewall,

351
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,500
or full packet capture logs.

352
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,020
We're talking about endpoints

353
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,290
of huge amount of
information there as well:

354
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,290
logs, MACB; Modified
Access, Change and Birth,

355
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,940
those kinds of timestamps,

356
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,410
file timestamps are
important, memory artifacts.

357
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,680
There are a lot of system artifacts.

358
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,760
So registry on windows
platform for example,

359
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,630
very, very useful in terms of visibility.

360
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,050
Cloud-based platforms
have their own nuances,

361
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,979
different types of logs,

362
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
also dashboards and alerting mechanisms.

363
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,360
They can really be of good use.

364
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,930
Threat intelligence is
very, very important.

365
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,959
It can help you move faster.

366
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,060
It can help you leverage
what is already known.

367
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,489
So again very important.

368
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,950
Observables obviously come
in different shapes and forms

369
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,640
in terms of your domain names,

370
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,100
your IOSIS, different kind
of indicators of compromise,

371
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,520
IP addresses, just registry
entries, hash values,

372
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,030
different things there.

373
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,160
So next I think the
main important point is

374
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,400
you must decrease the visibility gap.

375
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,579
I think that's a very important point

376
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,430
by collecting as much of data,

377
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,689
but useful amount of data,

378
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,567
don't collect noise.

379
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,610
That's why the earlier point

380
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,550
was signals to noise
ratio is very important.

381
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,699
You must collect data which is useful.

382
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,940
You must review the verbosity of logs.

383
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,820
Again back to the noise point problem

384
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,730
that you don't want too
much noise in your logs

385
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,915
which is not useful.

386
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:53,372
Restrict yourself to data which is useful.

387
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,910
So that's why the total repeatable

388
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,290
and iterated process is important.

389
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,579
You must collect this,
enrich all that data,

390
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,470
and normalize it.

391
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,030
So make it in a form and shape

392
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,530
which is analyzable in an easy manner,

393
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,639
in an automated manner.

394
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,890
And that's why you must
leverage automation

395
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,690
to make it faster, better,

396
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,420
and effective every time you do it.

397
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,960
So that's about the second phase.

398
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,339
So basically setting your target

399
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,530
in terms of where will you hunt?

400
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,903
What is the data on which you will hunt?

401
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,790
So moving on to phase three,

402
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,349
we are talking about the arsenal.

403
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,158
This is all about sharpening your arrows,

404
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,970
creating your infrastructure,

405
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,780
your arsenal on which you will work on.

406
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,070
So threat intelligence
feeds are important.

407
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,370
There are a lot of open
source paid feeds available.

408
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,389
You can look at that.

409
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,400
There are a lot of lookup
sources like ThreatCloud,

410
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Whites Total, PDNS, WHOIS, GeoIntel,

411
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,320
domain tools, Shodan.io, Censys.io,

412
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,804
a whole amount of
information is available.

413
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:54,560
And of course you also need to look

414
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,620
at different types of platforms.

415
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,030
So SIEM or SOAR platforms,

416
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,110
endpoint detection and response,

417
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,929
don't forget the the typical
easy to implement Sysmon.

418
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,590
It's easy, it's free.

419
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,970
You can easily make
use of it, very useful.

420
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,420
Network detection response at
the network telemetry level

421
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,423
is again increasingly important.

422
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,720
And in terms of the antivirus,

423
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,700
I can't stress enough.

424
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,040
Even the antivirus is
a very important source

425
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,770
of your information that
you want to leverage

426
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,210
from your platform perspective

427
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,930
because even if a malware

428
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,533
that got quarantined or
deleted has a story to tell.

429
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,930
So things like geo-location
like I mentioned.

430
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,930
National Software Resource
Library again become a laboratory

431
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,623
in terms of the known
good that's important.

432
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,820
And threat intel platforms
like I mentioned earlier,

433
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,810
a few of those are critical.

434
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,490
Understanding the TTPs
of the threat actors,

435
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,870
again comes handy from
let's say attack matrices

436
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,543
that are available from MITRE.

437
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,300
You must have a very robust
log management platform

438
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
or a data lake on which
you will really work on.

439
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,320
You need to have a consolidated data set.

440
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,153
Like I said earlier,

441
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,670
develop automation and
visualization at this point.

442
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,140
So you must use platforms like SOF-ELK

443
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,490
or things like HELK,
H-E-L-K, the Hunting ELK.

444
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,820
That's an open source platform

445
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,629
specifically meant for threat hunting.

446
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,117
Again you can have a look at that

447
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,593
to leverage in your
threat hunting program.

448
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,870
Let's move on to the next phase
talking about the execution.

449
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,700
This is very important phase.

450
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,320
Now that you have set your target

451
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
on what data you will look at,

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
where will you hunt?

453
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,659
You've readied your arsenal so to say,

454
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,193
sharpen your arrows already.

455
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,520
I think the main thing I would like to say

456
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,610
is that start small in this phase.

457
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,620
Focus on your crown jewels.

458
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,520
That's very important.

459
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,440
You can't have a big bang
approach of looking at everything.

460
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,890
You need to really stick yourself

461
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,700
to let's say the main
important assets to start with.

462
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Form a hypothesis, right?

463
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,533
This is very important.

464
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:59,219
The 5W and the 1H approach;

465
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,423
5W as in like what, where, why, when, who.

466
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,894
And 1H as in how.

467
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,090
You need to really have that hypothesis

468
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,629
before you even execute a
proper threat hunting exercise.

469
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,472
And there are different
hunting techniques;

470
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,091
things like searching, clustering,

471
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,740
grouping frequency analysis,

472
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,260
we also call it stacking sometimes

473
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,710
to understand and identify
aberrations and anomalies.

474
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,380
It's all about finding that unknown,

475
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,350
and that's why these techniques
become very, very important.

476
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,649
You must be aware of the
data or cognitive biases.

477
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,340
You must know that you don't
have certain amount of data,

478
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,030
or you have certain
amount of data too much.

479
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,660
You need to know your biases

480
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,003
so you can take a calculated call there.

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,390
You must decide your frequency

482
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,520
because you need to like I said,

483
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,580
it's an iterative process,

484
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,513
so you need to kind of execute
it on an ongoing basis.

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,833
Can't stress enough.

486
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,804
Automation and visualization is important.

487
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,370
It's a human initiated effort,

488
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,520
but you need to automate
it so you can do it faster

489
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,300
because it's time consuming.

490
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,169
So anything which you care about,

491
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,220
you can automate,

492
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,200
make some scripts,

493
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,380
make some automation,

494
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,490
and make some visualization.

495
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,747
Pictures speak 1,000 words.

496
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,850
So it's important to kind of have

497
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,879
that visualization component.

498
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,900
I gave you the example of software

499
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,695
or some of the commercial
platforms that are available.

500
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:18,120
HELK like I mentioned can give you

501
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,030
some amount of visualization.

502
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,300
And I think you must not kind of depend

503
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,370
on a one team strategy.

504
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,520
You must leverage collaboration,

505
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
bring in new perspective.

506
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,850
Maybe just involve other teams;

507
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,169
SecOps team, right teaming kind of teams

508
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,703
that do penetration testing
and right teaming exercises.

509
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:41,790
Bring them also into the
play to really look at,

510
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,010
are you doing it better?

511
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,650
What are the improvement
areas that you can look at,

512
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,923
and how can you really make it
more effective and efficient?

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,917
So in terms of the last phase,

514
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:52,976
we are talking about improvising.

515
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:55,210
This is where you really take stock

516
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,460
of what all has happened.

517
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,780
What all have you done?

518
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,965
And how well have you done it?

519
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,199
Or what are the learnings?

520
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,320
Refining the metrics is important.

521
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,260
You must gauge your maturity level again.

522
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,430
You must maintain statistics

523
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,570
because if you don't measure something,

524
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,750
you can't improve it.

525
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,080
And of course you can't maintain it.

526
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,370
So you need to have
some measurement there.

527
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,000
You must identify those visibility gaps.

528
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,960
Let's say you were doing
a threat hunting execution

529
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,310
and you found that alright you know what?

530
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,679
If I had that particular component here,

531
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,660
it would have made my life
simpler and easier, why not?

532
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,210
Let's identify that.

533
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,520
Remove those biases.

534
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,990
And you must feed back

535
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,310
to the baselining and objectives phase.

536
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,720
So it's iterative, it's a cyclic loop.

537
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,459
And that's how I would say

538
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:43,459
I would summarize the five
step kind of hunting model.

539
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,409
So the cycle, the fabulous five.

540
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,380
But just a reminder there,

541
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm available on Slido.

542
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,399
So if you have any questions
or you have any feedback,

543
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,220
please feel free to put it to Slido,

544
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,200
and I will surely get
to it towards the end.

545
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,608
Now let us quickly walk
through a sample use case.

546
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:07,480
Let us hunt for let's say for
example as a sample use case,

547
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,610
hunt for C2 connections
in your enterprise,

548
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,040
command and control connections.

549
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,720
Follow the same five phase
threat hunting model.

550
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,960
We start with baselining and objectives.

551
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,070
So we start with let's say
the MITRE ATT&CK framework,

552
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,550
we find out the TTPs,

553
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,698
and we define threat hunting team.

554
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,570
After that we look at our target.

555
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,850
So let's say in terms of data sources

556
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,060
for this particular use case,

557
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,919
we can look at proxy logs, DNS logs,

558
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,633
SMTP logs, Mail logs,
as well as NetFlow data.

559
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,200
In terms of our arsenal,

560
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,481
we are looking at things
like SIEM dashboard,

561
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,450
Endpoint Detection Response console,

562
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,320
Joe's Sandbox for malware
testing or analysis,

563
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,210
dynamic analysis, or maybe
for example things like

564
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,591
even GCHQ CyberChef sometimes
becomes very useful.

565
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:58,620
It's also I would say
free at least to use,

566
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,649
and something where you are useful

567
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,960
in kind of handling some
of the obfuscated data

568
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,743
what you can encounter.

569
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,020
In the next phase,

570
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,580
we talk about actual execution.

571
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,550
So when we talk about execution,

572
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,100
we're talking about things like

573
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,750
we start with making hypothesis.

574
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,070
So attackers operating a C2 channel

575
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,550
that uses a custom encryption.

576
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,860
Search for anomalous domains,

577
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,490
user-agent strings or URLs.

578
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,900
And that's important.

579
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,780
Look for odd protocol usage.

580
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,389
So for example let's say
HTTP connection on port 80

581
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,680
with no or unusual metadata,

582
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,173
just as an example.

583
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:41,910
And once you gather all that data,

584
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,630
just kind of sort it
in a decreasing order.

585
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,440
And that's where you start
doing your frequency analysis,

586
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,273
you do stacking.

587
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,220
And maybe it can be done on DNS queries.

588
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,220
It can be done on HTTP GET or
POST submissions to website.

589
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,680
So all that can be done
to identify anomalies.

590
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,760
Remember I talked about
aberrations anomalies detection.

591
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,320
Check on network accounting information.

592
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,560
It becomes very, very useful;

593
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,220
bytes-in, bytes-out, session time.

594
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,510
It becomes very useful in terms of

595
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,560
if you see some beckoning regular traffic

596
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,899
which is going out,

597
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,883
that could possibly be
indicating something suspicious.

598
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,980
Indicators searching, right?

599
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,640
So that's where your threat
hunting comes very handy,

600
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,280
leveraging your threat intelligence data.

601
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,080
And then of course
establishing 'known good'

602
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,679
and 'known bad' examples
to build your training set.

603
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,910
Malware analysis of suspected processes

604
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,310
will also be very useful
once you get to really,

605
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,240
let's say on a machine,

606
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,180
you find out a particular
suspicious process,

607
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,710
you can possibly do a malware analysis.

608
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,760
You can dump that executable
and you can analyze it further

609
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,350
to identify what is really
initiating the C2 connection.

610
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,629
There are many of the
things as an example,

611
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,550
things like HTML response sizes,
geographical irregularities

612
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,260
in terms of the connections
being initiated,

613
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,580
DNS requests anomalies,

614
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,582
process name analysis
across the whole spectrum.

615
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,230
There are multiple things that you can do.

616
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,020
Command line analysis, top talkers,

617
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,230
very simple things that we've been doing

618
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,180
for over the years becomes quite useful

619
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,920
in this kind of techniques.

620
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,270
So this is just an example.

621
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,070
So we walked through all these things,

622
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,850
these five phases.

623
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,195
And hopefully you get some example

624
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,235
in this short amount of
time that we have today.

625
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:29,453
And we use it for improvising
it for future purposes.

626
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:35,250
So we've pretty much kind of talked

627
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,250
about some good insights.

628
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,810
So how to design your
threat hunting program

629
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,210
through this session while being aware

630
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,100
of the key challenges that you face.

631
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,879
On this slide I'm trying
to kind of summarize

632
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,730
my take on some 10 commandments

633
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,846
for effective threat hunting.

634
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,140
Like I said earlier,

635
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,300
gauge your cybersecurity maturity level,

636
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,680
allocate the right resources,

637
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,640
know your ground,

638
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,403
asset management is important,
vulnerability management.

639
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:00,070
It's also important to understand

640
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,399
the vulnerability landscape.

641
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,810
Risk register, focus on your crown jewels,

642
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,637
understand the risks that you have.

643
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,040
Mind the insider threat.

644
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,389
I think the insider threat,

645
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,970
human element is also a theme
in this year's conference.

646
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,270
I think insider threat I
would say is connected to it.

647
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,730
So people are most important
assets and most critical.

648
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,820
And also the insider threat element of it

649
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,970
is also quite tricky.

650
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,040
So you need to manage that angle.

651
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,510
Ensure your network visibility,

652
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,020
uncover your blind spots.

653
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,240
I can't stress enough.

654
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,870
Know your adversary,

655
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,679
that's also very important.

656
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,513
Leverage a robust framework.

657
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:35,980
There's a lot of good work
done by existing frameworks

658
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,750
or leverage those,

659
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,910
and few other things mentioned.

660
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,170
And I think the most important thing

661
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,550
I would just leave you with
is that integrate robustly

662
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,250
with other threat detection strategies.

663
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,490
I don't think that threat hunting

664
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,760
is the only thing you need to focus on.

665
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
This is to augment

666
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,810
your existing threat detection strategies.

667
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,690
So use it in that manner,

668
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,293
and of course define metrics
for the threat hunting program.

669
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,380
So we hope you've got
some good insights here,

670
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,500
and we are talking about
obviously some call to action.

671
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,850
So I would like to highlight
some call to action

672
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,149
for those who would like to implement

673
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,780
what you understood today

674
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,440
because I strongly believe

675
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,400
that failing to plan is planning to fail.

676
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,690
So always it's good to kind
of have a plan to execute.

677
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,360
So I would say that next week,

678
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,540
maybe you should understand and gauge

679
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,610
the maturity of your organization

680
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,159
with respect to threat hunting.

681
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
In the first three months,

682
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,990
recognize those critical assets processes,

683
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,740
business processes, systems
of your organization

684
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,210
with respect to the data and the systems

685
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,910
that becomes critical out of that.

686
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,410
Understand the organization's
risk profile, threats.

687
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,180
And from a threat perspective,

688
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,270
understand the tactics,
techniques, and procedures,

689
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,120
the TTPs of the threat actors,

690
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,719
start getting information
from open source intelligence

691
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,740
or commercial intelligence sources,

692
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,030
that becomes quite critical

693
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,266
to leverage what existing
knowledge already is there.

694
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,540
But I would still stress
that while you look

695
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,990
at indicators of compromise,

696
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,050
you must also use an approach

697
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,010
to kind of look at indicators of attacks.

698
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,740
So that's how you kind of move the bar up

699
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,459
to change the game,

700
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,550
elevate the level of your game.

701
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,680
Within the six months,

702
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,315
I would say you should
implement automation solutions

703
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:29,580
to increase your visibility
in the digital ecosystem.

704
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,840
Well this could be a stretch timeline,

705
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,129
but I would say that just you will take,

706
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,060
this is what I would recommend.

707
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,120
You can have your own mileage there.

708
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,629
Establish a telemetry baseline,

709
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,463
build your arsenal.

710
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:42,379
I think keep building
your tools and platforms

711
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,800
that can help you to
start hunting effectively.

712
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,889
And I would say I think
last but not least,

713
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,100
run sprints initially,

714
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,409
the short runs,

715
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,570
and eventually move
towards running periodic

716
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,790
and defined threat hunting campaigns.

717
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,340
So I think that's how I
would summarize my session.

718
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,129
Thank you for your time today.

719
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,650

721
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,139
I would be there to kind
of answer your questions.

722
