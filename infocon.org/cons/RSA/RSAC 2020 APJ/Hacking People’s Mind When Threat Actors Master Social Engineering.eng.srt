00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,290
I'd now like to turn it over to Tal Dawson

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,323
and Donna Peleg for the presentation.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,920
- Okay, hi everyone.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,070
So, welcome join me
into our session today.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,910
So what are we gonna discuss

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,744
about are a couple of recent things,

12
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:35,660
such as the recent changes
in the digital world,

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,110
this is all part of what
we're just seeing across

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,540
the entire world is part
of the COVID-19 dynamic.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,370
We're also gonna see
how threats are changed

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,059
and how they adapted to the
recent pandemic that's going on.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,713
Usually coming from the
social engineering aspect,

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,360
we gonna go on a small deep dive into few

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,860
and different facts and of
course by the end of the session,

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,010
we're gonna present you
with some countermeasure

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,283
and useful tips on how
to protect yourself.

22
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:14,009
So, going right in, we will cover threats

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,410
from different types of scopes.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,580
We gonna go into the web type of threats

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,714
and we're gonna touch on
desktop network RAT malware

26
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,560
of course, Phishing and Smishing

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,590
and how spoofing is part of this.

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,480
Later on, we gonna touch
on the mobile domain,

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,810
when we gonna discuss one
of the most prominent cracks

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,170
in that space, which is
the Mobile Overlay Malware.

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,620
This is a really advanced

32
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,102
and we have a really
cool demo to show you.

33
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:48,102
This is relevant for the
Android mobile operating system.

34
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:53,940
And of course, we gonna touch
on how social engineering

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,100
which is our major theme
in that presentation

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,633
is being involved in any
of digital transformation.

37
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,710
So digital transformation is accelerated

38
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,610
and why it's accelerated?

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,610
Well COVID-19 was is actually
one of the major reasons

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,109
of why a lot of businesses these days

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,260
are going into digital,

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,459
right, even businesses that
didn't have this before,

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,100
they're just going in adding it,

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,420
whether it's like in these
domains you're seeing here

45
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,890
in this slide where like,
insurance, telecommunication,

46
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,880
transportation, online banking
was already there, right,

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,790
but it's just expanding and
going more and more difficult.

48
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,613
So we're gonna see how
threats are being impacted.

49
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:41,070
So when we see rise in threats

50
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,113
so we see them usually happening,

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,890
as I said, part of the
digital transformation

52
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,500
and when decelerating

53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,350
and threats are just important targets.

54
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,930
Of course when there is a holiday season

55
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,820
and what we see just right
before it was a major rise

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,393
in threats targeting,

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,340
usually if we're talking about fraud

58
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,173
and users around the world,

59
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,810
we see a major increase that as well.

60
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,440
And, of course, the COVID-19

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,623
when everyone was working
from home right now,

62
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:15,859
it's one of the major
reasons of the attacks

63
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,841
that being, you know, rotor,
and that they actually adopted

64
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,743
this to this time.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,110
So how COVID-19 changed
the threat landscape?

66
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,811
So first of all, as I said,
the digital transformation

67
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:34,720
basically accelerated and
now a lot of new businesses

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,420
are opening up digitally,

69
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,791
which means that more
of more brand X doors

70
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,289
are on one death and delivery.

71
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:47,289
And once there are a lot
of unsecured businesses,

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,458
for example, when a business
just, you know, go offline,

73
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,376
with a new platform new online platform.

74
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:59,040
These businesses made it so fast

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,450
that they didn't have the right
security measures in place.

76
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,239
So a lot of track tours are
knowing that and they're looking

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,973
for these targets, these
new targets are you know,

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,400
to actually placing their targets

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,570
but what else we know
is that a lot of people

80
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,620
are now working from home,

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,160
actually increased the unmanaged

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,530
the amount of unmanaged corporate devices

83
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,820
that are now can be found worldwide,

84
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,140
whether there was a business
before COVID-19 that you know,

85
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,240
came to the office and just use

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,654
their own corporate protected,

87
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,270
let's put it this way.

88
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,210
Devices these days, a lot of
businesses tell their employees

89
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,567
okay use their own computers.

90
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:46,567
And this is a serious, you
know, an open up for, you know,

91
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,776
for threats basically,

92
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:51,650
and vulnerabilities of course to go over

93
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,080
these unmanaged computers
designed to manage devices

94
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,996
and just target them

95
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,110
and of course, due to those two reasons,

96
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,633
what we see is the attacks in magnitude.

97
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:04,764
I mean, the magnitude of
these attacks of course,

98
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,420
is just rising and rising,

99
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,130
especially when we saw
we were in the first wave

100
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,800
of COVID-19 around the world.

101
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,880
And of course, we're
gonna see in that session,

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,610
how the attacks are
actually adapted themselves

103
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,264
to these time, so I'm not
gonna stay here too much.

104
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:24,233
And we'll just go deep diving into this.

105
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,807
So I wonna start with Desktop Malware.

106
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:28,732
So in Desktop Malware we're gonna discuss

107
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:33,732
the top noticed threats
that we're seeing recently,

108
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,800
usually coming from our
perspective from our labs.

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,310
So the first one is Remote Access Trojans,

110
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,590
then we're gonna touch on a little bit

111
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,714
about Information Stealers
because they're really popular.

112
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,714
And we gonna end up with Banking Trojans,

113
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,785
which not going in.

114
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:55,785
So what we see in the Remote
Access Trojans domain,

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,960
we have let's put it this way.

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,022
Three types of tools that can be gathered

117
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:04,470
as part of a taxing deathmatch.

118
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,040
First one is tools that can be purchased

119
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,340
on dark web for example.

120
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,299
There are plenty of commercial tools

121
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,780
commercial remote access Trojans
are being sold over there.

122
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,969
They are the ones who have been modified

123
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,750
for malicious purposes as
part of their legitimate use,

124
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,050
for example, a malicious interviewer

125
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,020
or a malicious you know,
an abused interviewer

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,549
that was incorporated
into the usage of malware.

127
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,070
And of course, there is always

128
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,000
your social engineering attacks

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,490
that involves remote access
tools legitimate tools

130
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,740
such as TeamViewer, LogMeIn,
and all the ones you're know

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,250
from your day to day.

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,130
So, I'm gonna take one example

133
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,730
the one I said the first one
I gave with a commercial fun

134
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,024
when we see an organized threat actors

135
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:59,960
being leveraging the
tools into their course

136
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,330
which, in our domain in our space,

137
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,700
what we see them is they
wonna get information

138
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,990
and of course they wonna get money.

139
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,010
So how are they operating,

140
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,010
they actually being leverage techniques

141
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,800
coming from advanced
persistent threat groups.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,120
And these groups of activating
the remote access Trojan,

143
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,340
so they're starting with
a reconnaissance phase

144
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,369
when they're looking for prey,

145
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,660
someone that will be easier to you know,

146
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,930
loot for and get into the organization.

147
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,440
Usually they will send
some kind of an attachment

148
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,880
with malicious macro, download threat,

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,130
from that phase, they will, you know,

150
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,750
look up on their lateral movement phase

151
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,710
when they're gonna
actually go to the person

152
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,280
who holds the, you know, for example,

153
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,260
the key for the money of the organization

154
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,771
usually a financial officer
or financial analyst

155
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:55,140
has a you know, the
credentials and the ability

156
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,491
to login into business
account over the business

157
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:04,492
logging financial
accounts over the weather,

158
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:09,890
online banking, of course and
from that point the fraudster

159
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,490
will start to do is steal
espionage email try to monitor

160
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,260
for sometimes it could even take weeks

161
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,099
until he finds the right target.

162
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,430
And from that point,

163
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,230
it can be used by social
engineering techniques

164
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,210
to do many types of attack backwards,

165
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,943
whether it's to take out the money itself,

166
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:34,380
or conducting a business
email compromise, or whatnot.

167
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,620
So this is one thing we're seeing,

168
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,780
and we're seeing an
increasing these attacks.

169
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,189
For example, here we have
stats from our lab of Nanocore

170
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,160
Nanocore is very popular
during these times.

171
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,847
And we see the rise in
infection during around COVID-19

172
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:52,410
you know, was just
dropped within the world

173
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,410
taking effect in a other
than that, you see also

174
00:08:58,085 --> 00:09:03,085
threats in social engineering
attempts to deliver them,

175
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,220
such as infrastructure as of course

176
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,072
that join the RAT session
that we just covered

177
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:14,072
of different forms coming
from the wolf organization

178
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,090
coming from the SBA is there just think

179
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,210
they are gonna send some stimulus attack.

180
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,280
But this is basically
gonna be some practice

181
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,979
in the attachment, as I said,

182
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,920
embedded in a Microsoft Office document

183
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,693
as a malicious macro, and
there's the modern board.

184
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,010
Now I'm gonna touch like
another popular backdoor,

185
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,460
which is Remote Overlay.

186
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,917
Remote Overlays the stop case
of attacks that we're seeing

187
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,180
as part of the remote
access plastic Trojans,

188
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,459
as I just lay, what this is different.

189
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,430
It's basically what you're gonna see

190
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,209
in the short video that has here,

191
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,497
that in this attack what we know

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,560
is that the attacker will
show after infections phase,

193
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,420
the attacker will show
different screens to the user

194
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,500
in order to steal second
factor authentication,

195
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,090
one thing, password
and some other manners,

196
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,650
you know, multi factor authentication.

197
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,060
So here we have in this demo,

198
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,262
we have a reconstruction
of a Remote Overlay malware

199
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,720
that we did in our lab.

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,529
On the left side of the screen,

201
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,490
you see the fraudsters screen.

202
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,067
On the right side of the screen
you see the victim screen.

203
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:35,067
And in this in the right
side, you see some fake screen

204
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:38,480
that's actually blocking
the user screen telling him

205
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,460
that there is some kind of an
update that's been going on.

206
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,993
In that case, our victim
logged in into some kind

207
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:51,273
of a cryptocurrency
platform that he you know,

208
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:54,380
just wonna check out his
balance and stuff maybe money,

209
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,820
but this time, the fraudster
are actually taking control.

210
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,860
So you can see on the
left side of the screen,

211
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,500
there was a planning options
that we have reconstructed,

212
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,480
and you can send the victim,

213
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,280
many types of second
factor authentication,

214
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,122
that the fraudster just customized.

215
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:14,319
So that's that that can be
done in order to, you know,

216
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,733
ask the fraudsters for
different types of NFA

217
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:22,850
what's you're seeing
now in the current slide

218
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,130
is an abusing zoom meetings,

219
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,670
we noticed in the spirit of the COVID-19

220
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:32,100
zoom is probably most
one of the most popular

221
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,830
meeting applications worldwide.

222
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,830
So here in that case, we have
research an interesting case

223
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,490
of remote overlay network,

224
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,680
which the actual malware
doing DLL hijacking.

225
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,251
DLL hijacking is unique when you can load

226
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,970
and take an original binary for example,

227
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,570
in this example, the
original binary was zoom

228
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,700
and loaded With a malicious DLL file

229
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,460
that actually being loaded
up with the malware itself,

230
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,720
that's causing a lot of
other security vendors,

231
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,170
anti viruses and so on to just, you know,

232
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,181
not being able to remove
that threat or mitigate it.

233
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:21,182
Really, though that's this is
one of the popular techniques

234
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,609
that we're seeing worldwide,

235
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,020
usually being used with a sort of malware

236
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,170
it's not limited

237
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,423
to this specific attack
something with this.

238
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Moving on, before I wrap up this session,

239
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,511
I mean, this section employ,
we see another attacks

240
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,819
being abused and delivered,

241
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,870
COVID-19 with social

242
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,060
with advanced social engineering effects.

243
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,630
These are the notorious examples of things

244
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,860
that we just uncovered a few months ago

245
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,900
as it was returned and made a comeback.

246
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,770
We didn't see this malware,
hacked or operated things

247
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,770
2017 and it just came
back with a tax bill.

248
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,119
So carry the tax was usually
Australia, New Zealand

249
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,807
was the target that we saw.

250
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:14,920
And Emotet when we actually
were able to deliver

251
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,920
to be able to actually spot
attacks that were delivered

252
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,500
in Japan using a customized
social engineering attack,

253
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,400
we also were the ones
who report that well,

254
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,800
so these actors that are spreading

255
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,420
and continue to spreading
financial malware,

256
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,089
these ones are basically still operating.

257
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,210
There's still using different types

258
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,800
of social engineering attacks,

259
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,270
usually around these times
around these pandemic

260
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,430
and they're doing is pretty
much let's put it this way well

261
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,810
for their own profit.

262
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,762
So from this point, I'm gonna
hand over to Donna Peleg,

263
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:58,144
which she can go into continuing cover.

264
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,089
- Okay, thank you Tal.

265
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,090
So I'm going to discuss
some phishing threats

266
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,400
and mobile threats and
then we'll, you know,

267
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,420
summarize and run out the session.

268
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,420
So, if you talk about, you know phishing,

269
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,709
it's something that is a very old threat,

270
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,680
and people thought it would go away,

271
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,239
but it's here to stay.

272
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,940
And he talked about social engineering

273
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,130
and let's say social engineering kingdom,

274
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,860
then phishing is this kingdoms King.

275
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,850
So what we see is basically,

276
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,920
first of all arise in phishing sites,

277
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,020
we see a growth in top level
domain with registrations,

278
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,899
so it used to be just.org.com.

279
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,840
Now you have dots TV dot space,

280
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,650
very unique TLDs top level domains.

281
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,439
We used to tell our grandparents
that in order to stay safe

282
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,760
from phishing sites, you
need to base basically

283
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,860
have the padlock in the browser,

284
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,860
you need to have the HTTPS
at the beginning of the URL.

285
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,860
And so basically, now we know
that it's almost no longer,

286
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,640
you know, even relevant
fraudsters and attackers

287
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,480
are starting to use SSL certificates

288
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,630
in their phishing sites.

289
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,060
So it's not necessarily
means that the site

290
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,500
is the communication is safe.

291
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,989
We also see a boost in phishing kits

292
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,790
with facial randomization folder.

293
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,341
So what it means is they just
create one phishing attack

294
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:37,800
they hack into just one legitimate domain,

295
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,361
and they plan their special
key that actually changes

296
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:45,810
its folder at the end of
the URL changes the folder

297
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,270
and creates a lot of unique URLs.

298
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,771
And we're talking about
a significant amount,

299
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:55,036
such as, you know, thousands
of URLs just from one

300
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,430
phishing attack and
this is basically going

301
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,050
and staying under the radar,

302
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,849
and is able to overcome

303
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,453
a lot of security measures and products.

304
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,390
And of course, we're also
seeing the statistics

305
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,939
of the previous quarters.

306
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,690
What we see and what we
expect to see basically

307
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,410
is that we still don't have the
current quarters statistics.

308
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,410
So this is 2020 queue and
we are definitely expecting

309
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,300
to see a significant
rise due to this pandemic

310
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,772
and this period that we are currently on.

311
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,650
So, if we're talking about the pandemic,

312
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,163
we say that people are
leveraging everything

313
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,400
that is going on around right now.

314
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,150
So people are around the
world it's a global issue

315
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,420
are very very you know,
they have an existence

316
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,490
existing a general fear
and financial concerns

317
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,300
that they don't know when and if things

318
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,300
will actually figure out
and they are also utilizing

319
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,170
the financial fear of people
if they going to come out

320
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,150
of this very tough situation,

321
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,060
so actors are basically trying to imitate

322
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,540
first of all governmental
sites that offer relief,

323
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,319
money relief, which is of course fake,

324
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,290
they are also imitating
online banking sites,

325
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,450
which is something that we
already know and familiar with,

326
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,200
but now they already started targeting,

327
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,530
working from home themed
sites and platforms,

328
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,160
and you're gonna see
some of that right now.

329
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,440
So if we talked about the
financial part, and here it is,

330
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,310
this is an example of the
UK Government relief page

331
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,419
is of course completely fake.

332
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,040
And you just they asked for the credential

333
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,570
so they can pay back your
money and people fall

334
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,490
for that because they are very scared

335
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,711
and are very concerned with
their financial situation.

336
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,711
We are also seeing a
lot of online sessions

337
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,510
or online meetings applications
are being targeted.

338
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,560
So for example, Cisco
Webex is very much used,

339
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,070
and it's very common.

340
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,220
And we see here an email advising

341
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,060
that there are some vulnerabilities

342
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,610
and you should update
it and then of course,

343
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,670
a completely fake and phishing page

344
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,420
to enter your credentials there.

345
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,960
So here you're also entering
your organization credentials.

346
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,590
It's not just your own
private credentials,

347
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,340
and they can infiltrate your
organization's using that.

348
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,470
Another thing that you're seeing

349
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,470
is in phishing attacks targeting
the organizational systems,

350
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,091
so here it is they're sending an email

351
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:52,280
allegedly from the IT of the company.

352
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,950
This is from the help desk
but of course completely fake

353
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,440
advising to logging to the staff portal

354
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,390
also way to get to your
organizational credentials,

355
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,180
and here it is this is, I
think the most interesting one.

356
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,890
So here they are talking about the fact

357
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,410
that we have lost the
colleague to the deadly virus,

358
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,990
which is of course completely fake,

359
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,530
but they're trying to do
whatever they can to scare people

360
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,879
and you know, make them
fear for their lives.

361
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,300
And this is social engineering
and it's best Of course,

362
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,300
and then they are
targeting 360s environment

363
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,909
that is also for to phish the
organizational credentials.

364
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,160
Once you enter your credentials,

365
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,900
you're being passed on to this page.

366
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,630
And of course, you're not being lumped

367
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,300
into your organization's system.

368
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,133
Now we're also seeing increase

369
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,090
in Smishing and Vishing attacks,

370
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,090
so smishing is basically phishing
attacks delivered by SMS.

371
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,180
And of course, here we also see

372
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,621
how they were affected by the pandemic.

373
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:58,621
Here it is, the Red Cross
is providing surgical masks

374
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,830
and of course, completely fake as well,

375
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,540
breaking news, banks may be closing.

376
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,260
So again scaring tactics.

377
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,260
And also here again,
they are promised to help

378
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,570
their citizens to to combat
the COVID-19 results.

379
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,209
So this is about the phishing,

380
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,250
I'm going to move on
to the Mobile Threats.

381
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,640
And the main one, the
star of the mobile malware

382
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,303
will be the Overlay Malware for mobile.

383
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,850
And the thing is that
everyone is are vulnerable.

384
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,959
So if you have an app,

385
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,070
you're vulnerable to being
targeted by this mobile,

386
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,860
and it's a global thing, very common.

387
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,699
And we see that these are
the main or several families

388
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,060
and these are the main one

389
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,220
that are targeting around the world.

390
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,510
I'm going to show you just a short demo

391
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,510
of ExoBot which is one family
of the mobile overlay malware.

392
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,780
So this is what you're going
to see on the victims end.

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,820
And what you see here is that he's opening

394
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,870
the flash application of course,

395
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,320
there is no flash player for Android.

396
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,179
So this is a fake application

397
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,820
and it basically what it should do

398
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,290
is just a malware to run on that device.

399
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,627
So what will happen is that
the malware will monitor

400
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,370
for the victims actions, and
he will wait that the victim

401
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,321
will open a targeted application.

402
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,540
Here in this demo, we're using

403
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,409
the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase.

404
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,630
Now you see a window has just came up

405
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,550
and it's covering the
legitimate application.

406
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,330
This is a fake window, asking
for the victims credentials.

407
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,439
And this actor is really smart

408
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,490
and he's taking into consideration

409
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,051
that we're all human and that
we sometimes make mistakes.

410
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:03,939
So what he will do is, he
will ask the victim to enter

411
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,940
his credentials twice, here it is,

412
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,890
it will basically shake it and advise

413
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,550
that the credentials are incorrect,

414
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,850
and there are typos there,

415
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,449
and the user will enter
his credentials once again.

416
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,300
So for every victim, he has
two instances of credentials,

417
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,649
just to make sure that the
perfect fraud is being conducted

418
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,760
and he just get away with it.

419
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,580
So this is what we see on the victims end

420
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,610
and as soon as he enters his credentials,

421
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,219
the overlay screen disappears,

422
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,830
and the malware is just wrapped up

423
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,273
and now you see you're able
to see that legitimate app.

424
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,280
So moving on, let's talk
about how it looks like

425
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,110
from the actors perspective.

426
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,772
So of course, for every malware,

427
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,713
there is a command and control panel

428
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:52,460
to be able to see what
the actor has obtained

429
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,660
and who fell for his attack.

430
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,660
So this is the CNC one of the malware.

431
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,130
And I'm just trying to present that.

432
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay, so this is the login screen.

433
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,960
So if you have seen it
somewhere along the way

434
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,370
old command and control panels,

435
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,780
you know that this is a
very much advanced one,

436
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,540
it's very unique, it looks really good.

437
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,610
The previous one when,
if you ever seen one

438
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,949
looks pretty bad.

439
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,050
So they are getting more
and more sophisticated

440
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,350
and up to date and the
design looks really good.

441
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,100
And here it is project news.

442
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,959
Once you're logged in, of course,

443
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,590
this was already constructed
in our lab by our researchers.

444
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,937
So you have project news,

445
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,160
which is updates and it's really cool.

446
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,820
You have statistics divided by country

447
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,439
and language and tags and whatnot.

448
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,460
And, you know, you can even
make a KPI presentation

449
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,490
for your boss.

450
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,130
So which is the actor
itself, but it's really good.

451
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,618
It provides a lot of
information here you can see

452
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:02,480
all the common applications
that are installed

453
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,630
on the victims of your malware,

454
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,860
so you can know what are
the most common applications

455
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,729
that are installed and that
you should maybe imitate

456
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,483
or consider for your next attack.

457
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,920
Here you can see all the applications

458
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,210
that the malware is targeting.

459
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,820
And so today, you don't need
to know how the app looks like

460
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,860
you don't need to know
how to create an app

461
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,129
or anything like that.

462
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,510
You just need the money to
purchase the correct kit

463
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,870
that will provide you the option

464
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,070
to just tick the checkbox
on whatever application

465
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,139
you want to target.

466
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,060
And there it is, everything is ready.

467
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,847
So you have in the screen
all the overlay screens,

468
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,800
the applications that they are targeting

469
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,639
the credentials that they
are asking for, pretty good.

470
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,630
And here you can see the Bot details.

471
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,210
So bot details is actually
the victim details

472
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,070
and whatever victims that
fell for this attack.

473
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,889
You can see all of these details here.

474
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,000
It's really cool.

475
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,800
You can see he's platforms
the versions that he's using

476
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,479
consider things here.

477
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,570
And of course, you can see the credentials

478
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,566
that he has submitted so you can use them.

479
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:12,710
Another cool thing is
that you don't just get

480
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,290
the credentials and steal them,

481
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,000
you can also bypass the
two FA the two FA stage.

482
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,810
So the OTP, the one time
passcode and all that.

483
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,820
So what they actually do is
they intercept the text message

484
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,460
that is being sent to the user.

485
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,520
So once they get the credentials
and they obtain them,

486
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,320
they try to log in on their end,

487
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,668
the actor is trying to login on his end

488
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,889
to the legitimize application.

489
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,790
And then an SMS is sent
to the legitimate person

490
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,100
and the victim for you know,

491
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,810
to make sure that is
the legitimate person.

492
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,149
So what he can do is basically
he can control his device,

493
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,220
and you can lock his screen

494
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,160
and actually present
him this Android updates

495
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,603
completely fake screen
and the user is not aware

496
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:01,470
that's even got a text message.

497
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,800
You can use this device the
actor can use the user's device

498
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,010
and then delete it and there
it is the perfect fraud,

499
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,720
got the credentials data
to FA and make that frauds

500
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,680
and finished that.

501
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,980
So moving on, we talked
about COVID-19 changes

502
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,260
and we know that there
were a lot of threats

503
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,850
that are, they were being used before

504
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,449
but they have now advanced
and again taking advantage

505
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,240
of this fear and
everything is going around.

506
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,580
So we see a lot of ways to get out

507
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,060
graduate of Coronavirus
and stuff like that people

508
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,639
are falling for that course.

509
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,610
And one thing we see is
the Ginp Mobile Malware

510
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,000
that actually started
as just an SMS stealer

511
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,480
and has now advanced to target
a lot of banking applications

512
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,600
is basically reusing Anubis
code that that leaked earlier

513
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:54,230
this year, and now has the
capabilities of malware overlay

514
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,250
and additional more and
we're going to show you

515
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,340
what it looks like.

516
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,090
So they are actually trying to sell us

517
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,879
that this is an app that
will help them identify

518
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,210
who has the Coronavirus around them.

519
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,930
So if you can just pay a small amount,

520
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,580
and we will let you know
who was infected around you,

521
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,020
of course completely fake,

522
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,550
you enter your credit card credentials.

523
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,680
And there it is, they
just got your credentials,

524
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,770
and this is not the amount
that you're actually

525
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,690
going to lose, you're gonna
lose a significant more amount,

526
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,165
now that they can commit
the account takeover.

527
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,800
So we talked about all these threats

528
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,787
and everything looks really really scary.

529
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,960
But we can do a lot of
things to address that.

530
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,510
So one thing is to leverage
AI solutions and mechanism.

531
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,228
So if we talk about AI in
a really high level manner,

532
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:50,228
these are a lot of mechanisms
and engines that we can teach.

533
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,490
So for example, in this
slide, you can see the apples,

534
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,040
you provide the engine, the
apples and you tell them

535
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,100
these are apples.

536
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,419
So you teach that and then this machine

537
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,620
or this environment can identify

538
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,120
the next apple in line because
it's now familiar with that.

539
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,629
So this is a very high level of course.

540
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,220
But now let's talk about
how you can actually use

541
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,703
that to check out all the threats

542
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:19,320
that we talked about, or
at least some of them.

543
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,730
So for example, we talked
about Remote Access Attacks.

544
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,930
And we know for a fact that
you know, remote access,

545
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,950
the mouse movements will be
delayed, there is a short delay.

546
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,530
So for example, here, if
you take a look to the left,

547
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,930
you can see a regular mouse movement

548
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,660
or regular computer what it looks like

549
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,570
everything is very,
looks like almost a line,

550
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,149
very crowded lets go this way.

551
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,500
And if you look to the right,

552
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,630
you can see that the dots
are really not connected.

553
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,630
There is a significant delay
between the mouse movements

554
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,810
and this is one indication
that this is the person

555
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,740
that is using a different machine

556
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,740
or reusing a remote access
to the legitimate person.

557
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,870
Another thing you can do with AI

558
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,870
is you can actually compare
the code of phishing attacks

559
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,120
and see or potential phishing attacks

560
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,159
and see there, if there are things

561
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,810
that are you know, raising any flags.

562
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,889
So for example, this is a
hijacked website to the right,

563
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,160
this is the domain and on this domain,

564
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,453
you have the left the page to the left,

565
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:24,660
which is the full attack targeting

566
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,560
a significant targeted organization.

567
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,950
So, you can actually
understand that these themes

568
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,320
are very not related at all.

569
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,590
And if you have a legitimate
general site, you know,

570
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,649
that the theme will be very, very similar.

571
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,890
Another thing we can do is identify usage

572
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,410
of legitimate logos

573
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,350
so you can identify that
and that's, you know,

574
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,070
just the tip of the iceberg.

575
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,090
So if we talk about what we need to apply,

576
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,530
so for the next week,

577
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,550
you should start looking
for the blind spots

578
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,200
in your security process
and existing solutions.

579
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,167
There must be some of them and
you just need to take a look

580
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,620
and you know, do some brainstorming.

581
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,229
In the first three months
of this presentation,

582
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,640
you should assess the
threats of your organization

583
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,120
is likely to experience
and financial losses,

584
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,729
define a protection strategy
that will reduce cost

585
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,977
and friction to your clients,

586
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:22,370
you can, you know, get some
help from external companies

587
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,850
and services that's also really good to do

588
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,159
and within the six months,

589
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,350
you should select a seamless
omnichannel solution

590
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,820
based on AI and machine
learning with combination

591
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,639
of customized jurisdiction
rules of security protection.

592
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,418
So with the omnichannel here
is really a major thing.

593
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:42,889
We need to make sure that
the user journey in total

594
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,290
is you know, we are aware of
that and we will make sure

595
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,840
that we need to identify
this is the correct process

596
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,629
that is being done and no
one is trying to tackle that.

597
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,650
Another thing is just
to continue to assess

598
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,510
the average changing threat
landscape and associated risk

599
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,260
as you see it's constantly changing,

600
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,390
and we need to make sure
that we are up to speed

601
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,521
and are protecting our
employees and clients

602
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:09,649
and someone else.

603
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,720
So, I'm gonna wrap up right now.

604
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,720
This is our recommendations
and thank you for your time.
