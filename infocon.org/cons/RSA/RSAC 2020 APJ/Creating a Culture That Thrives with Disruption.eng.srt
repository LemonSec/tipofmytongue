1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,010
- Hello, my name is Charlene Li.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,779
I'm a New York times bestselling author,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,430
and also a senior analyst at Altimeter,

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,469
which is a profit company.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,940
Today, I'm gonna be talking about

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,710
how do you create a culture
that can thrive with disruption?

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,320
And this is such an
important issue right now,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,890
especially because
there's so much going on.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,570
There's one crisis after
another, there's chaos going on.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,170
So how do you create a team?

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,720
How do you create a culture

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,350
that can not only weather all the storms

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,270
that disruption could be throwing
at you, not just survive,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,180
but also thrive.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,240
So the reason why I love
the topic of disruption

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,440
is that I have made it
the purpose of my career

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,080
to help leaders and organizations
thrive with disruption.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,260
And my latest book, "The
Disruption Mindset."

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,670
What I found was that it's often times

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,610
thinking about disruption
in a different way.

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,100
Because we keep thinking
is it's something to avoid,

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,610
but actually it's disruption
that creates growth.

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,330
And especially now, disruption
is a huge opportunity

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,399
for change.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,030
When you see these
disruptions coming at you,

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,890
how do you look at it as
an opportunity to change,

27
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,270
an opportunity to grow?

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,670
There's a lot of research that shows that

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,250
during times of recessions,
times of setbacks,

30
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,110
that's when the next
generation of business leaders,

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,730
of business organizations
that are going to change

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,670
so many things, rewrite the rules.

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,840
This is the time when
those opportunities emerge.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,620
So when it comes to disruption
and creating that culture,

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,240
I think there's two types
of cultures to think about.

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,729
You may be in a culture
that is what I call stuck.

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,020
It tends to think this is a
way we've always done things.

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,630
And so we'll just keep doing that

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,020
'cause it's worked pretty
well for us in the past.

40
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,740
And people are pretty confident that

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,780
what's worked in the
past is gonna continue

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,428
to work that way.

43
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,810
But there is a different type of culture.

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,790
A culture that is what I
call flux culture thinking.

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,880
And these cultures think
very, very differently.

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,770
They constantly say to themselves,

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,500
there's got to be a better way.

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,070
They think that sharing
is where power comes from.

49
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,280
And they're going to do a lot of tests,

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,770
not to be proven right,
but to be proven wrong

51
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,760
and therefore they can then improve.

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,399
It's a completely
different way of thinking.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,470
And if you feel like you're
more in the stuck culture area

54
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,920
and you want to move to flux culture,

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,320
then you're going to have
to change your culture.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,380
And the way you do that
is to change your beliefs

57
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,320
and to change your behaviors

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,040
because that's all what culture is.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,280
Culture is simply the
behaviors and the beliefs

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,750
that your organization
believes in and acts on.

61
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,330
So I'm gonna go through today

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,810
and talk about how you actually do this.

63
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,450
How do you create a culture
that can be much more focused

64
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,602
on being disruptive.

65
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,710
My research has found that
there are three beliefs

66
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,510
of disruptive organizations,

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,899
of these organizations
that have a flux culture.

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,740
The first one is that
there's a belief of openness.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,010
That being more open is a great
way to create transparency

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,459
and accountability.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,680
It's all about trust.

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,940
And when you can have trust,
you can move so much faster

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,380
and with great speed and agility.

74
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,880
The second belief is of agency,

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,160
and this is the belief that
everybody in the organization

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,549
has the ability to act like an owner,

77
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,570
to take decisions, to own them.

78
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,510
And then therefore be focused
on doing the right thing.

79
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,109
But they're not empowered.

80
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,750
Nobody's giving them the power.

81
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,940
They already have the power

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,290
just by simply being a
member of the organization

83
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,920
and being (mumbles) about the strategy.

84
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,200
And the third belief is a bias for action.

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,369
There's a belief that
things are moving further

86
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,380
and further away from you.

87
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,220
Your customers are going so fast,

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,840
you gotta catch up to them.

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,890
There's no time to wait
around, to make things perfect.

90
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,079
You've got to act right now.

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
So I'm gonna go through each of these

92
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,630
and then talk about how you can create

93
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,549
and sustain an organization

94
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,060
with a cultural operating system.

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,570
But let's talk about
these three beliefs first,

96
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,519
and let's talk about openness first.

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,010
And openness is the ability
to encourage openness

98
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,680
to create again, that foundation of trust.

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,830
So when we think about being open,

100
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,520
there's a couple of reasons
why it's so important.

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,570
It is the very first
belief that I put out there

102
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,740
and observed in disruptive organizations.

103
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,600
First of all, openness
creates accountability.

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,580
And if you're trying to disrupt,

105
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,560
trying to create a huge
amount of change and growth,

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,770
and just do this at such a different level

107
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,520
than you've done in the past,

108
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,490
then when you sign up to do that,

109
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,140
you have to be able to say,
yeah, I'm gonna sign up for it

110
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,340
and you're gonna see all of my actions.

111
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,036
I'm going to take it on
and be accountable for it.

112
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:59,890
When there's openness and
transparency in an organization,

113
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,060
there's no place for anybody to hide.

114
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,387
It's not like you can go in and say,

115
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:08,387
"Oh yeah, I support your
disruptive process and strategy.

116
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,090
But I don't really."

117
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,510
So I'm gonna go back to my
office and sign back everything.

118
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,969
I'm going to just not try my best

119
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,970
because I really don't believe in it.

120
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,350
When you have openness
that doesn't happen.

121
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,730
And so, it forces difficult conversations.

122
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,227
You can go up to somebody and say,

123
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:29,060
"Hey, because we have
transparency, because we're open,

124
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,900
I see that you're not
showing up these meetings.

125
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,929
You're not giving your all.

126
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,620
What's going on?

127
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,680
Is there a issue with the strategy?

128
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,410
What's going on?

129
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,220
And especially now, because
disruption is so hard,

130
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,080
it's very important that we are set up

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,159
to have these difficult conversations.

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,930
And openness provides you
the data, the information,

133
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,160
the platform to have those conversations.

134
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,740
It also removes the fear of failure

135
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,000
because well, everybody can see
that is not working for you.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,870
And what better way to ask for help

137
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,620
than for people to see it's not working.

138
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,720
And instead of you
having to raise your hand

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,290
and say like, "Oh, I didn't make it.

140
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,220
It didn't work.

141
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm failing."

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,180
People can see that it's not working

143
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,680
and they will come to you and
say, "I see, it's not working.

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,970
I think I may have a solution."

145
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,070
That's a much better way.

146
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,599
This is the way that
disruptive organizations work.

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,900
And then finally, it's a great opportunity

148
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,599
for a diverse group of
people to come together

149
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,020
because you don't know
who has the right ideas,

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,330
who has the ability to help
you fix these problems,

151
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,330
to disrupt the problem that
you're trying to solve.

152
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,849
So when you can have a lot more openness,

153
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,840
you have a lot more information
sharing and decision making

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,049
so that everyone in the organization,

155
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,520
regardless of their background,

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,830
regardless of where they work
in geography or time zone,

157
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,710
or even what level they are,

158
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,443
anybody can contribute to that problem.

159
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,167
So I love this saying from Risto Siilasmaa

160
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,000
who was a chairman of Nokia.

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,540
He led Nokia through this huge transition

162
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,490
when they sold off the handsets

163
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,430
and moved into the internet
communications telecom space.

164
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,980
He says, "No news is bad news."

165
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,750
When there's nothing happening,
we're hearing nothing.

166
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,420
That's not good.

167
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,530
Our bad news is actually good news

168
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,419
because now we know what to do.

169
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,120
We know what to fix
and we can focus on it.

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,800
And good news is, well, it's no news.

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,170
We're not gonna celebrate good news.

172
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,690
Good news means that
it's working, so great.

173
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,800
Let's move on now.

174
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,820
Let's focus on the things
that aren't working

175
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,280
and making sure we have
that culture of openness

176
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,609
so that we can make sure
that we're communicating

177
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,173
and sharing information at
the level we need to be.

178
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
So couple of ways to create
openness in your organization.

179
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,400
First of all, determine
how open you need to be,

180
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,609
how much trust you need in
your team to be able to share

181
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,050
and use information to make decisions.

182
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,560
This is the fundamental question.

183
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,690
How open do you need to be?

184
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,960
Well, figure out how much
trust needs to be there.

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,370
And especially if there are
places where trust is low,

186
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,960
this is the place where you
really want to address it

187
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,039
with openness.

188
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,510
If trust is not happening
because of past experiences

189
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,820
or personal difficulties,
or personalities are strong,

190
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,810
whatever the reason may be,

191
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,530
being much more open in those
areas, in those circumstances

192
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,119
with those people,

193
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,340
is going to push you to
greater communications

194
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,722
in a way to build trust.

195
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,539
And also I do believe
that making more data,

196
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,719
more information available
is a great stepping stone.

197
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,150
I was speaking to one CEO
and she was sharing that

198
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,159
they realize that only the top executives

199
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,959
in the organization had
access to all of the rich data

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,180
and analysis.

201
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,109
And they ask themselves,

202
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,460
especially as the shutdown
was happening with COVID,

203
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,790
why can't we make this
information available to anybody?

204
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,740
When they looked at it,

205
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,910
they're like there's nothing
confidential in here.

206
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,089
There's no reason why we're getting it.

207
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,540
So they made like 97% or
so of their information

208
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,110
inside their firewall in the intranet

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,720
that was not previously
available, available to anybody.

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,740
They didn't wanna put any
barrier between somebody

211
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,283
and the information that they
could use to do their job.

212
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,460
And the last area is to start using

213
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,740
all of the fantastic collaboration
tools that are out there,

214
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,660
especially if you're a
leader and you're there

215
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,569
to make sure that people are collaborating

216
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,830
and communicating.

217
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,170
This is not a platform for everybody else,

218
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,469
and not you as a leader.

219
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,310
It's really important
that you get into there

220
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,479
and demonstrate, be a role
model for what sharing

221
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,413
and decision making in an
open environment looks like.

222
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,607
So that's openness.

223
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,459
I want to talk about agency,

224
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,100
which is where you give
employees the agency

225
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,990
to act like owners.

226
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,030
And as I was mentioning
before, this is very different

227
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,949
from being empowered

228
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,270
because one of the biggest barriers

229
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,630
we found in organizations that are trying

230
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,957
to be more disruptive is
that people kept saying,

231
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:11,060
"I don't have the permission.

232
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,002
I don't have the approval
to go out and do this thing

233
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,620
that I think needs to be done."

234
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,170
But yeah, if you have strong
agency in an organization

235
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,969
where everyone understands
what the strategy is,

236
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,500
what does a job to be done?

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,150
What are our objectives?

238
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,920
Then there's a lot of trust.

239
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,150
There's a lot of agency
in the organization

240
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,840
that somebody is gonna say
like, "I know what can be done.

241
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,200
And I have that power.

242
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,170
I have the permission to
be able to go do this."

243
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,020
So I don't need to go find
that stamp of approval

244
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,829
to have that happen.

245
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,750
Now, a couple of things that happen

246
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,570
inside many organizations
is what I call HIPPO.

247
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,230
It stands for Highest
Paid Person's Opinion.

248
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,740
And this is something that leaders

249
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,950
have to constantly fight against.

250
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,150
And that is because you
are the most senior person

251
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,069
in the room, everyone's going to assume

252
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,950
that you have the answer

253
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,550
and that your answer is
gonna be the right one.

254
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,650
And if you are that HIPPO in the room,

255
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,720
we have to make sure
that that doesn't happen.

256
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,300
And that the agency in
the room resides with

257
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,140
every single person.

258
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,910
Because the minute your organization,

259
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,459
your team defaults to HIPPO,
people's agency are taken away.

260
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,770
They do not feel like
they have the ability

261
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,689
to act like owners because
frankly, the HIPPO is the owner.

262
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,110
So it's a very important process,

263
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,000
that if you want to create agency,

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
it starts with you as a leader

265
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,700
to make sure that you
are encouraging people

266
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,603
to step up and own the
agency they already have.

267
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,010
So I wanna give one example from Amazon.

268
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,730
They have two wonderful principles

269
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,290
that really points to this.

270
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,579
One of the first ones that
they have is this plain out

271
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,030
called ownership.

272
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,100
They believe that every single
leader in the organization

273
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,760
and by the way, they believe
that every single employee

274
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,030
at Amazon is a leader, has a
potential of being a leader.

275
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,050
So there's a very strong
sense that everybody

276
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,666
can be an owner of what's
going on in their work.

277
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,460
And the other one is this
idea of having backbone,

278
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,170
disagreeing and committing.

279
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,469
There's an obligation that
when you come to the table

280
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,500
to make a decision, you're going to fight

281
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,080
and fight really hard for
what you think is right.

282
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,770
And you're welcome to disagree.

283
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,530
In fact, we encourage people to disagree

284
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,140
because that's how we're going
to get to a better solution.

285
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,140
But when that decision is
made, once we have decided

286
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,770
all the various options, and
we've picked this one option,

287
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,210
this is going to be the
one way we move forward.

288
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,320
There's no second guessing at this point.

289
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,600
At that point, we need
everybody, 100% committed.

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,640
And in fact, if you were
the person who was arguing

291
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,670
with just the exact opposites,
even more important for you

292
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,120
to show up and commit and
say, "I disagreed with this,

293
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,400
but let's go through and make sure that

294
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,970
this is the best executed
solution that we can have."

295
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,797
That way, nobody can
ever look back and say,

296
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:05,200
"Maybe it was the execution
that didn't happen."

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,790
No, we know that everybody
executed 100% against us

298
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,622
committed.

299
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,610
And it was the idea that wasn't right.

300
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,450
So this idea of disagree and commit

301
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,320
is one of the hardest things
I see organizations doing,

302
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,030
either because they don't want to disagree

303
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,790
because it might hurt people's feelings.

304
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,599
And so you go down to the
lowest common denominator

305
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,310
and you compromise and you don't come up

306
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,920
with the best solution.

307
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,219
Or there's a lot of argument.

308
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,790
There's a lot of going back and forth

309
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,699
and people just feel bad
so they don't commit.

310
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,950
Having this as one of your cultural values

311
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,800
is incredibly important
to be able to move through

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,782
these tough times and move fast.

313
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,670
So some ways to instill agency,

314
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,939
demonstrate that you trust people.

315
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,750
They may not feel
comfortable making a decision

316
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,350
so you want to shift that
ownership and authority over time.

317
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,670
Have them come to the
table with the solutions.

318
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,490
Next time, come to the table
of solutions and pick one.

319
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,220
Next time, come with it with solutions,

320
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,603
and also the work plan.

321
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:06,880
You see this progression
that you can give people,

322
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,860
that sense of ownership and responsibility

323
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,823
and accountability.

324
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
One of the best ways you
can create agency also

325
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,980
is to learn how to fail with grace.

326
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,670
How are you going to allow people to fail?

327
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,910
In fact, encourage people to fail.

328
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,079
And then make sure that the
forgiveness is absolute.

329
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
They're 100% there.

330
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,479
And the goal of failing
is so that we can learn

331
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
and do better the next time.

332
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,890
Make sure you simplify decision-making.

333
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,610
I talked to one CFO
and after the workshop,

334
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,160
he basically stood up in front
of the entire organization

335
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,680
and said, you see these eight
different types of approvals

336
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,890
I've had to do in the past,
don't need them anymore.

337
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,949
I always approve them anyways,
you guys are coming to me

338
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,530
with the best proposals.

339
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't need to be part of this.

340
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,189
We're to simplify everything.

341
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,560
And then finally make
sure that you are clear

342
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,760
when that disagreement is expected

343
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,840
and you really wanna encourage it.

344
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,450
And also when it's time to move on.

345
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,200
When we've moved past
that point of exploration,

346
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,323
it's now time for execution.

347
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,420
So that's agency and openness.

348
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,750
Now we want to talk about bias for action.

349
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,030
And that's embracing the speed,

350
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,110
this a bias for action to again,

351
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,610
chase after those opportunities
that are being created

352
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,370
by disruption.

353
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,560
And what I found is that organizations

354
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,609
with a really strong bias for action,

355
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,976
have these behaviors.

356
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,170
(mumbles) off from that belief.

357
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,540
They embrace done is better than perfect.

358
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,980
You've may have seen this.

359
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,330
But the idea is by the time
you figure out perfect,

360
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,610
the opportunity is gone.

361
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,300
So let's just get it done.

362
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,469
They make decisions with
what I think is called

363
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,090
a really valuable idea
called minimally viable data.

364
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,620
As soon as you have enough data to be able

365
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,230
to decide option A is
better than option B,

366
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,010
then you go with option A.

367
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,340
And you realize that even
if that's the wrong decision

368
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,100
in the end, you're better
off having figured that out

369
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,090
and coming back very quickly
and finding another way.

370
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,640
The reality is 90% of the decisions,

371
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,949
even 99% of the decisions
that you make are reversible.

372
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,790
So let's go for it, try and figure out,

373
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,930
put it into the market, put
it in the hands of people

374
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,000
who will actually used
that product or service

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,830
and then figure it out.

376
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,410
And the other thing is to really be clear

377
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,000
about the next steps and
deadlines that you have.

378
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,650
How often is it going to be?

379
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,260
Are you going to meet again in two weeks?

380
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,340
Because that's the way you always meet?

381
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,910
Or will you meet again in two hours?

382
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,800
Because that's how long it
takes to actually do that work.

383
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,219
Disruptive organization
streak that cycle time.

384
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,470
They don't do it based
on people's availability,

385
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,000
they do it based on the
work that needs to be done.

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So if it takes two weeks or two days,

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,420
then that's how long it
takes to get that work done

388
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,252
to the next phase.

389
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,880
But I hope that you make these
psychos as short as possible

390
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,020
so that you can figure out very quickly

391
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,290
whether it's going to work or not.

392
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,500
So I just give a quick example here

393
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,470
of Southern New Hampshire University.

394
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,820
This is university, guess where?

395
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,520
It's in Southern New Hampshire

396
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,990
and there a small 3,000 person campus

397
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,540
and about 150,000 students online.

398
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,569
The president, Paul
LeBlanc, had very early on,

399
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,970
decided that he was going to
make everything student-focused

400
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,619
and set up a separate organization

401
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,419
that could have the
flexibility and the ability

402
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,859
to be able to act very quickly.

403
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,339
And one example of that
is they had a chance

404
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,830
to buy a nearby university
and they had five days

405
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,189
to make the decision.

406
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,010
When the call came with this opportunity,

407
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,840
that afternoon, they had a
team at that other university,

408
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,179
the next day, they had
done a full entire audit

409
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,750
of what the opportunity was.

410
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,200
And on the fourth day they
had a proposal on the table.

411
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Now, most organizations, even
if they're not for profits

412
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,630
could never even come close to this.

413
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,200
Even for profit companies,
couldn't do this.

414
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
But because they were
engineered for that speed,

415
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,919
for that bias for action,

416
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,490
they had the cross functional
teams that were set up

417
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,600
to be disruptive with any
opportunity that came available.

418
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,572
They were able to close
this deal just in five days.

419
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,600
So a couple of ways to
instill this belief,

420
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,449
make sure you're understanding

421
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,180
what is your capacity for change?

422
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,870
In particular, understand how strong it is

423
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,949
and then slowly keep increasing it.

424
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,700
This is something you train for.

425
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,600
It is something that
you develop over time.

426
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,800
If your action timeframes are much longer,

427
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,000
start trying to string them.

428
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,710
Making sure that your
employees have what I call

429
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,580
extra sensory skill.

430
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,560
That means everybody is
out there looking to see

431
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,230
and understand what your
customers are doing.

432
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,760
And then you have a way to
process that up and then be able

433
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,740
to make decisions on
that very, very quickly.

434
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,560
And I think the last thing
that I want to just say

435
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,440
is forcing impossible deadlines

436
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,930
is a really good way to do this.

437
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,640
Because it removes that that
ability to make things perfect.

438
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,110
It forces you to have to
make all these compromises

439
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,340
about things and really focus
on the most important decision

440
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,000
and data that you need to
have to make that decision.

441
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,430
That's the magic of minimally viable data.

442
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,990
What is the minimal amount of information

443
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,993
to be able to take that next step.

444
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,677
So if you're thinking about
these beliefs of openness agency

445
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:30,350
and a bias for action, think
about your own organization.

446
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,540
What are the beliefs that are holding

447
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,100
your organization back?

448
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,889
And here are some of the things
that I've heard from people.

449
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,724
Some people say I can't
speak up, I might get fired.

450
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,840
It's very dangerous to be able to speak up

451
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,409
and say something.

452
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,740
We need more data to be 100% sure

453
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,680
'cause we have to be 100% right.

454
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,570
We have to be perfect.

455
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,929
I love this fourth one,
I can't change anything.

456
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,760
I'm just a, and you can fill in the blank.

457
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,440
I heard this from people
saying I'm just a person

458
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,510
in the front lines doing
the work with our customers.

459
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,670
I'm just a manager.

460
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm just VP.

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,167
I'm just the CEO.

462
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm just a board member.

463
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,500
I've heard this one every single
role, every single person.

464
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,910
And this is a really dangerous thing

465
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,360
because it says we don't have the agency.

466
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,800
We don't believe that any of us

467
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,730
can make a difference and a change.

468
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,427
Be able to flip that and say,
anybody can make a change

469
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:25,263
and a difference is a
fundamental change in the belief.

470
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,560
Transmission isn't my job.

471
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
And then again, there's
always the agreement,

472
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,740
consensus approach.

473
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,180
We can't move forward
unless everybody agrees.

474
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,020
And that's such a dangerous place to be

475
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,970
because does everybody
really need to agree

476
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,010
for us to move forward.

477
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,173
Are we that fragile as an organization

478
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,370
that we need to believe that?

479
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,620
The key here is to test,

480
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,699
every single one of these assumptions.

481
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,350
And as a group decide
which of these things

482
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,000
are holding us back.

483
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
And then decide, and
literally put them on the wall

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,149
and say, we're not going to
believe these things anymore.

485
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,180
And they said, put up on another wall,

486
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,140
the beliefs that are
going to move us forward.

487
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,600
What are we gonna say to each other?

488
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,209
How are we going to act
differently to be able to do that?

489
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,840
There are tools to do this very quickly.

490
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,300
I would encourage you
to do a culture audit.

491
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,270
This is an example from
an assignment that I did

492
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,470
with a recent client.

493
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,940
And we asked them what behaviors
have held the company back

494
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,773
through the years.

495
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:25,659
And they were able to do
in open-ended results.

496
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,590
So this is a participant, I
think, 89 people, 62 answers,

497
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,290
almost a thousand votes.

498
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,060
And you can see this charting
this over in terms of,

499
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,919
is it a consensus and how popular is this?

500
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,480
And these tools like
this, and this technology

501
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,680
allows you to be able to do
that really quick culture audit.

502
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,150
What are the beliefs
that are holding us back?

503
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,800
How do we move forward from them?

504
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,850
So I wanna talk very quickly
of flux operating system.

505
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,160
And the flux operating system
consists of structure, process

506
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,890
and what I call lore.

507
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,540
I'm gonna go through
these things very quickly.

508
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,670
And structure just says, how
do we ingrain our beliefs

509
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,410
in the organization?

510
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,450
At ING Bank in The Netherlands,

511
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,580
they developed something
called the Orange Code.

512
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,030
These are the fundamental
behaviors and beliefs

513
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,110
that they have,

514
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,490
and they changed the
organizational structure too.

515
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,950
They went to complete agile.

516
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,150
They tore apart the entire
departmental structure

517
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,930
in their headquarters, in The Netherlands,

518
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,690
and put everybody into
cross-functional teams.

519
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,590
So every team had engineering,
had finance, had marketing,

520
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,090
had product development,
focused on customers.

521
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,530
And so they use the Orange
Code as a foundation

522
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,760
for the structure, and
they use the structure

523
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,660
as a way to reinforce the code.

524
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,870
Another company, this is from
Telstra down in Australia

525
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,870
and the former CEO posted this
thing onto their intranet.

526
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,870
And said, "Please tell
us your top time wasting

527
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,100
and unnecessary approvals or processes.

528
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,560
We must be more efficient and
reduce unproductive work."

529
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,080
It's a little bit hard to see here,

530
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,449
but there were almost
800 different responses

531
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,450
that came back to this post.

532
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,940
And that was only in the first hour.

533
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,550
So David Thodey and his team
had to go back and figure out,

534
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,409
well, which of these processes
are we going to keep or not,

535
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,020
and slashed a bunch of them
and agreed in this post

536
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,450
that, yeah, we don't know why that exists,

537
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,040
but this process is really
important for these reasons.

538
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,120
Think about what that did.

539
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,719
It opened up the communications.

540
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,020
It demonstrated openness on
the part of the organization

541
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
and leadership.

542
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,407
It created agency on the part of people

543
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:37,600
and a bias for action.

544
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,669
Like we gotta get this done.

545
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,470
So this is how process
could be used to again,

546
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,560
reinforce that belief.

547
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,360
And then my favorite area is lore.

548
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,840
We have rituals, we
have symbols and stories

549
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,179
that really go back into the lore,

550
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,810
the sort of soft aspects of the culture.

551
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,169
But these are extremely important,
and you can design these.

552
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,230
I'll give an example
that I think many of you

553
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,110
are familiar with.

554
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,830
This is the New Zealand rugby team.

555
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,340
They do something called the Haka.

556
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,669
This amazing dance at the very beginning

557
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,190
of each of their matches.

558
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,970
It's incredibly unifying for the team,

559
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,110
very intimidating to the other team.

560
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,580
But it also creates a sense of belonging.

561
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,610
And that's what rituals do.

562
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,830
Instead of feeling like
an individual and outcast,

563
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,260
we go through this rituals.

564
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,210
And especially if they're meaningful.

565
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,040
If they're built back into
the beliefs of openness,

566
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,260
of agency, of bias for action,

567
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,330
the ritual has become even
more imbued with that meaning

568
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,883
and create that sense of belonging.

569
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,040
Like LinkedIn, they have
this ritual every year

570
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,210
called Bring your parents to work day

571
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,060
and I love this because it says,

572
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,129
who are the most important
people in your life?

573
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,350
Well, your parents, but
do they know what you do?

574
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,142
And so the workers bringing
their parents work.

575
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,750
They actually see it, their
parents see what's going on

576
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,620
in the workplace, understand
the mission of LinkedIn.

577
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,639
And then therefore, when
you are having a bad day,

578
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,147
well guess what you do,
you call your parents

579
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,850
and they go, yeah, I know it's a bad day,

580
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,290
but you work for a great company.

581
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,680
So these are rituals again, that reinforce

582
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,460
what are the things that are meaningful?

583
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,310
Here's an example of a symbol.

584
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,500
This is from Oxo.

585
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,770
They make household
goods and kitchen goods.

586
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,150
And when you walk into
the New York office,

587
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,060
you see this beautiful
wall filled with gloves.

588
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,050
Employees are asked to
go find these gloves

589
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,470
just on the streets of New York,

590
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,860
wash them and bring them
in, and they hang them up.

591
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,240
And it's to represent the hands

592
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,810
that they make the products for.

593
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,270
Their big hands, so small
holds hands, young hands,

594
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,360
old hands, arthritic hands.

595
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,149
And the hands again, remind people

596
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,300
as they're walking in to the office,

597
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,649
who are we doing this for?

598
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,680
And who are the focus of all
the work we're trying to do?

599
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,030
And then stories are just so rich.

600
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,593
This is again, one of my
favorite stories is from 3M.

601
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,870
At the invention of the Post-it notes.

602
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,050
And these are the two engineers

603
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,950
who actually created the Post-it notes.

604
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,830
One person had a glue that
just didn't work that well,

605
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,189
it was a failure.

606
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,580
And the other one had a
problem where they were trying

607
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,899
to keep pages and pieces
of paper in a handle

608
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,960
for his choir practices.

609
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,330
And they met, they talked about it.

610
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,470
They figured this out.

611
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,280
They thought it was great,

612
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,680
but the leadership didn't like it.

613
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,440
They thought this was a stupid idea.

614
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,210
So they made a batch and
they put up on the desk

615
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,380
of every single assistant
for the senior executives.

616
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,830
And when they ran out, they
kept asking the bosses,

617
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,610
where are these things, we
love them, give us more.

618
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,889
And that's how they were
able to break through.

619
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,790
So what are the stories that you have

620
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,090
inside of your organization?

621
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,459
What are the stories
that you can tell people,

622
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,250
tell each other, that
reinforce the beliefs

623
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,170
that you want to have to move you forward.

624
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,650
So a couple of last
action steps to close out.

625
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,820
First of all, audit your beliefs.

626
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,210
What are your formal beliefs?

627
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,490
What are your informal beliefs.

628
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,470
How have they changed?

629
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:00,330
Are they working for you or
are they holding you back?

630
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,710
And then review and look
at your purpose statement,

631
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,850
because this is the statement that says,

632
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,770
this is why we come together.

633
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,900
Hopefully you have a
good purpose statement.

634
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,460
It's not buried someplace.

635
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,640
And hopefully also you're
starting to use it.

636
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,390
You're using it as a
place to come together

637
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,490
to create that unity of
purpose and objectives.

638
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,990
Take a look at your operating system,

639
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,630
which of these things need to be tweaked?

640
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,650
Is it your rituals?

641
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,900
Is it your structure, your
process, the stories you tell?

642
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,770
And then finally include
a cultural review.

643
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,290
Include a cultural review
at your next executive

644
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,850
or leadership retreat.

645
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,120
This has to be on your agenda.

646
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,070
I know there are so many things

647
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,909
that are pressing on your agenda,

648
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,470
but checking in, doing that audit,

649
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,980
understanding where
you're stand as a culture

650
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,790
and what needs to be fixed,
what needs to be addressed.

651
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,300
Because the one thing I've seen

652
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,480
is that you could have a great strategy,

653
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,270
but if you don't have
your culture aligned up

654
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,960
and well-tuned, culture is the engine.

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,010
If strategy is the road that says,

656
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,700
this is the road we're going to go about

657
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,370
to achieve our objectives.

658
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,080
Then the engine, your
culture, determines how fast

659
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,570
you're gonna go down road.

660
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,080
And you want your culture,
your culture engine,

661
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,092
to be as finely tuned as possible.

662
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,870
My last point for today is
that this is a hard job to do.

663
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,909
Disruption is incredibly difficult,

664
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,260
and I wish I could tell you it was easy.

665
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,800
But I can tell you, you will know

666
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,720
that you're doing it right

667
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,070
if you are living outside
of your comfort zone.

668
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,490
If you're living at that very edge,

669
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,410
because this is what disruption means.

670
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,850
Disruption means being able
to push out to the edges

671
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,230
of your capabilities.

672
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,130
Because until you push, you
won't know where that edge is,

673
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,863
and it's at that edge
where the magic happens.

674
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,080
So I encourage you and
wish you the best of luck

675
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,320
on your journey.
