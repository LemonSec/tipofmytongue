6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,420
I know like to turn it over

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,563
to Hamed Merati and William
Mouton for the presentation.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,180
- Hi, welcome everybody
joining our little presentation

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,260
on passwords.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,137
My name is William Mouton.

11
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,553
I'm the Head of Research at

12
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:36,879
a company called Sense of Security.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,660
We're part of the CyberCX
group in Australia.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,260
My colleague Hamed Merati is also

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,293
a senior security consultant
at Sense of Security.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,600
At this point, I would
just like to say thank you

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,313
for listening to yet
another talk on passwords.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,100
Passwords have been around
since the dawn of computers.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,700
It's been discussed, well
discussed, complained about

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,140
and this talk is not
gonna be about the merits

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,140
of whether passwords is
still relevant or secure

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,223
or anything like that.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,640
Today, we just wanna discuss our findings

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,090
and data that we've analyzed
during the course of

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,970
the assessments that we do.

26
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,200
At Sense of Security we do quite
a number of different types

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,710
of security assessments, and
we would like to take you guys

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,369
through what we've seen over
the last couple of years,

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,010
and how we can use that
to hopefully improve

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,653
the general state of
passwords in the industry.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,300
Passwords are still
basically the de facto means

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,840
of authentication.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,220
It's used everywhere from
small online retailers

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,390
to some of the biggest
corporates in the world.

35
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,230
And generally, relies on user generated

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,523
or choosing values.

37
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:56,929
And the funny thing is, in today's world,

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,430
the average user has more credentials

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,883
than ever before in history.

40
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:05,360
So like I said, we do different types

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,430
of security assessments and
we usually play the role

42
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,039
of the attacker, and
we take full advantage

43
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,950
of the fact that there are
general weaknesses within

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,512
the whole concept of passwords.

45
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,140
So, at this point, like I said,

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,790
passwords have been around a long time,

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,030
it's been discussed over
and over and over again,

48
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,690
over the last 20 to 30 years.

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,660
There's been various pieces
of advice given out over

50
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,320
the years from length, complexity.

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I like to typically use this
little XKCD image that kind

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,730
of explains where we are today in terms

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,730
of generating random complex passwords.

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,320
But the thing is, it's
not really worked out

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,269
the way we wanted it to work out.

56
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,610
Breaches still happen every day.

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,530
Password-based breaches
are probably one of

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,560
the most common types of
breaches that happen over

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,860
and over and over again.

60
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,010
And that's why we decided
to take a little bit

61
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,480
of a look, not just at
the passwords themselves,

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,130
the common passwords things like that,

63
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,350
but also password policies,

64
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,630
what do corporates put in
place to try and remedy this?

65
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,579
And where do they stand and the data kind

66
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,490
of surprised us a little bit because,

67
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,250
we had some preconceived conceptions

68
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,383
of what it should look like.

69
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,500
Because typically, we tend
to look at assessments

70
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,660
on a session by session basis.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,200
But what we've done is, for
the purpose of this talk,

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,130
we've taken the last
three years worth of data

73
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,220
that we've collected via various
types of penetration tests,

74
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,220
from our red teams, network
pentests, web applications,

75
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,920
every way that we could actually go in

76
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,739
and get access to large
sets of password data.

77
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,210
Typically, those would be in the form

78
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,720
of a compromised Microsoft
Active Directory,

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,070
because that's the most common
piece of technology used,

80
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,245
across large corporates, and we set out,

81
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,100
Our initial goal was just to look at,

82
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,290
what do passwords look like.

83
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,530
But we quickly realized that it goes far

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,110
beyond just the passwords.

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,410
There's a lot of user behavior.

86
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,760
And we started looking at

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,829
how does corporate password
policies drive user behavior?

88
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,649
And what influence that
has, whether a strong

89
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,673
or weak password policy
actually have an impact

90
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:26,013
on the behavior of users when
choosing different passwords.

91
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,890
So at this point, Hamed is
going to take you guys through

92
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,483
a little bit of the password policies.

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,469
- Yes, so within our industry,

94
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,250
we have four different
major industry guidelines,

95
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,640
the guidelines and standards.

96
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,150
So NIST, CIS benchmark and
Australian Cybersecurity Center

97
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,669
Information Security Manual or ACSCISM,

98
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,670
which is a Australian
government benchmark and PCI DSS

99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,870
So when we were going through our data

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,100
and we start analysis of the data,

101
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,450
we saw that most of the organization

102
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,760
because they using
Windows Active Directory,

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,130
so most of the organization

104
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,620
are using the windows
recommendation and values

105
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,390
as their recommendation.

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,140
So that's why we included
Microsoft in our analysis as well.

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,140
So just a quick walkthrough
over the different terms

108
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,150
of the password policy.

109
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,419
So we have things like
minimum password length,

110
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,270
which is the minimum
number of characters that

111
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,524
when you choose a password,
you have to comply with that.

112
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:43,940
If it's eight minimum characters,
so your password should

113
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,810
be at least minimum eight characters.

114
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,360
So the complexity it means
that whether you are allowed

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
to only have numbers in your passwords,

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,349
or is just lowercase, uppercase.

117
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,310
So if the complexity is enabled you have

118
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,310
to have a uppercase lowercase
or a numeric in your password.

119
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,700
The next parameter is
the password history.

120
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,200
So basically what it means is the number

121
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
of previous passwords
that the user has used,

122
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
so they cannot use.

123
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,349
For instance, if it's 24,

124
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,940
the value of the password history is 24,

125
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,332
the users cannot select
or choose the last,

126
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:24,483
the previous 20 passwords
of their own, and they have

127
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,841
to come up with a new one.

128
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,230
The next one is the maximum age

129
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,490
or the password expiry in days.

130
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,260
So for instance, if the
password policy has 90 days

131
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,200
of the maximum age or the password expiry,

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,260
it means that each three
months or after 90 days,

133
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,200
the users have to change the
password so they get a pop up,

134
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,610
which says that your password
is expired and you have

135
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,970
to change your password.

136
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,830
And the next two parameters
are lockout threshold

137
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,380
and lockout duration.

138
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,570
So lockout threshold means
that after so many or

139
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,969
these many failed attempts, your account

140
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,300
or the user account get locked.

141
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,580
So if it's 10, so you have
only 10 failed attempts.

142
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,330
So after that your account is locked

143
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,840
and the duration means for how long or

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,719
for how long your password
or your account is locked.

145
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,930
So if it's 15 minutes
of the lockout duration,

146
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,367
it means that once your account is locked,

147
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,810
you cannot try for the next 15 minutes.

148
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,220
So you have to wait for 15 minutes

149
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,070
and then you can have the next chart.

150
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:27,390
So the Microsoft what they recommend

151
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,900
for the minimum password then is to have

152
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,979
a eight character password,
complexity is enabled,

153
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,980
the password history is 24,
the maximum page or the expiry

154
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,040
is 42 days, which is a
week more than a month

155
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,420
so it's five weeks, and the
lockout threshold is 10 attempts

156
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,880
and the lockout duration
is if I'm not mistaken,

157
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,500
is 15 minutes.

158
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,500
For the NIST, they don't
really set any restrictions

159
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,740
and what they recommend is to have

160
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,970
a minimum password minimum password length

161
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,170
of eight characters

162
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,810
And there are different
parameters involved here.

163
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,060
Like, they don't say you have
to have the complexity enabled

164
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,580
or disabled, and they don't
force, or they recommend not

165
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,580
to force the users to
expire the password every

166
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,700
like one months, two
months or three months.

167
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,840
So what they recommend is

168
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,010
as long as your password
is not compromised,

169
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,219
and it's a strong password,

170
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,500
you are good to use that
password for as long as you can.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,312
And the next one CIS, which has

172
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:34,880
the highest minimum password
character length which is 14,

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,893
and ISM and PCI DSS.

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,280
So we use this as our guidelines

175
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,089
where we started our
analysis and what we saw was,

176
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,670
so this is the password policy.

177
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,729
So what we saw was 41%
of the organization,

178
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,330
they have a minimum eight characters as

179
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,160
the minimum password length, followed by

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,992
the seven characters.

181
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:03,770
So altogether about 63%
of the organization,

182
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,817
they have the bare minimum
of the password length.

183
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,260
So it means that if you
set a default and not

184
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,740
a good password policy,
most of the organization,

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,270
they don't bother to
increase that minimum.

186
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,530
And most of the users as we see

187
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,240
in the next few slides,

188
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,010
they just follow the bare minimum.

189
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,170
So it's very important to
have a very good baseline

190
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,290
because most of the organization

191
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,040
and the user they don't
change that behavior.

192
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,250
And based on our data,
the average minimum factor

193
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,690
for the passport across the
different organization is 8.1,

194
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,253
which is again to the minimum recommended.

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,890
And what was very
interesting was that 43% of

196
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,340
the organization, they are
aligned with Microsoft and NIST,

197
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,820
and 22% aligned with
PCI DSS and Microsoft,

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,330
followed by ASM and
interestingly, only 1% are aligned

199
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,330
with CIS which has the most
lengthy password length.

200
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,290
And for the password history,
46% of the organization

201
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,699
they have the 24 password
as the password history

202
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,980
and 46% of the organization
they are aligned with Microsoft

203
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,980
and CIS benchmark, 29% with
ICM and 8% with PCI DSS

204
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,022
and the rest but they
have different values.

205
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,600
And in terms of the lockout duration,

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,770
almost half of the organization they have

207
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,910
a minimum 30 minutes lockout duration.

208
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,520
So it means that if
your account is locked,

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,280
you have 30 minutes to
wait and then you can try

210
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,490
and attempt more.

211
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,330
So what is really interesting in this case

212
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,630
is if you have a short lockout duration,

213
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,720
it gives a good opportunity
for the attackers

214
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,910
to perform the brute force

215
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,219
or password guess much more faster,

216
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,700
so they don't need to wait for two hours,

217
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,700
three hours or whatever the
duration is to try and attack.

218
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,500
So they have shorter windows,
so they can attack faster.

219
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,990
And 61% of the organization,
they align with PCI DSS,

220
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,233
60% with CIS and the rest
they have different values.

221
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,750
And same with thresholds
as I mentioned earlier

222
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,970
that threshold is the
number of failed attempts

223
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,770
and 60% of the organization we see

224
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,540
they have five failed attempts

225
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,189
and 24% or almost a quarter
of the organization,

226
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,750
they have zero as the value.

227
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,650
So zero means that there is no lockout,

228
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,560
So and it means that the
attacker, or we as a tester,

229
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,760
we have unlimited number of times to try

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,468
and get a password or to attempt to crack,

231
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,333
to brute force the password.

232
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,689
And 36% of the organization
they're aligned with ISM,

233
00:11:55,213 --> 00:12:00,173
only 13% align with Microsoft
and CIS 9%, with PCI DSS

234
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:04,393
the standard and 42% they have different,

235
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,089
or it could be unlimited.

236
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,580
And password complexity
is very straightforward.

237
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,840
80% of the organization they do have

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,400
a password complexity set.

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,939
So the users need to have a complexity

240
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,220
in their passwords, like
password one with capital P

241
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,573
and numbers at the end.

242
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,060
And in terms of the password expiry,

243
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,180
so 34% they have a 90
days which is three months

244
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,010
so after three months
the password gets expired

245
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,680
and followed by 60 days or two months

246
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,859
with 16% of the organization
they enforced two months

247
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,420
and 14% of the organization
they have a five weeks

248
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,053
or a bit more than one month
of the password expiry.

249
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,170
And 35% of the organization
they are aligned

250
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,550
with ICM, PCI DSS, 15%
are aligned with CIS,

251
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,130
14% aligned with Microsoft and the rest

252
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,053
they have different password
expiry requirements.

253
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,220
So, our clients, they are
in different organizations

254
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,689
or different sectors.

255
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,920
So we have clients in
government, technology,

256
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,361
insurance, healthcare.

257
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,170
And these are the average values

258
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,002
that we see across our data set.

259
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,500
I'll pass to William to
go through this with you.

260
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,167
- Yeah, so what's
interesting about this is,

261
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,220
like I said, at the
beginning of the slides,

262
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,730
we had some preconceived ideas about

263
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,683
who would be doing it better,
or what we expected to see.

264
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,280
Typically out of experience,

265
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,360
and this is not taking
a swipe at governments,

266
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,670
but government organizations
tend to lack a little bit.

267
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,260
So we figured government
institutions would probably be

268
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,900
at the lower end.

269
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,959
Technology companies are
typically seen as at the forefront

270
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,590
of doing cutting edge stuff.

271
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,370
So, and the user base
is also supposed to be

272
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,380
a bit more tech savvy
than the average user.

273
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,310
So, my expectations was when
we started looking at the data

274
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,030
that government would be at the lower end

275
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,569
and technology companies
would be would be far ahead.

276
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,807
Banking and financial, a
lot of them are covered

277
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,450
by PCI DSS, so they have to align with it,

278
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,200
but I would have expected to
see much stronger policies

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,140
in that scene, in that area.

280
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,630
What we ended up seeing was that on the

281
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,360
on the balance of the whole,

282
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,380
pretty much everybody just
when it came to length,

283
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,910
on average, people just
stuck to the default

284
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,050
so that all the Microsoft recommendations

285
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,410
or the bare minimum that
is prescribed to them.

286
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,317
Which is, again after
talking about password

287
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,620
and password security and
the concept of complex

288
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,000
and long passwords and
passwords versus passphrases,

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,313
this is surprising to see that
at an organizational level,

290
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:05,710
it hasn't really changed and
it's still being done either

291
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,503
by default or the bare minimum

292
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:11,323
that people are required to do.

293
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,821
And all of that stuff is
great and all of these numbers

294
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:19,500
all makes for great
pie charts but if I had

295
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,500
to put my bad guy hats on,
like I said, we do this

296
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,720
for a living, when we see
password policies like this,

297
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,550
I mean a couple of things
spring to mind for us.

298
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,900
I mean, if we see password
policies with eight

299
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,473
to nine character length, minimum length,

300
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,403
we immediately know that,

301
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:44,440
there's going to be some
short easy guessable passwords

302
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,270
that we're gonna find.

303
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,740
And again, we do this with
such regularity that we know

304
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,823
once we get in, we're probably
gonna progress through

305
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:54,744
the rest, we can compromise the rest.

306
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,610
And once an attacker has
actually moved into your network

307
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,320
and getting some form of privilege,

308
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,950
getting access to the rest of
your organizational passwords

309
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,800
are typically easy.

310
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,510
And with short length in
force, it makes cracking

311
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,100
and recovering those
password pretty trivial,

312
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,690
but we'll see that in a couple of slides.

313
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,103
Another thing to considering
is high lockout thresholds.

314
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,740
This aides us if we wanna
perform password spraying

315
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,730
or password brute forcing attacks,

316
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,440
not being locked out greatly
improves the efficiency

317
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,090
of which we can perform those attacks.

318
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,950
On the other side, long lockout timeouts,

319
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,140
has a detrimental effect on companies.

320
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,060
So we can pretty much perform
a denial of service attack

321
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,819
against users by just
locking up their accounts

322
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,870
and having them stay locked
out for an extended period.

323
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,030
Also, one of the components
of the password policies

324
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,610
is the password histories.

325
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,610
So if there's a short history
or not a history enforced,

326
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,180
it creates the ability for users

327
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,060
to start recycling passwords,
alternating between numbers,

328
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,819
letters or just using
one or two base passwords

329
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,020
and just keep on cycling through them.

330
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,410
So overall, it does create,
if your password policy

331
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,000
is not optimal for your organization,

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,204
it does create quite
a few gaps with which,

333
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:17,700
can give attackers the
advantage when trying

334
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,800
to breach the network.

335
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,900
So, password policies typically,

336
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,319
we don't really see a lot of
people talking about them,

337
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,810
because they're pretty
boring and like I said,

338
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,520
I mean, I think people believe

339
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,197
that we understand them
well enough and that it's

340
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,990
a well understood problem.

341
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,780
But, like having the policy
defined is all well and good,

342
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,970
but in the next couple of
slides, we're gonna actually look

343
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,950
at passwords that's conforming
to those password policies

344
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,350
that we've just analyzed.

345
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,260
And the big problem is that
users are typically not educated

346
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,030
and when I say not educated,
I know that we spend

347
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,250
a lot of time with an organization's doing

348
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,730
user awareness training
and putting out flyers

349
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,310
and things like that, but I sort of refer

350
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,149
to this as the mom test.

351
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,820
If I look at my mom's password, after,

352
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,679
she's gone through everything at her work

353
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,650
and educational training,

354
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,550
and I still look at what
she sets her passwords,

355
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,080
and she handles her passwords,
that's kind of indicative

356
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,060
to what the normal non-technical user

357
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,290
on the network would be.

358
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,580
And if my mom is failing at this,

359
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,730
I'm pretty sure a lot
of other people inside

360
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,240
of your organization are still failing,

361
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,470
you know gonna be failing at this.

362
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,413
MFA comes up a lot in conversations,

363
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,743
and we're gonna also touch on
that in a bit and at the end.

364
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,600
MFA is great, but it's not
gonna cover you, for everything.

365
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:46,740
There's a lot of misconfigurations

366
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,690
that can happen around that.

367
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,620
And then the last one is weak passwords.

368
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,620
that they're still being
allowed by the password policies

369
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,283
that are being defined.

370
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,580
- Yeah, so during our engagements one

371
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,050
of the primary goals
or one of our goals is

372
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,409
to compromise the domain controllers

373
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,890
in a Windows environment or
take over the Active Directory.

374
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,680
And when we do that we
dump a file which is empty,

375
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,010
technical way its empty the a file.

376
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,050
Basically it's a database of
the Active Directory containing

377
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,940
all the information about the
username in Active Directory,

378
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,840
including the password hash, the history

379
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,100
and the membership and everything.

380
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,270
So, when we obtain that
during our engagement,

381
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,010
we try to crack the hashes or

382
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,710
to obtain the clear text passwords.

383
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,090
And these data that we analyzed are based

384
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,189
on the actual crack password that we did.

385
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,410
And what we use for to just
give you an idea of this

386
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,110
is not a difficult task or difficult job.

387
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,100
So in terms of the cracking,

388
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,020
so what we use for cracking the hashes

389
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,690
are its normal PC with four
GPUs and normally because

390
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,550
of the time constraint that we
have during our engagements,

391
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,110
we usually spend between two
three, maximum five hours

392
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,550
in cracking the password.

393
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,250
So we don't spend that much
time because we don't have

394
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,170
that long time during
our typical engagements.

395
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,960
So what we see in our data

396
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,660
is that almost half of the
passwords that we crack,

397
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,640
they are following the eight characters.

398
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,990
So they are eight characters
in terms of the password length

399
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,310
and this is in line with what we saw

400
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,360
in the password policies.

401
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,990
So again, this shows us that if you have

402
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,700
a weak password policy, and
if you set the bare minimum

403
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,690
for the users, the minimum for the user,

404
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,570
they just follow the bare
minimum so they don't increase

405
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,490
that bar that much often.

406
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,960
And almost 60% are, as we
will see in the future slides,

407
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,690
in the next few slides, almost
62% or 65% of the passwords,

408
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,973
they are in the eight to nine characters.

409
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,760
And in terms of the password,

410
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,240
as the password is a more
lengthy like in terms

411
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,600
of the length, it is less
crackable, less guessable,

412
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,030
because one of the things that we do

413
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,389
on daily basis in our engagement is we try

414
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,320
to guess the password to get in or to get

415
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,929
the initial foothold in the network.

416
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,896
So if you have a longer passwords,

417
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,010
it's more difficult to crack.

418
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,840
And in terms of the character
sets, 42% of the password

419
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,399
they have a mixed alphanumeric
means lowercase uppercase,

420
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,180
and a number like password
one with capital P,

421
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,130
and followed by lowercase alphanumeric

422
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,473
like password1 for all
characters in lower.

423
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,210
And the question is does size
of the length really matters?

424
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,370
And the answer is yes.

425
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,370
So almost 60% of the passwords that we see

426
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,840
where the users are using,
they fall on the eight

427
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,730
to nine characters of the
length and it's about 73

428
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,180
of the passwords from
seven to nine characters

429
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,750
which covers the bare minimum
of the standards which we see

430
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,160
in PCI DSS, Microsoft and NIST.

431
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,910
So again, this is another proof

432
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,110
that if you have a minimum requirements,

433
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,179
most of the 72% of the users,

434
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,890
they just follow the bare minimum.

435
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,790
So it's very important to have
a strong password policies.

436
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,700
And so if you Google for
things like weak passwords,

437
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,570
common passwords, so
what you can see in all

438
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,429
of those search results,
all the research shows that

439
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,970
you will see welcome one, password one,

440
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,017
or one Welcome12345678.

441
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,709
But what was very interesting in our case,

442
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,140
or in our research was that we see lots

443
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,460
of patterns based on the company name.

444
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,153
So we see things like if
the company name is ABC,

445
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:54,030
for instance, is ABC123
ABC@ the current year which

446
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,960
is 2020 or @2019.

447
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,220
And these are the four top passwords

448
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,500
that we see in our industry.

449
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,047
So it's a very good
indicative for an attacker

450
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:09,240
and as a tester point of view.

451
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,800
So if we want to try or
we want to get a password

452
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,360
during our engagement, so this
is typically what we go for

453
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,570
like we take the company
name, we add the current year,

454
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,550
at sign the current
year, and in most cases,

455
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,889
we will get a hit, or
with things like Welcome1

456
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,840
or Password1, so most of our
engagements we see at least one

457
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,399
of these weak credentials.

458
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,400
And the top 10 base words that
we see are welcome, password,

459
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,360
the current season or the
current week of the day,

460
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,260
so again, this is very useful
for attacker and the tester.

461
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,709
And in terms of the
permutation of the passwords,

462
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,610
so for almost 44% of the
passwords that we see,

463
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,500
the format follows the first
capital and the last number

464
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,880
like Password1 and 21% of the passwords,

465
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,060
they have two digits at the end and 60%

466
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,960
of the passwords they have
a single digits at the end.

467
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,580
And the statistics or the data shows

468
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,012
that the last four digits of the password,

469
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:13,693
they following a trend,
which is, for instance,

470
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:15,110
the current year.

471
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:21,770
- Okay, so now that we've
spent some time on this,

472
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,740
and we've looked at the
numbers and the passwords.

473
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,210
And again, I don't suspect that
a lot of this stuff is new,

474
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,970
I think this ground has
been covered, quite a bit,

475
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,090
but the reality is, we still
see this on a daily basis.

476
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,173
So, what can we do with this?

477
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,040
Some common blind spots that people have

478
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,430
when setting password
policies or deciding on how

479
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,023
to implement password controls,

480
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,280
they tend to focus on
the defaults as provided.

481
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,320
Again, like we've seen
Microsoft probably has

482
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,889
the biggest influence on password policies

483
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,269
in corporate environments, but just

484
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:00,200
because they provide Active
Directory infrastructure.

485
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,190
But common things that
you need to look out for

486
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,460
when managing your passwords
in your organization

487
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,219
is making sure that you don't
allow users to set passwords

488
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:12,060
that's contained in previous breaches,

489
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,730
blacklist dictionary words,

490
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,130
trying to discourage repetitive sequences.

491
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,483
And also the biggest
thing that we can say is,

492
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,300
context-specific words
like your organization,

493
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,210
every company does, and I
know this from experience

494
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,250
that there's a company specific password

495
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,613
in every single organization, right?

496
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,620
That is a very, very bad idea,

497
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,183
because those tend to leak out.

498
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,460
And, based on the
analysis that we've seen,

499
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,074
it's typically very
easy for us to get that.

500
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,350
Like I mentioned before MFA is,

501
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,293
in some of the previous
slides, is a fantastic control,

502
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:50,069
and it's very effective.

503
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,420
The problem is that MFA it
does have some drawbacks.

504
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,657
They are some weaker
implementations of MFA,

505
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,196
but the biggest problem with MFA

506
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:03,760
is it's not consistently
applied across all interfaces.

507
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,810
You typically find it on very selective,

508
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,490
with people in critical
interfaces on the perimeter,

509
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,670
like your office 365 or your mail exchange

510
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,580
or things like that.

511
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,240
But a lot of other authentication
points on the perimeter

512
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,745
that still do tie in with,

513
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,879
is not necessarily covered by the MFA.

514
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,390
A typical example would
be PowerShell for exchange

515
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,463
or legacy entry points
into your mail system.

516
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,233
Where the web UI does enforce MFA,

517
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:35,490
those entry points, typically,
we find that the MFA

518
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,033
is not been enabled on them, right?

519
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,070
So, going forward, this is
just some practical advice.

520
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,300
Now, again, a lot of this
is not earth shattering,

521
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,223
but just please keep that in mind.

522
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:52,540
From a human factor,

523
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,090
ongoing user education and like I said,

524
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,213
I do know that we do spend a lot of time

525
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:01,533
with our corporate training
and things like that,

526
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,870
but maybe users need to be made more aware

527
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,669
of the actual consequences,
of how breaches occur,

528
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,470
how frequently they occur
and what the consequences

529
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,980
to the organization as well as
their own privacy is, right?

530
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,030
Encourage them not to
use corporate credentials

531
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,940
on public websites.

532
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,153
We see this every day.

533
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,820
We look at public breaches,

534
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,389
which are from random gaming
sites or social media sites.

535
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,800
And instead of us looking
for corporate domains,

536
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,379
we just look for corporate names based

537
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,600
on the password patterns that we see

538
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,469
and you can actually identify
private email addresses

539
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,440
using corporately
associated passwords, okay?

540
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,823
So there's a lot of information
that can be gained on that.

541
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,660
Monitor and inform, you
can also aid your users

542
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,617
in actually monitoring their own accounts,

543
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,383
their private accounts,

544
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,639
to have them notified when
they pop up in a breach list.

545
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,580
Password manager is a
great software and it's

546
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,913
a great recommendation.

547
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,050
But encourage users to use
it in their private lives,

548
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,723
not just for the corporate lives.

549
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,650
Strong password policies,
like we said length

550
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,650
over complexity.

551
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,810
The longer the password,
the more difficult it is

552
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,110
to crack but also, using
less complicated passwords

553
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,459
makes it easier to
remember like for humans,

554
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,860
not necessarily machines, right?

555
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,520
And the thing is, if you
get it right, if you have,

556
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,210
long passwords that are well monitored,

557
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,130
you probably don't need to
expire them that often right?

558
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,830
And that takes away the repetitive nature

559
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,879
of people creating passwords that repeat.

560
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,120
Have MFA everywhere, like I
said, people tend to put it,

561
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,399
leave it where it's
necessary, but you really need

562
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,890
to put it everywhere.

563
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,100
Also on eternal I mean,
having it as a step up,

564
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,760
type of authentication method,

565
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,250
when performing sensitive
operations on the inside

566
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,560
is really a must in today's world.

567
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,570
Also practical, no defaults
or weak passwords like I said,

568
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,040
having company specific
passwords is a big no, no,

569
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,530
because they do leak, it's easy to guess.

570
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,330
and we find them literally everywhere.

571
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,179
And lastly, don't forget that
machines have feelings too.

572
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,750
Service accounts, machine
accounts, devices that you plug

573
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,340
into the network, those
typically do get forgotten along

574
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,199
the way, because they're
not people, right?

575
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,400
You can't educate them
and they rely on people

576
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
to set and maintain those passwords.

577
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:34,640
You need to make sure that
whenever you type anything

578
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,920
that's a machine related
account or device unit make sure

579
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,810
that those password policies,
your policies are treated

580
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,513
the same way as normal human does.

581
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,616
Regular identity audits,
make sure that you've got

582
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:50,531
that you don't have any
passwords in your network.

583
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:54,610
Make sure that you weed
out dormant accounts,

584
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,840
monitor for failed
logins, suspicious logins

585
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,199
and even logins from
geographical regions for users

586
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,713
are not supposed to be.

587
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,230
Some of the quickest things
that you can do this week

588
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,710
is just to quickly check your
organization to make sure

589
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,603
that there's no passwords
contained in current breaches.

590
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,630
In the next three months, just
take a look at your policies,

591
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,170
redefine your current password policy,

592
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,070
make sure that it is not just default.

593
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,699
Re look your MFA implementations, right?

594
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,045
Make sure that you've got
strong authentication everywhere

595
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:29,690
where it matters and then
continue to user education

596
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,360
and implement regular
identity audit as sort

597
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,340
of like BAU your business,
every six months do it.

598
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah, that's it for us.

599
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,280
This is me and Hamed,

600
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,500
I hope you guys enjoyed the presentation.

601
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,423
And yeah, thank you.
