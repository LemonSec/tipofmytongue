1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,170
- Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,190
through the eyes of the adversary,

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,059
how to build a threat intel program.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,279
If you're joining us live,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,830

And now like to turn it
over to Scott Jarkoff

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,283
and Jason Rivera for the presentation.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,030
- Awesome, Thank you Casey.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,870
So hello everyone, my name is Jason Rivera

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,553
and I'm the director of the
strategic threat advisory group

14
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:42,510
at CrowdStrike and my
colleague Scott Jarkoff

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,117
actually leads our Asia
Pacific region as well

16
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,989
and as well as the Europe
and Middle East regions,

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,290
most recently as well.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,860
So, I'm gonna be delivering
the presentation today.

19
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,460
Scott will be available via Slido

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,920
to answer any questions that you may have.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,510
So, let's make this nice interactive

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,410
'cause we definitely wanna make sure

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,150
that this is useful for you all.

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,050
On that note, let's go
ahead and get started.

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,360
So here's the agenda of what
we're gonna be reviewing today.

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,850
There'll be five sections

27
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,410
and your notice that we're
gonna kind of start off

28
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,229
at a high level, with kind of
the conceptual type contents

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,800
where we understand conflict,

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,320
and then we're gonna slowly
dive deeper and deeper,

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,479
kind of throughout.

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,503
We'll talk about how to
perceive threat intelligence

33
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,920
through the eyes of the adversary,

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,970
how to, understand threat
intelligence capability areas,

35
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,429
how to serve various
stakeholders and form the team

36
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,360
as well as examples of
how to operationalize

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,363
threat intelligence.

38
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,570
So for this first portion,

39
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,669
let's take a look at how we
can really understand conflict

40
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,710
and explore the reasons

41
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,710
why we're doing this in the first place.

42
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,420
So when it comes really down to it,

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,710
the purpose of threat intelligence

44
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,339
is to understand the conflicts
in which you are engaged.

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
And in general,

46
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,420
you'll find that you are engaged

47
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,940
in three types of conflicts.

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,980
There is security conflicts,
which is more so about safety

49
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,100
and national resources,

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,949
worrying about other
countries invading you

51
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,870
or stealing your secrets,
things like that.

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,860
There is economic conflicts,

53
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,929
which are mainly financially motivated.

54
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,810
So I think if like criminals
trying to steal your money,

55
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,540
you can also think of it in
the form of economic espionage.

56
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,350
And then the last type of conflict we have

57
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,160
would be ideological conflict.

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,780
So from a cyber perspective,

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,550
this would kind of be like the hacktivists

60
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,850
or those that are coming after us

61
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,790
for ideological type reasons.

62
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,410
It could be religious reasons.

63
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,910
It could be reasons over world events.

64
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,820
It could be a variety of different things,

65
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,890
but you'll find that in general,

66
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,649
that these are the
three types of conflicts

67
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,200
that you will find yourself in.

68
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,070
So specifically as it
pertains to conflict,

69
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,250
we really want to understand

70
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,915
the fundamental nature of conflict.

71
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:37,440
We wanna understand how this
divides us into two sides.

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,250
And one way to think of
this is, it divides us into,

73
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,900
ourselves and the adversary

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,560
and the reason that it divides us,

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,540
is when you think about how
we are prior to conflict

76
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,540
before conflict, we're all
together, we're all united,

77
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,410
but then eventually
these differences arise

78
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,930
and again, these differences
could be security related.

79
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,830
It could be economic related,
it could be ideological,

80
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,420
but fundamentally what happens
is that these differences

81
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,359
divide us into two separate sides

82
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,290
and that is the reason why we are engaged

83
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,053
in the conflict in the first place.

84
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,850
So when it comes to threat intelligence,

85
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,739
really what you wanna think about here

86
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,260
is that we want to leverage
threat intelligence

87
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,239
to understand this conflict.

88
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,730
And that is ultimately our goal, right?

89
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,179
The better we understand
the conflicts that we're in

90
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,350
to include the adversary's capabilities,

91
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,549
why they're attacking
us in the first place,

92
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,950
even how they perceive
of our organization.

93
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,803
There's lots of different things

94
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:28,090
that we want to understand
about that conflict.

95
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,550
And our goal of threat intelligence

96
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,330
is that once we gain an
understanding of these conflicts,

97
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,720
and once we truly understand
it at the core level,

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,620
then we can communicate it
to our various stakeholders

99
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,420
and those stakeholders can
take productive actions

100
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,470
in order to defend your organization.

101
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,210
So again, this is kind
of the underlying premise

102
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,890
of what we're gonna be going over today.

103
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,100
And now we're gonna dive deeper

104
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,549
into the various elements
of threat intelligence.

105
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,670
So, per the title of the brief,

106
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,920
what we're really gonna focus on today

107
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,239
is how you really perceive

108
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,540
threat intelligence through
the eyes of the adversary.

109
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,310
And the goal of understanding anything,

110
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,340
whether it be a conflict or an argument

111
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,320
or any type of debate
that we find ourselves in

112
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,329
the ability to see what
the other side sees

113
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,560
the ability to see through
the eyes of the adversary

114
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,070
and to see through the eyes of the enemy.

115
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,829
That's what allows us to really excel

116
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,950
and achieve our objectives

117
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,000
in terms of the ability
to understand conflict.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,937
So first let's imagine that
all conflict between ourselves

119
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,220
and the adversary can be visualized really

120
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,610
as a function of three components,

121
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,390
and when we think about, and
when i say all conflicts,

122
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,210
I mean, literally all conflicts,

123
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,479
not just cyber conflict, but any conflict

124
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,860
and those elements are
mind, body and actions.

125
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,660
And you'll notice that this really applies

126
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,240
to any conflict that you're in.

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
And when I say mind, body and actions,

128
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,580
what I mean by mind is sort of like

129
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,120
the psychological components.

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
So how well prepared are you?

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,650
And then from a body component,

132
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,320
it would be consisting of kind of like

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,330
the actual body elements.

134
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,870
what are my capabilities?

135
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,070
What are my weapons?

136
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,750
And then actions would be like literally

137
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,690
the execution of actions.

138
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,580
So let's take a look at how
some of these examples apply.

139
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,609
So it could be a sports match, right?

140
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,750
and let's look at some of these examples.

141
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,470
So for like a sports match,

142
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,930
the team with the better strategy

143
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,490
would have the mental advantage.

144
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,830
The team who's more physically fit

145
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,280
would have the body advantage.

146
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,299
Whereas the team that
executed the better gain time

147
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,250
execution would be better
in terms of actions.

148
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,950
And then if you look at
like a fist fight right?

149
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,560
Let's say we get into a
physical fight with each other.

150
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,100
From a mental perspective,

151
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,250
if we wanna think about which fighter

152
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,640
is more mentally prepared?

153
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,610
Which fighter is more physically fit?

154
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,590
Which fighter threw the better punches?

155
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,409
And then lastly with war,

156
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,000
again the same principles, right?

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,820
Which army had the better strategy?

158
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,460
Which army was better equipped?

159
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,669
Which army executed
better on the battlefield?

160
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,790
And you'll notice that no
matter what conflict you are in,

161
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,690
you will always see these three elements,

162
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,719
mind, body, and actions.

163
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,080
So now, let's take this principle

164
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,320
and let's apply this
from a cyber perspective

165
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,530
'cause obviously, all this are

166
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,169
cybersecurity professionals,

167
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,330
and we're trying to learn to see

168
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,830
how we can really apply this

169
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,359
in order to engage in threat intelligence,

170
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,700
to protect our information
technology environment.

171
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,490
So once again, lets kind of load up,

172
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,540
the two elements, right?

173
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,190
You have yourself and the adversary,

174
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,960
those are the two underlying elements.

175
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,700
And then we have the
three echelons, right?

176
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,719
You have mind, body and actions,

177
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,220
but instead let's use the verbiage,

178
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,410
strategic, operational, and tactical.

179
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,530
And the reason we're gonna use the

180
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,809
verbiage strategic
operational and tactical

181
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,360
is because this translates better to,

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,100
other security stakeholders.

183
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,080
But again, ultimately the basis of this

184
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,623
is the mind body and action elements.

185
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,080
So when we think about
the strategic component,

186
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,710
what we're concerned about here is,

187
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,650
why is the adversary going to
attack us in the first place?

188
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,190
What is it about our industry?

189
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,930
What is it about our assets

190
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,890
that, makes us an attractive target?

191
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,110
For what reason might they have
the motive to come after us?

192
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,720
Are they security
motives, economic motives,

193
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,070
ideological motives.

194
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,290
And then we wanna explore
things like their intent,

195
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,580
do they want to extort us?

196
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,109
Do they want to steal from us?

197
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,820
Commit espionage against us

198
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,200
or engage in destructive attacks?

199
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,599
And then the level below this,

200
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,730
is we wanna understand
what the adversary is

201
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,920
going to target in our organization

202
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
and probably the best
way to think of your body

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,890
or the operational component is people,

204
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,890
processes and technologies.

205
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,270
All organizations are comprised
of these three things.

206
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,599
And then when we think about
this from the adversary side,

207
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,270
we wanna understand their capabilities

208
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,650
and their infrastructure

209
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,679
in terms of capabilities,

210
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,090
we're concerned about the type of malware

211
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,109
they might leverage

212
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,480
or distributed denial of service attacks,

213
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,930
social engineering, so
we wanna know the malware

214
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,790
they'll leverage against our technologies

215
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,140
or the social engineering they'll leverage

216
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,349
against our people.

217
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,210
And then from an
infrastructure perspective,

218
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,210
we want to know where these capabilities

219
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,060
So from which IP addresses

220
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,343
or from which locations, which domains?

221
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,243
And then lastly,

222
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:42,940
we wanna understand how the
adversary is going to get

223
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,420
into our organization.

224
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,010
We want to understand the tactical level

225
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,170
or the actions that they will
take to gain access to us.

226
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,300
And in general, you can think
of your organization across

227
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,790
three access vectors,

228
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,460
the digital, physical and
psychological access factors,

229
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,150
digital being things like,

230
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,669
exploiting systems or applications,

231
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,270
physical being physical attacks like USBs

232
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,859
and supply chain compromise

233
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,320
and psychological being things like

234
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,420
social engineering, or coursed of attacks

235
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,950
such as bribery and threats
and things like that.

236
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,620
And then of course, we wanna
think about the tactics,

237
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,640
techniques and procedures

238
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,750
or TTPs that they're going to leverage

239
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,770
in order to gain access to us.

240
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,560
So again, ultimately our goal is to

241
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,730
understand what industry am I in?

242
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,993
And what are my business critical assets?

243
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,150
What adversaries are motivated
to target my industry

244
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,423
and how might they do so?

245
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,919
How will the adversary exploit my people,

246
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,622
processes and technologies?

247
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,210
What capabilities will the adversary use

248
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,640
against me and what infrastructure

249
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,340
will these capabilities come from?

250
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,380
And then how will the
adversary gain access

251
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,780
to my organization across
the digital, physical

252
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,610
and psychological access vectors?

253
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,380
As well as what tactics,
techniques and procedures

254
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,630
will the adversary leverage to gain

255
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,930
access to my organization?

256
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,270
So again, the goal of intelligence,

257
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,160
so just want to understand these things,

258
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
the deeper our understanding
of these things

259
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,140
and the better, our ability to articulate

260
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,670
that understanding to other stakeholders,

261
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,199
the better our ability to
perform threat intelligence.

262
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,700
And again, something
I want to emphasize is

263
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,280
if you have any questions,

264
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,194
please come chat with Scott via Slido,

265
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,430
'cause I know that some of this
content can be complicated.

266
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,420
So we definitely wanna make sure that

267
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,620
we answer any questions
that you might have.

268
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,910
So let's dive a little bit deeper

269
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,400
and let's dissect this to
kind of another level, right?

270
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,120
So again, we have the adversary side,

271
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,930
we had the strategic operational
and tactical components,

272
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,390
as well as motive, intent capability,

273
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,199
infrastructure, and TTPs.

274
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
And again, we want to really
focus on these elements

275
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,300
because, these are truly the core elements

276
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,359
of our adversary

277
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,230
and our ability to understand these

278
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,990
will help us really kind
of defend our organization.

279
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,610
So here's some examples of what you have,

280
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,910
of how you might see this kind
of manifest into real life.

281
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,540
From a motive perspective,

282
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,250
we discussed that there are ideological,

283
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,420
economic and security motives

284
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,060
from an intent perspective.

285
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,079
We're looking out for
things like extortion,

286
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,380
destructive attacks,

287
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,570
espionage attacks,

288
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,670
and all sorts of other attacks
that the adversary might want

289
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,709
to leverage against us.

290
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,290
From a capability standpoint,

291
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,520
examples might include, malware DDoS,

292
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,180
social engineering and

293
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,689
obviously the various sub categories,

294
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,840
such as ransomware and data steelers

295
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,763
and Trojans, and other
things to that effect.

296
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,430
From an infrastructure standpoint,

297
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,101
we wanna understand things like,

298
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:23,200
what botnets might they use?

299
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,300
What about their command
and control infrastructure?

300
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,770
How are they gonna send spam?

301
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,470
Or what about their hostile IP addresses

302
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,400
and proxies or malware as a service?

303
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,280
Again, we wanna understand
the infrastructure

304
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,953
because that's where the
capabilities are gonna come from.

305
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,280
And then lastly,

306
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,270
we will also wanna
understand kind of the TTPs,

307
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,319
they might leverage against us,

308
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,430
such as physical device compromise

309
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,349
or a supply chain compromise
phishing, lateral movement,

310
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,413
so on and so forth.

311
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,920
And again, the better your
ability to really specifically

312
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,290
understand these things,

313
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,900
the better your ability to,

314
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,360
again, defend your organization

315
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,670
and be really predictive,

316
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,463
with your threat intelligence program.

317
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,537
This next portion, we're gonna talk about

318
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,853
are threat intelligence capability areas.

319
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,153
So once again,

320
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,090
let's kind of think about this
at the more abstract level

321
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,430
and let's think about
where conflict occurs.

322
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,199
In general, conflict can
occur in one of three spaces.

323
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,010
There's your space, which is you,

324
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,510
there's the adversary space

325
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,000
and then there's
everything else in between

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,950
which will be considered contested space.

327
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,360
And let's look at some various examples

328
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,010
of how this might apply.

329
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,100
But once again, we have
three different examples,

330
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,420
let's use sports, chess, and war.

331
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,969
And in terms of how these apply

332
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,050
from a sports perspective,

333
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,280
you have your goal,

334
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,439
you have a series goal,

335
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,750
and then the field is contested space.

336
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,940
From a chest perspective,
you have your King,

337
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,730
the adversary's King, and
then the chess board itself

338
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,580
and all the pieces would
be the contested space.

339
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,900
And then lastly, from a war perspective,

340
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,100
you have your country, adversaries country

341
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,060
and then again, all the
territory in between

342
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,280
and you'll notice that these
principles are universal,

343
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,300
no matter what type of
conflict you are in,

344
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,550
you will notice that you will
see always these three spaces.

345
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,050
You'll always see these apply.

346
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,140
So once again, let's put our cyber lens on

347
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,510
and really take a look at
how this applies to us.

348
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,650
So, from this perspective,

349
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,970
we have our IT environments, the internet

350
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,310
and the adversaries environments.

351
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,609
And within that, now you have,

352
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,370
within these operational spaces,

353
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,500
you have threat intelligence,

354
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,050
you have associated threat
intelligence capability areas.

355
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,479
And these capability areas include

356
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,713
intelligence enrichment,

357
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,950
threat monitoring, the threat
intelligence reporting.

358
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,783
And now let's talk about

359
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,380
what these different
intelligence disciplines are

360
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,480
and how they can benefit our organization.

361
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,580
So let's take a look at
how we can really conduct

362
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,120
intelligence amongst these three areas.

363
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,330
So from an intelligence
enrichment perspective,

364
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,520
this is about consuming
indicators of attack

365
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
and compromise as well as
signature based defenses as well.

366
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
And our goal here

367
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,310
is to empower or enrich defensive alerting

368
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,250
and blocking systems.

369
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,610
Examples of disciplines
under this particular

370
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,800
form of threat intelligence,

371
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,532
might be IOC ingestion, sensor
tuning, or malware analysis.

372
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,380
From a threat monitoring perspective.

373
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,770
Again, we wanna monitor the internet

374
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,020
and we wanna look for things like

375
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,430
leaked credentials, PII,
brand infringement, malware,

376
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,870
malicious mentions, so on and so forth.

377
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,750
And for this area,

378
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,230
we want to cover the various
aspects of the internet

379
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,720
to include the surface web,

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,943
social media, deep and dark
web and digital footprint.

381
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,290
And then we also wanna
consume intelligence reporting

382
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,040
on adversarial, motive,
intent capabilities,

383
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,860
infrastructure, and TTPs,

384
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,310
'cause the better our ability
to understand these things,

385
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,199
the more we can get inside their mindset.

386
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,990
And again, remember if we can see things

387
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,230
from their point of view

388
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,300
that allows us to truly be predictive

389
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,490
in the way that we,

390
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,540
prevent these attacks.

391
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,910
And for reporting, I always use,

392
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,810
I use a model called the what,
so what, what next model.

393
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,199
And in my experience, as an
intelligence professional,

394
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,050
these three elements are
what make a good report.

395
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,240
The what piece is, what is happening?

396
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
Tell me about the information,

397
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,160
tell me you know what's going on

398
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,530
the so what is the implications,

399
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,819
why should you care about this?

400
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,390
Why is this important to me?

401
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,970
And lastly, the what next

402
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,430
is what do we actually do about this?

403
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,560
How do we take action?

404
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,010
What are the defensive
measures that we need

405
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,057
to put into motion?

406
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,830
So again, these are the three elements

407
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,070
of threat intelligence,

408
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,870
in any good intelligence program.

409
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,680
We'll consider a variety of factors

410
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,229
across these three elements

411
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,890
and then create a program
that is appropriately mixed

412
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,992
well amongst these three different areas.

413
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,380
So next thing I wanna go over

414
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,970
some common best practices and myths.

415
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,530
So again, let's look at these three

416
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,490
threat intelligence areas

417
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,440
and let's look at some best practices.

418
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,580
So for intelligence enrichment,

419
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,950
we wanna engage in high
degrees of automation.

420
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,600
We want to ingest timely content,

421
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,670
the closer we can get to now the better

422
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,229
we want to ingest content
derived from attack telemetry.

423
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,900
For a threat monitoring standpoint,

424
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,730
we wanna have well-crafted keywords

425
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,040
we wanna know where to
look for the right threats.

426
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,230
And we also want to really
have expectation management

427
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,180
and realize that not,

428
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,680
we're not gonna get
everything out of this source.

429
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,760
And then from a threat
reporting standpoint,

430
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,250
we wanna have the bottom line up front,

431
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,430
we want to know exactly why
we need to read this report

432
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,430
and exactly what the so what is.

433
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,130
We want reporting that is actionable

434
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,750
as well as focused on implications.

435
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,320
In terms of some common myths,

436
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,370
here's a lot of what
I see in the industry.

437
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,800
A lot of organizations think
that more indicators are better

438
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,959
when in fact, no, it is not.

439
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,027
If you can ingest so much in it,

440
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:16,320
but if you ingest too much,

441
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,990
it could cause false positives,

442
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,020
it could cause a false sense of security.

443
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,040
So you definitely want to avoid that.

444
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,959
Also there's this notion

445
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
that sometimes all
intelligence can be automated

446
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,800
that everything is about indicators.

447
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,240
And, that's just not true, right?

448
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,710
Intelligence is a very broad discipline.

449
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,140
Yes, some of it can be automated
and we definitely want to

450
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,287
maximize our automation,

451
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,387
but we don't wanna put all
our eggs in one basket,

452
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,489
and we definitely wanna pay
attention to the other elements

453
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,693
of intelligence as well.

454
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,370
From a threat monitoring standpoint,

455
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,020
some common things I hear is,

456
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,550
one is just a very, a
fixation on the dark web.

457
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,979
And I will tell you now,

458
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,890
the dark web does not contain
all the answers in the world.

459
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,780
Yes, it contains a certain
subset of the answers.

460
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,740
But again, the problem is much
broader than the dark web,

461
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,280
so we don't just wanna
fixate only on the dark web.

462
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,930
And also there's this
notion that you're gonna go

463
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,780
on the dark web and find chatter.

464
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,435
And here's what I kind
of have to say to that.

465
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:10,310
Smart actors, aren't going
to quote unquote chatter

466
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,520
on the dark web.

467
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,870
The smart ones are just gonna attack you

468
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,790
and think of it logically,

469
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,310
like why would an actor
announce their intent?

470
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,280
So I that's something I
hear a lot about shatter

471
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,260
and that's honestly, I just
wanna kind of debunk that one.

472
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,140
You're not gonna find too
much chatter on dark web.

473
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,319
And then lastly, with
intelligence reporting,

474
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,210
a lot of organizations,

475
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,900
they think they should only
care about their sector

476
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,260
or their geography.

477
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,630
And my logic back to that is,

478
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,640
does malware care about
your sector or geography?

479
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,410
No, malware doesn't care
what sector you're in,

480
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,319
nor does it care what geography you're in.

481
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,740
And especially from a
criminal adversary standpoint,

482
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,350
they're looking for opportunities

483
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,470
so whatever's happening in
your sector or geography

484
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,620
yes, that's relevant,

485
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,830
but you also wanna expand your horizons,

486
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,960
and you want to realize also

487
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,620
for going to the second point

488
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,250
that not all the answers
are gonna be fed to you

489
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,810
on a silver platter.

490
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,900
It really consuming threat
reporting can be challenging,

491
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,230
you have to engage in critical thinking

492
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,123
and it really can be a tough process.

493
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,213
So now let's look at
some of the stakeholders

494
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:05,619
that we need to serve

495
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,060
and talk about how we should form a team

496
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,510
based off these stakeholders.

497
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,290
So in general, you'll find
that there are three different

498
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,480
types of stakeholders.

499
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,940
There are the strategic
operational and tactical.

500
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,530
And what you'll notice
is that each stakeholder

501
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,470
is of a particular type.

502
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,040
So the strategic ones are like the leaders

503
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,940
and decision makers,

504
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,140
the CSO, the CIO CTO, so on and so forth.

505
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,000
And the operational members
are kind of like you and I,

506
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
members of the SOC, their threat hunters,

507
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,129
vulnerability management people,

508
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,080
incident responders,
basically everybody that works

509
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,000
in a SOC,

510
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,440
whereas your tactical stakeholders

511
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,250
are defensive systems such as
SIEMs, firewall, antivirus,

512
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,118
IDs, IPS, EDR, so on and so forth.

513
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,189
And then you'll notice
that each stakeholder

514
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,670
has particular needs.

515
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,580
So for example,

516
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,080
the strategic stakeholders
are on leveraging intelligence

517
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
to make better decisions.

518
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,950
Whereas the operational stakeholders

519
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,480
are focused on using intelligence

520
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,190
to be better at their job functions.

521
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,770
So the SOC analyst wants
to make better use cases.

522
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,700
The threat hunters

523
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,710
wants to know what to threat hunting for

524
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,470
the vulnerability management professional

525
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,560
wants to know how to prioritize
their vulnerabilities

526
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,159
so on and so forth.

527
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,300
And then with your defensive
systems stakeholders,

528
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,820
or your tactical stakeholders.

529
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,360
They wanna leverage
intelligence to achieve faster,

530
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,110
more efficient and more comprehensive

531
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,020
system alerting and blocking.

532
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,080
And again, you really wanna
focus on your stakeholders,

533
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,110
right, 'cause that is the
purpose of intelligence.

534
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,740
We want to understand the
conflicts that we're in,

535
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,240
if all we can do is understand it,

536
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,100
but we don't have the ability

537
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,750
to communicate the intelligence,

538
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,670
then everything that we do is meaningless.

539
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,820
So we definitely wanna
focus on our stakeholders

540
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,149
and make sure that our activities

541
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,350
and our actions are
serving their interests.

542
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,113
So moving on,

543
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:39,400
you also wanna design a team

544
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,950
that is really designed to
serve these stakeholders

545
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,520
and really go after their interests.

546
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,510
So once again, you have
the strategic operational

547
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,980
and tactical stakeholders,

548
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,250
and I would honestly propose

549
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,270
that you create your team.

550
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,410
to be focused around these stakeholders.

551
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,280
So for instance, having
strategic analysts,

552
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,170
which are good at, good at presenting,

553
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,260
good at simplifying really
technical content for

554
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,120
nontechnical audiences.

555
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,850
And then you have operational analysts

556
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,090
who they understand what
it's like to be in a SOC.

557
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,020
They understand kind of
vulnerability management,

558
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,190
they get incident response,

559
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,250
they understand threat hunting,

560
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,940
they don't have to be
experts in all of it,

561
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,130
but they understand what a
day in the life looks like

562
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,720
and their ability to understand that

563
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,357
allows them to translate the intelligence

564
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:17,670
and the useful content for them.

565
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,140
And then you have tactical analysts

566
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,360
which have a really good understanding of

567
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,699
malware functionality at the binary level,

568
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,400
as well as the ability to granularly

569
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,863
communicate adversary,
TTPs, and capabilities.

570
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,690
And again, here's some of the activities

571
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,130
that you wanna see them engage in.

572
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,320
You want your strategic analyst

573
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,929
that really briefing these stakeholders

574
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,040
and receiving feedback

575
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
and driving the direction of the program.

576
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,240
You want your operational analysts

577
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,620
to make the SOC better,

578
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,179
help respond to incidents,
help manage vulnerabilities,

579
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,380
so on and so forth.

580
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,690
And then you want your tactical analysts

581
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,460
to reverse engineer malware

582
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,300
help with ingestion automation

583
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,090
really make everything
function more smoothly,

584
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,449
as well as empower the
rest of the organization's

585
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,353
understanding of TTPs and malware.

586
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,330
Now let's look at...

587
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,889
Let's take a look at some
of these examples in action

588
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,960
and see how we can actually
operationalize this

589
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,323
in our own environments.

590
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,800
So for this first scenario,

591
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,633
we're gonna take a look at

592
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,480
a financially motivated eCrime actor,

593
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,410
seeking to conduct a ransomware attack.

594
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,280
And then as you can see,

595
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,470
what you have over here

596
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,030
is our little mapping of
ourselves and the adversary

597
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,920
and the different echelons of the conflict

598
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,453
to include strategic
operational and tactical.

599
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,760
So first off, let's take...

600
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,920
What industries does ransomware affect?

601
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,930
That's all of us, right?

602
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,520
Ransomware does not discriminate.

603
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,160
So this would be an all
industry type threat.

604
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,470
And the assets are going after

605
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,540
are financial assets,

606
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,800
from a motive (mumbles) perspective,

607
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,000
financially motivated eCrime actor

608
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,957
from an intent perspective

609
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,807
we are focused on extortion,
which is what ransomware is.

610
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,050
We wanna focus on domain admins,

611
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,970
and the reason we wanna
focus on the domain admins

612
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,680
is 'cause the adversary's going to exploit

613
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,833
your domain admins and
the reason for that,

614
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,460
(mumbles) want to get to
your domain controller,

615
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,430
so they can universally deploy
the ransomware throughout

616
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,263
the environment.

617
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,350
From a capability standpoint,

618
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,939
we wanna focus on banking trojans

619
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,290
'cause typically banking trojans

620
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,000
are the precursors to ransomware.

621
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,180
They leverage the banking trojans

622
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,370
to perform reconnaissance,

623
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,850
to better understand the environment

624
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,360
and then to call down the ransomware,

625
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,709
once they gain access to
the domain controller.

626
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,167
And then of course we wanna understand

627
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,322
the ransomware itself.

628
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,670
And then from an
infrastructure perspective.

629
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,540
We wanna understand the
adversary's hostile IP space,

630
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,763
or VPNs, as well as their proxies.

631
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,399
We wanna understand how they're
gonna engage in phishing

632
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,570
in order to get malware
into our environment.

633
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,409
And then we also want to understand,

634
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,710
how our operating systems
might be vulnerable.

635
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,380
So now let's see how intelligence

636
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,480
can help us better understand this threat.

637
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,890
So I'm gonna go ahead
and load up the slide

638
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,450
and then I'll talk over
each of the various pieces.

639
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,380
So from an intel enrichment standpoint,

640
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,210
you wanna consume indicators
of the most current

641
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,600
banking trojan families
associated with ransomware.

642
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,449
You also wanna consume
YARA and SNORT rules,

643
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,420
in order to block custom
compiled ransomware

644
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,570
'cause a lot of ransomware these days

645
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,480
is custom compiled.

646
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,530
From a threat monitoring standpoint,

647
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,770
you wanna conduct web scraping

648
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,110
against potential credential leaks

649
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,879
that could be used to
achieve remote logins,

650
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,130
as well as monitor for malicious traffic.

651
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,730
From a threat reporting standpoint,

652
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,310
you wanna really engage that reporting

653
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,120
on all these major ransomware operators

654
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,370
and you wanna consume
the threat actor profiles

655
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,500
of those actors that
have the most powerful

656
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,400
and most effective ransomware attacks.

657
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,200
From a tactical stakeholder's perspective,

658
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,033
you would wanna focus on

659
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,790
how we can ingest this stuff into the SIEM

660
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,560
in our antivirus solutions

661
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,250
as well as our EDR solutions.

662
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,863
Remember 'cause that's the
purpose for intel enrichment.

663
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,760
From an operational
stakeholders standpoint,

664
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,560
we wanna give this data to threat hunters

665
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,393
we wanna make sure,

666
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,050
our threat hunters have
the most current YARA rules

667
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,500
and SNORT rules so they can
hunt within the environment.

668
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,380
And then we wanna make sure

669
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,730
that we're giving the vulnerabilities

670
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,670
that are exploited by these actors,

671
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,260
to the vulnerability management team,

672
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,250
and the way we might find out
about these vulnerabilities

673
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,500
is through the reporting.

674
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,840
And then from a strategic
stakeholders standpoint,

675
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,673
what we wanna do here

676
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:08,020
is we wanna help inform the CSO

677
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,325
about how to better inform
his or her organization,

678
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:13,080
better defend their
organization from attacks

679
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,149
by helping them make
better spending decisions

680
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,160
better organizational decisions,

681
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,400
and then we may wanna inform the CTO

682
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,620
about, hey, here's a
risk to our environment.

683
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,860
Based off this risk,

684
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,149
we may want to change the way
the environment is structured.

685
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,273
We may wanna buy these new
technologies so on and so forth.

686
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,150
For our second example,

687
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,640
we're gonna review a nation state actor

688
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,473
with intend to conduct

689
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:41,620
espionage against a
pharmaceutical company.

690
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,830
So in this example, our
industry is healthcare.

691
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,483
Our assets, our intellectual property.

692
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,530
The motive might be

693
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,490
something along the lines

694
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,740
to enhance the national
health care capacity.

695
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,710
From an intent perspective,

696
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,163
we're focused on espionage.

697
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,870
From the people perspective,

698
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,709
we wanna focus on the scientists
that they might exploit.

699
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,740
And then from a process perspective,

700
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,730
we want to look at how are
they conducting classified

701
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,313
or sensitive communications.

702
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,550
We also wanna be on the
lookout for the data servers

703
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,260
'cause the data servers

704
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,230
are where the intellectual
property is stored.

705
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,752
And we also wanna think
about the capabilities

706
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,230
that the adversary is gonna use.

707
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,520
And those capabilities might include

708
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,780
remote access tools

709
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,343
as well as data steelers.

710
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,530
From an infrastructure standpoint,

711
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,889
we wanna be aware of the adversary's

712
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,570
human intelligence infrastructure

713
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,020
'cause oftentimes especially with these

714
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,450
high profile intellectual
property targets,

715
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,100
the adversary might actually use people

716
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,250
to perform the attack.

717
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,100
And we also wanna be
aware of the adversaries

718
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,560
command and control servers

719
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,669
to see where they're
performing the attacks from

720
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,983
and where they try to
exfiltrate the data too.

721
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,160
From a tactical perspective.

722
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,320
Now, we wanna look at how
the adversary's gonna get in.

723
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,153
So when you think about

724
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:03,510
how a lot of these
intellectual property attacks

725
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,480
have been done in the past.

726
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,890
We wanna worry about things
like USB thumb drives

727
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,570
or bribery across the
psychological access factor

728
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,850
and then potentially even lateral movement

729
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,263
from a trusted third party.

730
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,230
So again, a lot of these
things are just examples

731
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,063
to get you thinking,

732
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:21,170
but now you guys are kind
of getting the idea, right?

733
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,410
So let's see how intelligence can help us

734
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,910
better understand this threat.

735
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,092
Oops, sorry, I'm experiencing
a slight lag here.

736
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,463
Let me see if I can get the
previous slide up again.

737
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,439
All right, let's look at how
the different intelligence

738
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,270
capability areas can help solve
the previous scenario too.

739
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,160
So from intelligence
enrichment standpoint,

740
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,070
we wanna consume indicators

741
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,800
of the most current remote access tools

742
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,428
and associated downloaders.

743
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:14,330
We also want to engage in
automated sandbox analysis

744
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,639
of malware associated with
those nations state actors

745
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,740
they might want to steal
our intellectual property.

746
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,230
From a threat monitoring standpoint.

747
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,800
We wanna conduct web scraping

748
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,399
and search of intellectual property leaks

749
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,420
and, or evidence of insider threats.

750
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,120
We also wanna scrape for malicious malware

751
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,810
that could potentially
be used to steal data.

752
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,429
From a threat reporting standpoint.

753
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,810
We wanna consume reporting on actors

754
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,740
that are known to steal
intellectual property

755
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,830
so we can familiarize
ourselves with their TTPs

756
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,129
and prepare against them.

757
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,490
And then obviously we know that

758
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,540
it's very common for China to try to steal

759
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,520
intellectual property.

760
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,220
So we wanna on actors like,

761
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,638
threat actors and nations like China

762
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,689
and other nations and threat actors

763
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,450
that are known to steal
intellectual property.

764
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,830
so we can gain familiarity
with their methodologies.

765
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,080
From a tactical stakeholder perspective.

766
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,919
You wanna use things like the sandbox,

767
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,910
antivirus and EDR

768
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,909
from operational stakeholders perspective.

769
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,120
You obviously, the insider
threat team here is,

770
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,639
are very relevant as well as
vulnerability management team.

771
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,760
And then from a strategic
stakeholder perspective,

772
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,580
we wanna focus on physical security,

773
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,570
things like USB drives and
how do they get in there

774
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,600
in the first place.

775
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,560
As well as some of those
human intelligence operations,

776
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,720
where they may be trying to bribe

777
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,780
or threaten people to get their way.

778
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
And then obviously the CTO as well,

779
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
because he has a large purview

780
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,050
over technology within the environment.

781
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,450
So to summarize,

782
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,320
and again, Scott is also here

783
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
to answer questions in Slido as well.

784
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,300
So I hope you've been asking
some good questions to him,

785
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,470
but if you have any more questions,

786
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,920
feel free to ask them now as well.

787
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,210
But to summarize here,

788
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,580
here's basically what we've talked about.

789
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,189
We've talked about a few things, right?

790
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,880
So we're acknowledging
that we are in conflict,

791
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
there's us and the adversary,

792
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,780
and for whatever reason,

793
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,700
there is just something
that we disagree about,

794
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,180
it could be security related,

795
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,930
it could be economic,
it could be ideological.

796
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,070
There's a variety of reasons

797
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,090
that we find ourselves in conflict.

798
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,480
The first thing we wanna do

799
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
in this conflict, is we
immediately wanna take the view

800
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,880
of the adversary.

801
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,970
We want to understand why
they're going to attack us

802
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,030
in the first place.

803
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,220
What about us, makes
us attractive targets?

804
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,940
What types of capabilities and
infrastructure might they use

805
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,260
against our people,
processes and technologies?

806
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,640
And which sort of tactics,
techniques, and procedures

807
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,153
or TTPs might they use to gain
access to our organization?

808
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,670
Once we think we have an
understanding of the situation,

809
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,140
we wanna start collecting intelligence

810
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,460
across the three
intelligence capability areas

811
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,960
to include intelligence enrichment,

812
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,100
which empowers our own
environment with indicators

813
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,899
and other atomic content.

814
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,920
A threat monitoring,

815
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,200
which helps us better understand
threats from the internet

816
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,360
and the threat reporting,

817
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,209
which helps us understand
the adversaries motive,

818
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,010
intent capability,
infrastructure, and TTPs.

819
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,760
Lastly, we want to serve
intelligence stakeholders.

820
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,730
Remember that every
single thing that we do,

821
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,690
every piece of intelligence we produce,

822
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,360
the purpose of it is to
serve the stakeholders.

823
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,530
We have strategic stakeholders,

824
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,700
which are decision
makers at a higher level

825
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,980
operational stakeholders,

826
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,920
which are basically members of the SOC

827
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,490
and then the tactical stakeholders,

828
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,260
which are defensive systems.

829
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,700
So again, all of this here,

830
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
what I'm showing you.

831
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,020
This is designed to help us

832
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,730
better prepare against adversaries

833
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,840
and ultimately again,

834
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,610
kind of like the title of this
deck and this presentation.

835
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,090
We want to be able to view the
problem through their eyes,

836
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,780
the better our ability to view the problem

837
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,680
through their eyes,

838
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,369
the better our ability to engage
in intelligence operations.

839
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:20,860
So thank you for attending,

840
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,020
and at this time,

841
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,680
myself and Scott will take any questions

842
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,930
that you guys might have.
