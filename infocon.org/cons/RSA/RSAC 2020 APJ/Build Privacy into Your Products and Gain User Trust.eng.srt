it over to Sarah Gerber

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,483
for the presentation.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,410
- Great. Thank you so much
for that introduction.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,479
So as she mentioned,

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm here to talk to you
about building privacy

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,759
into your products and gaining the trust.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,410
Well, I don't have a disclaimer slide,

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,950
I feel the need to at least speak to it.

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,810
These are clearly my
opinions, my observations,

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,853
mostly my learnings and lessons,

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,170
not those of my company,

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,130
or really even those of my team.

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,929
Well, I think that we agree,

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,080
this is really coming from my perspective.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,530
So as the agenda shows,

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,150
what I wanna talk to you
about is some regulations,

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,270
mainly the impetus for a lot of this,

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,429
user trust, how we're defining it here

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,480
so that we can solve,

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,140
reframe the problem or really
how the problem was framed

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,440
to us.

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,870
Our approach,

41
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,950
what worked and what didn't,

42
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,750
and then how you can take this home.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Regulations are often
seen as more of a problem

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,410
than an opportunity.

45
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,500
And so I'm here to talk to you about why

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,110
this is more of a opportunity

47
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,780
and why you can use this as an impetus

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,090
to lots of work that you've
been needing to do anyway.

49
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,229
So in regulations,
everyone has an approach.

50
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,410
For us in the United States,

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,250
is really big when GDPR came out

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,460
safe harbor all the previous versions,

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,220
because it was the first real
big transformative version.

54
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,660
HIPAA is clearly the outlier here.

55
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,070
This is protected health information.

56
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,250
This is a call back to the fact

57
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,620
that I started out in hospitals,

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,150
and it's a specific regulatory
body with additional items.

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,890
But really, the idea is that all of these,

60
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,339
wanna protect the user, the consumer,

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,240
with their data,

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,720
and they wanna give more transparency.

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,760
So really, I think everybody
should kind of look at this

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,380
as more of an opportunity to figure out

65
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,870
how to really answer these,

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,803
but also just do the internal work.

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,300
Regulations usually kind of boil down into

68
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,920
a few specific things.

69
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,070
So some data types,

70
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,250
there's usually data
classification that people use,

71
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,170
sometimes you're using a framework.

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,690
There are a bunch of well known NIST ISO.

73
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,300
You might have created one internally.

74
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,400
I know I've tried and it can be tricky.

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,670
Maybe it's the critical security controls.

76
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,700
So usually what it gets to,

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,299
is the sensitivity of the data.

78
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,070
Is it about minors,

79
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,049
is it about health information,

80
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,050
is it specific to a home
address or is it an IP?

81
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,680
Usually along with the sensitivity,

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,270
there's notification requirements,

83
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,120
usually breach notification requirements.

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,280
Most of us are terrified of
those but know very well,

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,870
and then age restrictions as I mentioned.

86
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,020
Oftentimes, if children are young,

87
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,480
or if you have an educational product,

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,700
you're very familiar with these.

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,072
And these are more highly regulated

90
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,543
with the other types of data.

91
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
For user rights,

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,260
really what a most of these
regulations have gotten to,

93
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,709
it's the idea that users
have rights with their data.

94
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,480
And we didn't normally
think about it that way.

95
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,790
But really, they should
be able to access things,

96
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,840
they should be able to change preferences,

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,060
they should be able to delete things.

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,893
Portability,

99
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,790
not on here, but super important.

100
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,799
If they ask they should be able
to receive all of their data

101
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,700
and the machine readable form of it.

102
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,547
What does that look like?

103
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,620
And then marketing.

104
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,920
Do they want to receive
marketing? Maybe not.

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,309
And more of that goes a
little bit with preferences.

106
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,090
I think it has big implications

107
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,690
for how we've earn our products.

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,067
Now, how we're framing user trust here

109
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,339
is a little bit more like
product transparency,

110
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,582
or really data collection transparency.

111
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,089
So what do users want?

112
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,349
They clearly want the service
you're offering, right?

113
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,890
That's why they're there.

114
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,729
They also wanna understand
what the cost is.

115
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,740
I think for very long time,

116
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,420
people just signed
anything clicked anything.

117
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,494
And then people started to realize that,

118
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:35,840
oh, we should read into these,

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,489
we should understand what those look like.

120
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,030
So now people generally

121
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,840
are aware of the fact that
there's a cost for something.

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,429
Whether it's data that
you're handing over,

123
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,880
whether it's collection of things,

124
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,930
whether it's marketing,

125
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,400
whatever it's looks like.

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,330
So they're a little bit more
skeptical of free services.

127
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,229
Now, we can dig into open source,

128
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,980
but really this is
mainly for paid services

129
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,480
or services they collect data.

130
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,300
So usually they wanna know how
to stop or start the service

131
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,297
and then what's being collected.

132
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,030
And you need to be pretty clear about this

133
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,599
because users while they don't necessarily

134
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,890
maybe understand cookies
and how those things work,

135
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,200
they do understand that it
is a transaction, right?

136
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,140
They're getting a service for something.

137
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,640
And so what does it look like?

138
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,109
Why is it so hard to
communicate about data?

139
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,410
I think usually,

140
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,810
our users don't always
have the best background

141
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,823
or the most technical experience.

142
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:27,979
Now, sometimes they
do, which can be great,

143
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,250
can also be hard because it
opens up other conversations.

144
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,850
But really, when we think back

145
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,200
to most of our products and services,

146
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,640
we were just building them to work

147
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,960
and to do something.

148
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,390
Now we gonna have to go through
into the how and the why

149
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,789
of how we put all this
infrastructure together,

150
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,670
how it actually looks at the data,

151
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,850
does it look at the data is it ephemeral?

152
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,480
So the data collection,

153
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,070
I broke down to a few basics

154
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,820
like cookies and user
agents and authentication

155
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,469
Locations. Where do you keep it?

156
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,920
Databases, you connectors
between databases

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,500
and analytics platforms.

158
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,490
So just hanging out in
an S3 bucket somewhere.

159
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,830
And raw logs.

160
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,200
You need to be very sensitive to things

161
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,060
that could contain more
data than you anticipate.

162
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,552
Raw logs are usually a big source of that.

163
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:11,410
And then data access,
how is it managed, right?

164
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,700
This can be both parts.

165
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,430
This could be a person with
a credit card who sign it,

166
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,650
click through agreement.

167
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,130
But now suddenly you have

168
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,963
a third party application

169
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,750
that you weren't necessarily expecting.

170
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,040
Or it can just be how the
internal systems are managed,

171
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
like through SSL.

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,923
But it's important to
understand what that looks like

173
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:27,623
with the onboarding even the
off boarding and vendors.

174
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,460
So, how do we accomplish user trust?

175
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,349
Really, the idea is articulate.

176
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,810
We all have tasks or Terms of Service.

177
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,220
We have privacy policies,

178
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,350
we have cookie tables,

179
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,150
we've got tons of information

180
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,849
that we're required to put out to users.

181
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,860
Really, it's also our job to make sure

182
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,440
that users understand what we're saying.

183
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,940
We have to take it out of legal leaves,

184
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,360
we have to take it out of here.

185
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,810
We're meeting these regulations,

186
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,860
the company here to for

187
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,700
all of that and make it pre basic

188
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,560
so that anyone can kinda
understand what's happening.

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,210
The reason is, if you give
them a little bit more data

190
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,130
or a little bit more information about it,

191
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,980
they can make a judgment call.

192
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,813
And what you want them to do

193
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,280
is to be able to make the judgment call

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,113
and constantly have value.

195
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,910
They go, Oh, no, I
understand what you want.

196
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,885
I'm happy to give that
to you for the service.

197
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,450
You also wanna verify that it's accurate,

198
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,460
and updated regularly.

199
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,190
This is sometimes hard and i got you.

200
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,360
Articulating what you do can be hard.

201
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,290
I know lots of us do
lots of really good work.

202
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,460
And then when we have
an audit or regulation,

203
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,293
we have to go in and document it.

204
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,190
That can be tricky.

205
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,430
But even more so to
verify that it's accurate.

206
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,300
Sometimes we'll make
statements and we're like,

207
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,760
have we checked into that?

208
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,700
We spend 90 days.

209
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,990
Show me the process for that.

210
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,321
What does that really look like?

211
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:41,990
And so it's important
to just do the homework

212
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,900
and verify right?

213
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,770
Trust but verify

214
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,919
and iterate.

215
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,230
It's important to always
kinda know where you're going.

216
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,280
So typically, people have
policy refreshes once per year,

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,070
maybe a cookie policy refresh,

218
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,310
you kind of look and see
what's still accurate,

219
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,730
but trying to figure out what's next,

220
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,040
and what's coming so you can
plan for it ahead of time.

221
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,610
So then you're not signing yourself up

222
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,670
and your engineers up
for a whole bunch of work

223
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,310
right at the end of the year.

224
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,200
So really it's,

225
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,303
speak plainly,

226
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,940
make sure you're speaking
plainly, truthfully.

227
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,890
I mean, figure out what
your next steps are,

228
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,757
so that you can plan for it ahead of time.

229
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,593
For us framing the problem.

230
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,270
We were given a challenge.

231
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,700
And I think it was a reasonable challenge.

232
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,289
But really, this meant that we needed

233
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,550
to engage with a lot of
stakeholders to figure out

234
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,493
how to do this.

235
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,660
Really, we were given the problem of

236
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,110
what data do we collect?

237
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,010
Where's it stored,?

238
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,960
Where's being sent to?

239
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,570
who has access?

240
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,750
And really, why are we collecting
that specific data point?

241
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,100
A very wise counselor that I
work with and the legal team,

242
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,560
he talked about,

243
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,310
data like collection is really
an analogy for pollution,

244
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,829
right? We made great steps

245
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,190
in the industrial revolution
here in the United States,

246
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,380
and several other countries as well.

247
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,050
But as we did that, we
created all sorts of

248
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,839
back-end problems for ourselves, right?

249
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,230
We are polluting into the river

250
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,220
that we're drinking out and
we're ruining sewage section.

251
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,130
So it's like, as you
made lots of progress,

252
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,937
we then have lots of
cleanup that we had to do.

253
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:10,000
And I think data collection could be

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,890
thought of in the same way, right?

255
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,630
Initially, a couple years ago,

256
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,810
10 years ago,

257
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,319
really it was collect everything.

258
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,020
We'll find a use for it later,

259
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,540
then all you're worried
about is managing it,

260
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,660
to make sure we have access,

261
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,492
we know what we're doing,

262
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,440
we didn't really even worry
about retention policies.

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
Now, we have to.

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,579
Data is, quite frankly,

265
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,970
a liability.

266
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,570
You have to understand how it's managed,

267
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,750
who's got access to it,

268
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,750
why we even need it, and
how long we need it for.

269
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,880
And so while these questions
seem pretty simple,

270
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,010
I think for most of us,

271
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,770
it's sometimes hard to
answer them specifically,

272
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,069
especially when you're young company

273
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,730
and so you haven't

274
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,770
rolled out our back-end specific ways

275
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,840
or maybe you don't do
audits in the same ways.

276
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,220
And so, how do we form it?

277
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,170
This and so I think that was...

278
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,319
Its really the challenge
that we were given

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,923
but we saw it as an opportunity.

280
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,180
Our approach to this.

281
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,689
Don't do it alone,

282
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,500
really, and don't do it in a vacuum.

283
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,610
Because the whole goal of this,

284
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,792
is not for you to
understand every product.

285
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,900
And it's a good outcome
for you to understand,

286
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,250
especially if you're like me
and you're on the security team

287
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,470
means it makes your job easier

288
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,030
so you have an incident,

289
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,089
or you need to evaluate
specific third parties

290
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,870
or architectural design issues.

291
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,580
But really, you need buy-in,

292
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,670
and it should hopefully be tucked down.

293
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,400
Your leadership should hopefully
help frame this for you

294
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,370
in those kinds of questions
that are very leading,

295
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,850
like where is our data
and who has access to it?

296
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,550
Because then everybody

297
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,318
has an agenda for it.

298
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,300
And when you're in a meeting,
and you talk about data,

299
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,630
people bring it up.

300
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,463
Well you can bring it up,

301
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,810
but at least it's familiar to them.

302
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,803
This is not a new idea.

303
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,790
And the teams that you
should probably get help from

304
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,949
or legal policy, product engineering.

305
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,010
If you're not doing this
for a product necessarily,

306
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,380
you can do this for other teams

307
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,540
like HR and finance certainly have

308
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,089
very sensitive information.

309
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,890
So you can also do it in that way.

310
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,720
But Want to make sure that
you get a lot of buy-in

311
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,773
from these teams,

312
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:07,260
that you create a whole
other team so that you can

313
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,520
do it better.

314
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,433
This is why we created a trust team.

315
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,190
So the idea behind trust team is that,

316
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,920
trust is the kind of partnership
between legal and policy

317
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,490
and security.

318
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,050
How we keep trust, right?

319
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,990
And because user trust is
really the end of the day,

320
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,350
what we're after.

321
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,460
So it's a shared responsibility.

322
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,870
Everyone on the team is held
accountable for his success.

323
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,470
So from the data validators, right,

324
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,140
maybe the engineers who are populating

325
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,233
your authentication system data points,

326
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,833
documenting what your data
flow diagrams look like,

327
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,699
what the access table should be,

328
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,410
who the vendors are,

329
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,870
and then should you choose
to take it to a formal level,

330
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,300
you can also do certifying.

331
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,050
So you wanna make sure
that you certify things

332
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,410
there are people's names on this,

333
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,242
people understand

334
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:49,653
with more visibility.

335
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,220
Branding. (laughs)

336
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,870
because I work in Silicon Valley,

337
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,700
it's fun to always have a new team.

338
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,980
It means more swag,

339
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,680
means shirts, it means
a specific functions

340
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,780
where you now are not
just part of security

341
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,280
in your own little security bubble,

342
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,689
you're part of the trust team, right?

343
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,150
It means you have friends, lots of sides.

344
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,810
And you automatically walk into meetings

345
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,642
with people going,

346
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:12,753
yeah, you're the trustee,
we should work with you.

347
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,240
One other piece of this that
I think is very important

348
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,280
is shared, planning and alignment.

349
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,630
So everybody needs to make sure

350
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,780
that we have the same
priorities in order, right?

351
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,747
So when you are working with
a lot of different teams,

352
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,923
you wanna make sure

353
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,750
that you're very clear about timelines,

354
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,583
you don't want to say,

355
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,760
hey, H1 will do this,

356
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,330
H2 will do that.

357
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,820
And you also have to be honest

358
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,010
about competing priorities
and projects, right?

359
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,180
So security,

360
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,530
we do penetration tests,
we do assessments,

361
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,600
we do companies reviews.

362
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,930
We have lots of stuff that we
just have built in for cycle.

363
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,912
Legals got policy refreshes
and lots of things

364
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:47,270
that they work on.

365
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,890
So you need to make sure
that you align the timing

366
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,930
so that you can really work
on this cohesively together.

367
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,280
It's good to have shared goals,

368
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,380
that have visibility such as OKRs,

369
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,710
which is what we do or
Objective Key Results,

370
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,780
and it means that all people

371
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,280
are kinda like on the hook
to find a result, right?

372
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,617
So it's really the best method.

373
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,800
Now, how we started to break down

374
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,229
all of these kinda built concepts

375
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,660
was we grabbed a Google Sheet,

376
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,420
you can use Excel sheet,
you can use anything,

377
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,089
very analog, I know.

378
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,530
But the idea was,

379
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,189
let's grab pieces of data that
we know are in the product

380
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,240
and let's start to kind of quantify them.

381
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,540
How much is there?

382
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,372
Where is it?

383
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,560
What are we using it for?

384
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,150
How long is it supposed to be there?

385
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,520
So this is just a quick
example, like a user agent,

386
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,340
not necessarily identifying,

387
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,560
especially if you're just
looking at OS or browser,

388
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,030
you can use this for debugging,

389
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,060
it can actually be very
important and I guarantee

390
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,030
your teams are gonna wanna keep that.

391
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,550
But then who has access to this?

392
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,760
What does it look like?

393
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,173
What systems does it go through?

394
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,420
Does it go directly from the product

395
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,500
to a back-end storage?

396
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,510
Does it to go to analytics tables?

397
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,020
Where does it go?

398
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,340
So it's really important to just kind of

399
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,230
pick some classifications

400
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,640
and start to go down through the process.

401
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,060
So here's an example of kind of our sheet.

402
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,300
And I'll be very clear,
this is not super technical.

403
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,819
The idea behind this, is it
should be readable to anyone.

404
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,470
And so you kind of pick
an area of the product,

405
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,430
something that's easy,
can start easy, right?

406
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,989
So sign-in page.

407
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,820
The data point that we're
talking about here is email.

408
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,920
So maybe we use email,

409
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,377
so the username or as the username.

410
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,319
The user provides us, so
that's how it's collected,

411
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,500
and storage and retention,

412
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,010
so we have it in our authorization system,

413
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,080
and authentication system.

414
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,460
So maybe we do a third party.

415
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,240
We're like, no, we're not
rolling your own crypto,

416
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,080
we don't particularly like open source,

417
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
we're gonna have the third party.

418
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,033
Absolutely. Okay.

419
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,390
They can manage it for
us. It's what they do.

420
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,260
How long do you keep this data point?

421
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,880
Well, considering it's a sign-in,

422
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,910
you wanna keep it for the
length of the account.

423
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,569
So that can feel uncomfortably long,

424
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,300
but when you look at it practically,

425
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,359
you need this just into the product.

426
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,780
So however long you have the account,

427
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,650
is how long you need this.

428
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,300
And then the data classification.

429
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
I love this pretty intentionally vague,

430
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,349
but inherently identifiable, right?

431
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,310
And email usually,

432
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,160
I think we've kind of gone
past the days of like,

433
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,670
Rainbow unicorn 536

434
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,540
into more things that are identifiable,

435
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,099
first name, dot last name,

436
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,070
first initial last name,
things that make more sense.

437
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,260
And so it really is identifiable.

438
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,520
Now you can add to this,

439
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,970
this is a very simple table

440
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,140
and you can really expand I think,

441
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,810
we also did a policy exercise

442
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,920
where we talked about

443
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,560
where in our terms of
service or privacy policy,

444
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,392
these things showed up

445
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,030
so that we can also make sure that we were

446
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,770
verifying as we went along,

447
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,949
and it was articulated properly.

448
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,440
You can add regulation pieces into this.

449
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,150
You can pull in more retention.

450
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,280
So if it's in an authentication system,

451
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,457
but you've got backups stored somewhere,

452
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:43,290
so you're looking at
your disaster recovery,

453
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,910
your BCP, your Business
Continuity Planning.

454
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,410
If you have these in other places,

455
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,660
this is a really good
place to articulate it.

456
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,220
So this is an extremely
simple data flow diagram.

457
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,930
But just to give you an idea,

458
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,010
this is really helpful for framing

459
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,650
all of those data points in your table,

460
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,390
because you wanna
understand how it's flowing

461
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,240
through your system.

462
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
Now for me, this was great

463
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,380
because it helped me understand

464
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,910
how things were flowing through a system

465
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,423
that was pretty legacy.

466
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,069
And where things were, right?

467
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,323
So I wanna know where crown jewels are,

468
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,410
I wanna know where passwords are stored,

469
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,810
I wanna know where like,

470
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,209
whatever it is that your crown
jewels is full text articles.

471
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,860
And so for me, this meant

472
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,640
in the middle of an incident response,

473
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,460
I'm not trying to call it people who know,

474
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm looking at the
documentation that we created.

475
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,220
I understand,

476
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,460
as we wanna make changes to the product,

477
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,640
we can see exactly how it's gonna flow.

478
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,850
What it's gonna do, is it gonna use

479
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,430
the same connectors another

480
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,260
is in this example, like, is
it going through an S3 bucket

481
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,480
or a cluster or database?

482
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,360
This could just as easily be Google

483
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,220
and GC key sequence going
to change that around.

484
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,820
But really, the idea is that,

485
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,030
you understand how data is
flowing through your system.

486
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,589
Where it stays.

487
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,260
Another important point,

488
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,470
a femoral, so like caching.

489
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,640
I would still count that.

490
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,020
I think it's Important to count that

491
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,819
because when I think
about it from an IR lens,

492
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,640
I think about where is the data.

493
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,410
And if there's identifiable data,

494
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,130
even though it's cached and
only there for like 24 hours,

495
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,540
still a point that I
would worry about, right?

496
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,980
It's still something
that I would worry about

497
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,113
if somebody had access
to if they shouldn't.

498
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,470
Feel free also to ask
questions on that part.

499
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,060
I have a lot of information.

500
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,349
And so I'm happy to dig into more of it,

501
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,260
or talk to you a little
bit more about the examples

502
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,860
that we used.

503
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,419
So getting into the
lessons and the learnings,

504
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,900
this is really like what's
hard and what works, right?

505
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,200
Anytime you have a beta
or a pilot project,

506
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,190
it can be tricky.

507
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,826
And so I'm happy to talk to
you about what worked for us.

508
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,630
Time. (laughs)

509
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,390
This took a lot of time, right?

510
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,700
So as you think back to all the

511
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,630
stakeholder management pieces,

512
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,080
you gotta get on the same page,

513
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,070
you have the buy-in,

514
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,360
wanna make sure you've
got shared goals and OKRs.

515
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,750
Really, there was a data migration

516
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,650
that took place during this

517
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,780
so you know somewhere we're
renaming some databases,

518
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,558
same data points. Lucky.

519
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:02,750
But you really have to pay attention,

520
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,810
you have to keep it up to date.

521
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,820
The longer it takes,

522
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,362
the more you have to update and iterate.

523
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:09,430
That's true, right?

524
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,890
Sometimes employees come and go,

525
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,030
sometimes they create their own startups,

526
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,580
there's all sorts of
things that they can do.

527
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,419
So then you sometimes lose these,

528
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,183
like knowledge keepers
of how systems work.

529
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,430
Scope also think different
from stakeholders.

530
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,710
I think, because I sit
on the security side,

531
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,300
mainly with engineers,

532
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,950
we're kind of a little bit more relaxed,

533
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,770
we realize this is not
a box checking exercise.

534
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,197
This is an exercise to
really dig into our data.

535
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,760
But we're also not making
it super formal, right?

536
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
Our thought behind it is
like, we should know all this.

537
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Let's make sure we know
it at each level, right?

538
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,530
Let's maybe have validators
who are engineers

539
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,379
who actually use the product.

540
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,620
And then maybe we'll have the
insurance managers who know.

541
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,760
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

542
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,310
Oh, I sat over there,

543
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,173
'cause they know their team really well.

544
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,050
I think maybe the directors above them.

545
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,230
Well, the directors are
gonna know less, right?

546
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,820
Because they're not typically
hands-on in the systems,

547
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,240
so maybe they'll only notice outliers.

548
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,320
So if you show them kinda
data classification table

549
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,100
with the company evidence
and retention policies,

550
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,933
they might be like,

551
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,500
that's weird, why do
we keep that too long?

552
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,670
Kind like, walk through
and talk through it.

553
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,770
Same with a data flow diagram.

554
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,150
But you have to realize the
more people you want on this,

555
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,730
the more friendly you have to
make it in terms of usability,

556
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,360
so it becomes less technical, right?

557
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,860
And then also,

558
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,110
you need to understand the
formality that you're going into.

559
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,860
So legal, wanted to be a
little bit more formal,

560
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
which makes sense.

561
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,280
They read legal documents,
very formal documents

562
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,210
all the time.

563
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,570
We were like, you know,

564
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,000
we just want people to agree.

565
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,890
So you have to find a good balance.

566
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,870
And you have to make
sure that you compromise

567
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,739
and support everybody's motivation,

568
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,410
'cause everybody's on this team,

569
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,980
believes in this project for a reason,

570
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,320
and usually something that
they're gonna take out of it.

571
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,889
I keep mentioning IR, Instant Responses.

572
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,490
I think some of that goes
through all of our minds

573
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,770
as security professionals.

574
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,540
So everything kind of boils down to you

575
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,500
in the middle of the night.
Do I have the tools I need?

576
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Like was walking in March
It all does alerting,

577
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,510
but also just like,

578
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,860
can I pull out and
understand what's happening.

579
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,130
Also, everybody's got a
different interpretation

580
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,310
of what personal data is,

581
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,040
or consumer information or user data.

582
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,340
Oftentimes, it's the first
thing that they googled.

583
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,330
And so it might not be accurate,

584
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,360
or might come from a previous job

585
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,620
or previous experience
previous industry, right?

586
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,659
I came from hospitals,

587
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,300
I think about protected
health information.

588
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,810
So it's important to
also when you start this,

589
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,250
have a data classification
that you're working from

590
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,880
with really good examples

591
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,340
so that you can talk through it

592
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,260
and let people ask questions.

593
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,610
That way they really understand

594
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,139
and they're gonna develop
this kind of internal antenna

595
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,330
for what the levels are
they go looking for.

596
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,793
It also means that they'll
correct things that are wrong.

597
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,342
The glory of this,

598
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,120
is quite frankly, clean up.

599
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,860
I think everybody agrees
that legacy systems

600
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,699
need to be cleaned up.

601
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,660
You need to sunset things naturally.

602
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,560
You need to get rid of lots of
stuff as you iterate, right?

603
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,080
Spun up a server, great.

604
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,367
We'll deliver it awesome.

605
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,430
But if it's internet facing like,

606
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,450
what if you like the Porto,

607
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,970
but you need to clean up as you go.

608
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,650
And so I think while everybody agrees,

609
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,970
this is really important,
same with like the data

610
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,680
that we're talking about now,

611
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,290
sometimes it's hard to
carve out time to do it.

612
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,520
And so the nice part about
this is people naturally

613
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,720
just started cleaning up stuff,

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,350
mainly because they didn't
wanna waste time documenting it,

615
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,760
they didn't wanna waste time
drawing a data flow diagram,

616
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,930
they won't have to speak to all the pieces

617
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,900
especially if it wasn't in use
and haven't been for years.

618
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,520
So I was super excited to see
messages fly back and forth.

619
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,700
Like, can't we just get rid of this?

620
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,330
We don't, there's no reason for it.

621
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,050
There's no reason for it
over here in our database

622
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,260
where we store everything,

623
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,240
like let's just get rid
of all traces of it.

624
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
So that was really awesome to see

625
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,783
is the fact that this
also spurred other work.

626
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,540
And different teams, I
suppose teams or products

627
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,389
are very siloed.

628
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,720
So maybe the front and the
back-end are pretty siloed

629
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,900
or maybe there's like some
research that you left out

630
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,750
that required everybody to get into a room

631
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,930
and talk directly.

632
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,790
So maybe they're using a
specific third party vendor

633
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,603
for like some logging or maybe,

634
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,560
for logging.

635
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,230
And one team is not using
anything identifiable

636
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,830
but another team is.

637
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,159
If you only talk to that first team,

638
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,850
you wouldn't actually know

639
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,770
the depth of the data that's collected

640
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,603
or where it is.

641
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,870
So it's really important
that you talk to all these

642
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,139
kind of data validators
and these knowledge keepers

643
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,440
of the systems,

644
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
to understand how they're really used

645
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,533
in each part of the
application architecture.

646
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,810
Documentation.

647
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,490
This is great for onboarding,
this is great for incidents,

648
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,610
this is just good in general.

649
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,959
Now you have really good documentation,

650
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,060
you can onboard your
engineers much easier.

651
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,649
You can find ways that you
can fix things much easier.

652
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,790
You can find redundancy
in your architecture

653
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,080
that you maybe didn't intend for.

654
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,669
So it's been honestly like I would say,

655
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,213
the learnings that came out of this,

656
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,960
were so worth the time and the effort,

657
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,970
because everybody walked out of it,

658
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,450
really knowing everything,

659
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,599
really understanding how
the architecture worked

660
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,822
and you know there was some truth,

661
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:02,880
and you bring people up to date,

662
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,150
people had a real understanding
of what was happening.

663
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,980
And we're doing a lot of cleanup,

664
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,420
and making sure that things were

665
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,160
exactly the way they needed to.

666
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,210
And coming out of it
asking questions that,

667
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,800
hey, we wanna add this third party vendor.

668
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,300
We wanna collect this data,

669
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,139
and we think we need it for this long,

670
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,157
questions they wouldn't have
normally thought to ask.

671
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,963
And so that was really wonderful.

672
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,950
So this is the section
about how you can apply it.

673
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,190
So if we were to phrase
this as they have before,

674
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,950
like next week, three months, six months,

675
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,780
really you shouldn't ask questions.

676
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,790
This has to be important within your work,

677
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,240
or at least within a group of people

678
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,620
who can help spurt it, right?

679
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,162
So that kind of talk out
piece we talked about.

680
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,929
You wanna make sure that it's
something that's valuable,

681
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,750
I would probably pick
a really sensitive area

682
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,570
or maybe one that's not for a pilot,

683
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,260
like depending on your ease, right?

684
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,930
Figure out what works for you.

685
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,090
Make lots of friends.

686
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,590
As security professionals,

687
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,300
we should hopefully be very good friends

688
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,899
with legal engineering product and policy.

689
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,280
But if you're not, go make them.

690
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,600
Go talk to them.

691
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Make sure that people understand

692
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,810
what it is that you're trying to achieve,

693
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,933
what this looks like and what the task is.

694
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,990
Apply it.

695
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,080
So you know, within the
first three months, right,

696
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,090
it might take you a
while to get some steam,

697
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,100
might have to put this on
a specific goal or OKR.

698
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,570
Yeah, let's apply it.

699
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,280
But grab a pilot,

700
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,870
grab in Excel or Google Sheet,

701
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,199
or just a piece of paper

702
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,540
and just start documenting, right?

703
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,550
Log onto the product or the system.

704
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,280
Figure out what pieces are there.

705
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,160
There are developers who have
cookies you're collecting.

706
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,980
And then start identifying
this product side

707
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,670
or engineering side people who can

708
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,770
both validate your initial
findings and then add.

709
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,440
'Cause really, once again,

710
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,490
you're not doing this in a vacuum.

711
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,050
This is not an exercise for
you to understand the product.

712
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,139
This is an exercise for everyone

713
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,010
to understand what cohesively
we do for data collection,

714
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,840
where it is and what kind of methodology

715
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,730
for each thing, right?

716
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,410
Sometimes they're not in alignment

717
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,590
with what we think we are,

718
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,207
And so its really important to do that.

719
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,070
It's really important
for the products I don't

720
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,570
fill out their side

721
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,260
and then on the engineering
side to fill out

722
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,407
their side so that we can
then look at it all together

723
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:05,023
and if it's accurate data.

724
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,920
And then also identify
third party vendors,

725
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,063
we have lots of them.

726
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,130
also the links, tools,

727
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,570
especially in security,

728
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,419
'cause they're helpful, they're great.

729
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,620
They can be tricky, but
they're really good.

730
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,610
And then the first six months,

731
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,169
maybe continue to identify
those third party vendors

732
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,450
that contain user information.

733
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,940
And then look at the sensitivity, right?

734
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,320
You've got that data
classification we're looking at.

735
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,730
And partner with the engineering teams

736
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,470
to draw those data flow diagrams.

737
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,960
Begin to document how access
to each system works, right?

738
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,210
Is it MFA, SSL, SSH, or people just

739
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,610
going in through Bastion host?

740
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,939
It's good to understand,

741
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,870
and maybe that's perfectly fine.

742
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,159
But it's important to
understand what it looks like

743
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,860
so that when you have it all in one chart,

744
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,199
it can quantify,

745
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
here's some outliers, right?

746
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,360
Why are we accessing subsystems this way?

747
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,840
Why is it not centrally managed?

748
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,163
What can we do about this?

749
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,040
And then begin to talk about what roles

750
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,090
and people have access along with that.

751
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,560
Sometimes the thought about separately,

752
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,100
I think it's important to also

753
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,810
notice the outliers of roles.

754
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,020
If you have a specific
like maybe PMS or a role.

755
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,653
But you really only have
one person who does it,

756
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,560
then I would probably
just mean that one person

757
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,678
rather than all PMS have access to it,

758
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,640
because they're seeing an outlier.

759
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,380
Then within this,

760
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,470
what you're doing is you're basically

761
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,150
being able to answer those
questions we talked about

762
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,000
in the beginning,

763
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,950
where is our data?

764
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,590
We can now list these systems?

765
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,169
We know how its collected,
whether it's a user,

766
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,390
or a cookie, or how it's being generated.

767
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,960
We know the retention for it,

768
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,580
how long are we keeping it?

769
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,413
We know who has access to it,

770
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,630
you know what systems it lives in.

771
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,160
This is how you begin to really
understand all of your data,

772
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,400
all of your systems
and what it looks like.

773
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,430
And this is a great
opportunity to really dig in

774
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,580
and understand,

775
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,413
it will take time,

776
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:51,210
and it will have painful conversations.

777
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,693
Like I think everything that
you do that's worth doing,

778
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,730
it's not always an easy job.

779
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,600
But hopefully you find a place

780
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,510
and your company and your products,

781
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,240
and your teams

782
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,930
to really dig down in this information.

783
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,600
Please feel free to submit
questions if you have questions.

784
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,899
I had a wonderful time
talking to you about this.

785
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
You can tell it's a
passion project of mine.

786
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,200
I really appreciate it, the transparency,

787
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,520
user transparency,

788
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,220
I think we should have really good

789
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,070
communication and also
relationships with our users

790
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,410
'cause we want them to stay around

791
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,920
and that means we need to
treat them with respect.

792
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,480
Does mean that sometimes
hard conversations

793
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,710
have to be have internally,

794
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,140
but I think it's worth the work.

795
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,173
You can find me on LinkedIn on Twitter.

796
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,070
Thank you so much for attending.

797
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,169
I appreciate the time.
