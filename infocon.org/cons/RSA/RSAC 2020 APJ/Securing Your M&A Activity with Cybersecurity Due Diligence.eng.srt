10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,723
to Murray Goldschmidt
for the presentation.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,280
- Hello and welcome

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,670
from Murray Goldschmidt,

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,380
executive director of cyber
capability at CyberCX.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,160
The region's largest specialists,

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,440
cyber security services provider

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
in the APEC region.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,913
It gives me great pleasure

18
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,230
to speak with you today

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,919
about securing your merger

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,720
and acquisition activity

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,493
with cyber security due diligence.

22
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,080
In this session today,

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,089
we're gonna talk both

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,960
about activities that you should

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880
be doing on the buy side,

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,743
as well as the sell side,

27
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:08,920
when you're evaluating organizations

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,840
that the buyers are looking to acquire.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,390
And we'll wrap it up

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,420
at the end

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,300
with some key takeaways

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,240
and action items

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,850
that you should be able to achieve

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,910
in the next short, medium

35
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,283
and long-term going forward.

36
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,380
What about mergers and acquisitions

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,229
in the marketplace?

38
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,530
There is a high range

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,600
of a variety

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,119
of merger and acquisition deals.

41
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,980
There are big deals,

42
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,050
there are small deals,

43
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,950
and there are some very prominent deals.

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,900
Generally, when you're dealing

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,940
with quite sensitive deals,

46
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,789
the profile of both the supplier

47
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,580
and the buyer

48
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,170
are raised in the market.

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,200
Which may make them more prone to attack.

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,010
It's not virtue of being in the news.

51
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,950
Attackers may also be opportunistic,

52
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,700
looking to take down a toll puppy,

53
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,590
just for the notoriety

54
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,910
and to make a political

55
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,350
or economic statement.

56
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,860
Indeed, very high profile deals,

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,040
including those operating

58
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,370
in sensitive supply chains

59
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,440
for agriculture, resources,
defense contracts,

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,470
and large scale consumer businesses

61
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,459
may draw the attention

62
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,280
of even nation states.

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,690
For this reason,

64
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,920
buyers and sellers

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,750
need to be specifically prepared

66
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,320
for potential attacks

67
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,870
and improve their resilience

68
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,500
during the critical periods

69
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,963
of M&A activity.

70
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,930
The deal room or virtual data room

71
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,290
is where most of the assessment

72
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,280
of a seller or buyer occurs.

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,550
The security of the deal room activities

74
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,610
is therefore paramount.

75
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,900
There are various technologies

76
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,200
and service providers,

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,899
offering a huge variation

78
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,760
in the capability

79
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,739
and security in the marketplace.

80
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,790
The devil here is really in the detail.

81
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,820
In this session,

82
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,709
we'll explore some critical areas

83
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,260
around jurisdiction, data storage,

84
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,870
data retention, access controls,

85
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,576
and also application security

86
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:02,023
of the deal room itself.

87
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,769
Let's first look at
deal room jurisdiction.

88
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,870
The jurisdiction of the data room

89
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,570
can be very important.

90
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,400
When dealing with cloud services,

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,930
the actual location of the data

92
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,710
may be hard to pin down

93
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,940
and you may need to get

94
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,670
into really specific details

95
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,730
and possibly compliance assessments

96
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,880
to validate what a service provider

97
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
is actually offering in the space.

98
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,890
Jurisdiction can be very important

99
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,309
for certain types of deals.

100
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,887
For example, cross border deals,

101
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,400
where the seller

102
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
may have obligations

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,460
to keep data within a specific country

104
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,490
based on the regulations
which they operate.

105
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,250
For example, where I
come from in Australia,

106
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,220
deals with government scrutiny

107
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,520
and oversight may have
specific requirements,

108
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,620
not only for the data location,

109
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,160
but also in restricting access

110
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
to that data from within

111
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,863
a specific country only.

112
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,590
Data governance of the deal room

113
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,350
is also very important.

114
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,780
What data you are asking for as a buyer

115
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,870
and what information

116
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,740
the seller is providing

117
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,560
is really important.

118
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Sometimes, to protect
anonymity or privacy,

119
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,420
sellers may obfuscate certain information

120
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,440
such as client names, staff names,

121
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,350
and other important information

122
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,130
so that if the deal doesn't proceed,

123
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,230
they haven't lost a lot
of sensitive information.

124
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,040
However, at some point

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,570
the information that was de-identified

126
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,300
will need to be re-identified,

127
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,170
and this can be a point
of considerable risk

128
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,270
for both the buyer and the seller,

129
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,460
because at this point

130
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,270
the data becomes really valuable

131
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,450
to both parties.

132
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,370
And of course,

133
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,960
also becomes very valuable to attackers.

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,810
It is imperative to know therefore,

135
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,920
who has access to the data

136
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,700
and ensure that the deal room platform

137
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,270
has adequate auditing,

138
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,109
logging and monitoring.

139
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,760
If an attack occurs,

140
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,800
all this information is gonna be essential

141
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,290
for any ensuing,

142
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,330
data breach notification obligations

143
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,530
that both the buyer

144
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,619
and the seller

145
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,863
will need to address.

146
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,320
Deal room data retention is also

147
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,599
a very important area to consider.

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,450
Data retention has become
far more complex beast,

149
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,750
thanks to the prominence
of cloud computing,

150
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,400
data replication and the range

151
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,060
of continuous backup
products on the market.

152
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,960
This does great things

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,489
for availability of data,

154
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,580
but you also need to ask crucial questions

155
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,969
about where the data is,

156
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,070
and how long it will persist for

157
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,190
after the deal room is closed.

158
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,630
Service providers may tell you that

159
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,219
the data is exclusively encrypted

160
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,470
to your tenancy,

161
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,550
but wherever encryption is used,

162
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,030
equally you need to assess

163
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,330
the effectiveness of it,

164
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,637
because poor key management

165
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:43,340
can very quickly invalidate

166
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,032
any benefit that the
encryption provided itself.

167
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,140
Deal room access control

168
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,890
is also ultimately very important.

169
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,723
And it's probably

170
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,660
the most obvious area of weakness.

171
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,930
And unfortunately, still remains one area

172
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,810
that is poorly implemented.

173
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,200
Multi factor authentication
is an absolute must,

174
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,533
but it generally isn't
turned on by default.

175
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,090
And when it is turned on,

176
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,590
the methods employed might be very weak.

177
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,359
For convenience, most platforms offer SMS

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,710
and email methods for sharing

179
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,430
the one-time password.

180
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,380
SMS is inherently weak,

181
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,840
and has long been known

182
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,750
as not being suitable

183
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,200
for authentication methods,

184
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
and many papers have been published

185
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,930
with explicit recommendations
to not use it.

186
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,810
However, it is still extensively used.

187
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,030
Email is also generally

188
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,270
a week method for sharing
one-time passwords.

189
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,169
Specifically, when access to email itself

190
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,170
is not protected by MFA.

191
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,330
Think about this.

192
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,387
An attacker identifies

193
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,210
a party in a deal

194
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,979
who has access to the deal room.

195
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,480
This party doesn't have MFA on the email.

196
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,930
It uses email as a method

197
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,490
to get access to the MFA code

198
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,850
for the deal room.

199
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,410
The attacker only has to compromise

200
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,510
the party's email address

201
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,890
to intercept the codes

202
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,133
and ultimately access the data room.

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,610
The very best form of MFA,

204
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,170
remains a hardware token

205
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,570
that is physically separated

206
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,467
from any computer

207
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,169
or mobile device.

208
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,530
And these forms of stronger authentication

209
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,869
should be considered

210
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,950
for more sensitive

211
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,053
and high value deals.

212
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,380
Deal room application security

213
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,760
should be top of mind

214
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,900
for anybody using

215
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,210
or subscribing to a deal room service.

216
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,830
The security of the deal room itself

217
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,180
will intrinsically be related

218
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,750
to the security of the application

219
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,860
that you log into

220
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,500
and publish data in.

221
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,580
The security of the application in turn,

222
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,000
is relying generally on the way that

223
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,510
the application is hosted

224
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,420
and the controls
inherently in the platform

225
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,793
to separate the tenants,

226
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,460
as these are generally delivered

227
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,000
as multi-tenant
Software-as-a-Service products.

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,970
Will the service provider demonstrate

229
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,230
the comprehensiveness
of the security controls

230
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,760
across the development
activities that they do

231
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,978
and the operational management activities,

232
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,560
the way that they manage

233
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,170
and publish this platform
on an ongoing basis?

234
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,350
How thorough and robust is this?

235
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,200
These are all reasonable questions to ask.

236
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,280
Will they actually allow you

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,919
to appoint an expert firm

238
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,050
to conduct an independent test?

239
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,480
And do you have the
luxury of time to do this,

240
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,550
when M&A is generally
a time-bound activity?

241
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,840
If you're a buyer

242
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,159
that will be operating in the market

243
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,873
for an extended period of time,

244
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,010
across a large number of deals,

245
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,510
performing your own due diligence

246
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,849
on a data room provider,

247
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,249
maybe an inappropriate investment

248
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,623
in time and money.

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,450
Advisors also need to be considered,

250
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,380
because a buyer

251
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,880
is generally surrounded

252
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,189
by a number of advisors

253
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,770
to assist with the due diligence reviews.

254
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,319
Generally, this includes accountants,

255
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,240
lawyers, tech specialists,

256
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,640
possibly intellectual property advisors,

257
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,960
technology and insurance specialists.

258
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,483
Each one of these parties,

259
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,090
increases the risk profile

260
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,500
for both the buyer and the seller.

261
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,550
Remember that the motivated attacker

262
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,382
will be looking for

263
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,540
the weakest link in security.

264
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,140
Think back to that email example

265
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,550
that I mentioned before,

266
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,439
if an attacker

267
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,960
has profiled the advisors

268
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,590
and determines which ones

269
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,860
don't have MFA on their email,

270
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,870
they may make them the
target of the attack

271
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,016
to ultimately gain access

272
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,849
to either the buyers

273
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,263
or the sellers data in the data room.

274
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,530
Maintaining good security hygiene

275
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,140
of your deal management practices

276
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,630
is also very important.

277
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,120
Sometimes code names

278
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,380
are used to lower the profile of a deal.

279
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,780
People might call this thing,

280
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,699
I'm working on project alpha.

281
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,403
However, this security by obscurity

282
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:36,870
is generally very quickly removed

283
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,610
when that layer of security is peeled back

284
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,700
and there is inadequate excess control

285
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,690
within a business to the sensitive data.

286
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,540
So you really need robust governance,

287
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,800
risk and compliance methods internally

288
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,870
to ensure that your activities

289
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,800
that you're doing are secure.

290
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,060
And that they are
specifically restrictions

291
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,900
in place based on role
based access controls

292
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,069
and limiting things

293
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,863
on a business need to know basis.

294
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,630
If you thought it was hard work,

295
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,800
just getting to the point

296
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,969
where a deal may be consummated.

297
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,330
The hard work really only starts,

298
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,130
off the deal completion.

299
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,470
Integration of the business

300
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,300
is where the real risk is.

301
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,640
The acquirer will need to reconsider

302
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,250
if the merge business has
fundamentally changed,

303
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,640
their risk profile.

304
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,130
Has the attack footprint increased?

305
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,460
Is the current vulnerability
management practice

306
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,750
adequate to cover the large entity?

307
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,140
Do you have the right
threat intelligence in place

308
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,449
to make informed management decisions?

309
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,500
And is your position in the supply chain,

310
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,120
now under more threat?

311
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Ultimately, the business
is going to have to deal

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,850
with the machinations of integration

313
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,550
and handling the tech debt

314
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,130
that you have inherited

315
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,880
when merging two or more
established businesses.

316
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,939
I know this firsthand

317
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,090
because our business was recently acquired

318
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,936
and we are now dealing

319
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,960
with the realities of merging

320
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,963
over 13 businesses together.

321
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,150
Let's look at a couple of reference cases

322
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,500
where some organizations

323
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,680
have really suffered
through the M&A activities

324
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,829
that they've conducted.

325
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, very well publicized breach recently

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
was the Marriott-Starwood data breach.

327
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,390
This issue resulted

328
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,090
in the loss of over 380
million customer records

329
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,530
as a result of a breach

330
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,079
in the reservation system.

331
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,040
The cost of those breach

332
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,283
is reported to be more of $70 million.

333
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,940
The breach actually occurred

334
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,300
prior to the acquisition.

335
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,810
Had Marriott been aware of the breach

336
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,569
during the due diligence stage,

337
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,350
it could have been dramatically effecting

338
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,660
the vision that Marriott may have had

339
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,880
on the valuation of the party

340
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,439
that were looking to acquire

341
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,590
and possibly even the prospect

342
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,926
of a deal occurring

343
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,843
may not have transpired.

344
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,520
Telstra and PacNet, well Telstra

345
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,620
is Australia's largest
telecommunications provider,

346
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,200
and PacNet is an operator

347
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,940
of undersea cables and data centers.

348
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,703
Telstra acquired PacNet,

349
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,920
only to find out afterwards,

350
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,380
after the deal completion

351
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,200
that a breach had occurred

352
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,610
actually two weeks before
the deal had closed.

353
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,660
You'd be thinking,

354
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,370
that they might be reconsidering

355
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,750
the approach that they take

356
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,690
to cybersecurity due diligence

357
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,230
in mergers and acquisitions,

358
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,288
because if a breach was actually occurring

359
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:38,740
during the time

360
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,083
in which the due diligence was occurring,

361
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,189
that should have been brought

362
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,950
to their attention.

363
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,830
Both the seller should
have been aware of it.

364
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,970
And the buyer certainly

365
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,450
should have been able to pick up

366
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,340
on poor security controls

367
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,543
during the due diligence activities.

368
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,339
PayPal also similarly acquired

369
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,853
a payment processor TIO in 2017.

370
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,370
Only to find out later

371
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,320
that the entity

372
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
was compromised some three years earlier.

373
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,423
So as you can see,

374
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,400
there are a number

375
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,139
of case studies demonstrating

376
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:16,050
that cybersecurity due
diligence practices,

377
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,430
absolutely need to be front and center,

378
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,729
and certainly may affect
the valuation of deals.

379
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,023
And even the prospect of
a deal actually occurring.

380
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,500
Up until this point,

381
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,900
we've been focusing

382
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,420
on what buyers need to be doing

383
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,890
in terms of securing their own practices

384
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,170
in terms of their go-to-market strategies

385
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,010
of being a buyer

386
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,240
in a merger and acquisition activity.

387
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,730
Let's look now at the sell side.

388
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,750
What would the buyers be looking for

389
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,580
in terms of the sellers security?

390
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,290
And how would the buyer validate

391
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,780
if the organization

392
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,230
that they're looking to acquire

393
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,850
is actually as secure

394
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,483
as they purport to be?

395
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,640
Let's consider first supply chain.

396
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,870
Companies that are integral

397
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,537
to some function in the supply chain

398
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:10,140
are naturally very attractive to buyers

399
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,000
because they may be able

400
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,160
to get a fast return on investment

401
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,930
through a well managed
business expansion plan.

402
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,319
But they are also very
attractive to attackers,

403
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,620
because if you control the supply chain,

404
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,560
you can control the product

405
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,500
of the supply chain.

406
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,170
If anything, COVID-19
has tangibly demonstrated

407
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,670
how fragile our supply chains can be.

408
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,949
Transportation, logistics, airlines,

409
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,820
and hotels are all impacted as we speak.

410
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,330
A cybersecurity issue

411
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,380
could also result

412
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,260
in the same sort of disruption.

413
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,810
When we look at supply chains,

414
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,680
we've got to look at a number

415
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,130
of different variations

416
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,430
within the supply chain.

417
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,000
Software, are you buying or selling?

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,610
Are you developing, are you consuming?

419
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,380
Hardware, who is actually
producing the hardware?

420
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,689
Where do you get it from?

421
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,810
And which components in the hardware

422
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,250
are you actually acquiring and selling?

423
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,860
And in terms of services,

424
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,810
there have been a number
of outsourced parties.

425
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,949
in the past,

426
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,250
who have been compromised,

427
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,680
specifically, because service providers

428
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,280
generally have maintained
privileged access

429
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,850
to their customer tendencies

430
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,900
and customer environments.

431
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,310
Remote access is generally weak.

432
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,310
And as we've seen before,

433
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,969
multi factor authentication

434
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,687
is generally either not in place

435
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,910
or poorly implemented.

436
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,930
Making managed service providers

437
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,060
who are delivering services

438
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,300
on behalf of their clients

439
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,762
a very ripe target for for attackers.

440
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,890
Data is generally

441
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,060
the crown jewels of an organization.

442
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,737
Poor security around data protection

443
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,589
is likely to be the area

444
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,470
where the wheels come off

445
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,200
and things start falling apart.

446
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,830
Look at any of the
published data breaches,

447
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,320
and you will see commonalities.

448
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,190
Most organizations are still fixated

449
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,580
on perimeter security
controls like firewalls

450
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,860
and end point security
controls like antivirus.

451
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,430
But they're looking at
those things in isolation.

452
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,079
Company data exists in ecosystem.

453
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,261
And the data itself needs to be protected

454
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,010
along with the networks,

455
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,689
applications and people who access it.

456
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,440
When a buyer is assessing
a company to acquire

457
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,020
the assessment needs to validate

458
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,579
the maturity of the organization,

459
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,730
the organizational
management of their data,

460
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,160
along with the efficacy

461
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,719
of the controls implemented

462
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,260
to protect the data.

463
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,240
Examples to consider
for governance include,

464
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,900
data management models,

465
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,920
data custodians, data stewards

466
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,199
and data owners,

467
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,110
their roles and their responsibilities.

468
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,560
Is someone in the organization

469
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,069
actually accountable for data security?

470
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,630
Remember responsibilities will default

471
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,650
to the directors of the business,

472
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,829
and you can't run away from that.

473
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,250
You also got to think
about where the data is,

474
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,440
who has access to it

475
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,210
and how it is protected.

476
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,460
Encryption is still amongst the best ways

477
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,367
of protecting data.

478
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,910
But is only as good

479
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,130
as the key management around it.

480
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,630
Hard coding the decryption keys

481
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,763
into your applications

482
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:04,910
or associating the key

483
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,810
with the data that is encrypted,

484
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,179
makes protection almost useless.

485
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,380
So crypto and key management

486
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,000
are essential areas to assess.

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,170
In modern cloud

488
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,410
and an everything connected environments,

489
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,460
that it doesn't reside in one place.

490
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,700
Data is very mobile

491
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,490
and very likely to be
continuously replicating.

492
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,929
Having poor data security
practices upfront

493
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,855
can rapidly become a major problem,

494
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,690
when the data is replicated

495
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,210
across cloud environments

496
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,973
and mobile devices.

497
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,250
When assessing the security of a firm

498
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,880
that you are looking to acquire,

499
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,830
it would be a good idea

500
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,699
to validate the resilience

501
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,533
that they have

502
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,959
against common cyber attacks.

503
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,180
If the organization has

504
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,720
a robust vulnerability management program,

505
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,830
perhaps they would be open

506
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,010
to sharing the results

507
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,830
of scans and tests conducted.

508
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,149
Remember that when it
comes to penetration tests,

509
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,600
there can be a huge variation

510
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,350
in the types of tests conducted

511
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,010
and the quality of the test.

512
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,290
Penetration testing is
a specialty discipline

513
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,490
and the astute buyer

514
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,820
will need to assess the extent

515
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,770
to which the seller

516
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,060
has really tested

517
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,540
the breadth and depth of their footprint.

518
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,850
A narrow scope of a test

519
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,090
may look only at a public facing network,

520
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,840
IP addresses for example.

521
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,493
Whereas a more thorough penetration tests

522
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,850
will be looking at social engineering,

523
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,719
physical security, networks both internal,

524
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,410
external and cloud, wave applications,

525
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,710
APIs, client servers,

526
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,600
client server applications, voice over IP,

527
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,679
and a whole range

528
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,250
of other types of technologies

529
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,740
in the environment.

530
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,050
If time allows,

531
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,610
a buyer should consider appointing

532
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,080
a specialist testing firm

533
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,270
to conduct a comprehensive assessment

534
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,000
that simulates genuine cyber
security attack vectors.

535
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,713
This is often referred
to as red team testing.

536
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,940
There's also a huge difference

537
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,660
between being compliant and secure.

538
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,190
Buyers should not only rely

539
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,310
on compliance certifications alone.

540
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,860
Being compliant doesn't mean being secure.

541
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,899
Many organizations do not appreciate

542
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,924
or understand the difference

543
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,650
between the different
types of certifications

544
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,310
that exist in the marketplace.

545
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,270
For example, ISO 270001

546
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,540
is a very popular global standard

547
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,629
for information security management,

548
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,930
which is based on developing

549
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,540
a management system

550
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,310
to assess risk and implement controls,

551
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,560
to maintain risks

552
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,580
within the risk appetite

553
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,710
of the business.

554
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,800
Businesses with higher risk appetites,

555
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,300
for example, startups,

556
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,470
may be prepared to accept risks

557
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,060
that more established
businesses would not.

558
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,440
While there may be compliant

559
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,580
in terms of operating

560
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,350
a functional information
security management system,

561
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,600
this doesn't mean that the
organization is secure,

562
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,433
not at all.

563
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,660
PCI DSS on the other hand

564
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,050
is a very technically focused standard,

565
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,550
relevant specifically to merchants

566
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,970
and service providers
handling credit card data.

567
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,820
Organizations can
validate their compliance

568
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,010
by very different means

569
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,490
under this particular compliance standard,

570
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,430
through either self assessment

571
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,450
or independent assessment

572
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,180
through a qualified
security assessing company.

573
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,810
Now, there is a huge difference

574
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,643
in the confidence

575
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,200
that a buyer can deduce

576
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,230
from an independent assessment,

577
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,110
versus self-assessment.

578
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,110
Where it becomes increasingly very easy

579
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,447
and perhaps capable

580
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,680
for the organization

581
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,507
to insert a yes response

582
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,930
because it is very convenient

583
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,440
to want to be secure,

584
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,650
and self assessment

585
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,820
has no external scrutiny.

586
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,550
So you really need to
ask detailed questions

587
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,060
to get access to the
details about compliance

588
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,960
and thoroughly assess the information

589
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,013
and reporting behind the certification.

590
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,870
Let's have a look at a sample test

591
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,070
that an organization

592
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,700
may be prudent to undertake.

593
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,570
We call this

594
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,379
a dynamic risk assessment.

595
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,640
I'll give you an example here

596
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,540
of the risk assessment

597
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,700
that we were appointed

598
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,100
to conduct by a client of ours.

599
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,610
They had made a substantial investment

600
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,811
in information security over the years.

601
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,540
They operated an ISO 270001

602
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,700
information security management system

603
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,810
that acquired every type

604
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,399
of security technology you can think of,

605
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
from next gen firewalling

606
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,430
to endpoint security.

607
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,240
And it also outsourced security
operations and management

608
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,120
to 24 by seven operation centers.

609
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,669
Our client wanted to validate

610
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,503
if the controls

611
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,500
that they had so diligently implemented

612
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,980
were actually working.

613
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,460
They asked us to passively
assess their business

614
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,060
by performing reconnaissance

615
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,540
on their public footprint,

616
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,250
including, their staff access

617
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,690
and their social media profiles

618
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,090
that are publicly available.

619
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,340
We were instructed

620
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,389
to initiate targeted social
engineering architects

621
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,190
against specific individuals

622
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,700
that were likely to be targeted

623
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,943
by cyber criminals.

624
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,230
We followed this attempt

625
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,080
through further attempts

626
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,480
to gain access to their
physical office premises.

627
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,090
Again, through social engineering means.

628
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,040
A range of digital attack vectors

629
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,210
were then executed

630
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,180
with the objective of establishing

631
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,210
a presence on the corporate network

632
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,150
and then maintaining persistence

633
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,620
so that the attack could
be controlled remotely

634
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,793
from the comfort of our offices.

635
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,540
Our client wanted us to see

636
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,700
if we could determine

637
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,430
what they crowned jewels were,

638
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,420
in this case,

639
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,253
where they were,

640
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,280
and ultimately,

641
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,830
if we could access them

642
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,629
and get them out of the network.

643
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,640
This would establish

644
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,430
a worst case scenario,

645
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,490
if this was replicated

646
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,330
in a genuine cyber attack

647
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,159
with nefarious motives.

648
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,560
Our client also wanted to determine

649
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,399
if their 24 by seven
security operations center

650
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,090
would identify and prevent

651
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,562
any of the attacks from occurring.

652
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,389
Now, in this case,

653
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,660
the results of the assessment

654
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,870
were very interesting,

655
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,850
because our client

656
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,590
had generally good controls in place

657
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,750
and were very diligent

658
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,700
in their information security
management practices.

659
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,400
There were no specific vulnerabilities

660
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,810
on any networks or applications.

661
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,649
This makes execution of an attack,

662
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,900
much more difficult.

663
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,290
Because attackers generally look

664
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,990
for vulnerabilities to exploit

665
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,880
using commonly available tools,

666
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,420
to get an initial foothold
into an environment.

667
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,610
When there are no
vulnerabilities to exploit,

668
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,169
the attacker or tester,

669
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,970
needs to be far more skilled,

670
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,920
creative, and resourceful

671
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,590
in the way that they approach the problem.

672
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,639
We call this,

673
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,460
living off the land tech,

674
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,020
because you can only use

675
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,480
the tools and applications

676
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,560
that are native in their environment

677
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,610
to try and escalate your privileges

678
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,100
and work your way through

679
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,139
the maze of their environment.

680
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,130
I don't have time

681
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,820
to go through all the techniques used

682
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,320
in this particular assignment.

683
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,050
However, if you're interested in it,

684
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,550
we've written a white paper,

685
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,000
which is accessible on our webpage.

686
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,390
And you're welcome to contact me

687
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,180
after the session.

688
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,370
And I can share that information

689
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,233
with you as well.

690
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,880
In summary, we were able

691
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,970
to totally compromise their environment.

692
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,160
Move laterally across their network,

693
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,567
access their data stores,

694
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,150
exfiltrate their data

695
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,910
and decrypted it.

696
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,080
And you know what?

697
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,439
None of this was even observed

698
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,137
by the security operation center

699
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,490
that they were paying

700
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,960
a handsome penny to,

701
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,200
month after month after month.

702
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
Essentially, all their investment

703
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,150
in technology and services

704
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,140
was null and void.

705
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,990
And assessment such as this,

706
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,870
could reasonably simulate

707
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,959
the types of attacks

708
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,310
that an organization may be subjected to

709
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,730
by motivated detectives post acquisition.

710
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,530
Indeed, the organization

711
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,290
may have already been compromised

712
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,700
through such techniques.

713
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,620
As you could see,

714
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,520
through the examples

715
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,353
of the case studies

716
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,460
that I shared with you previously.

717
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,020
Such an assessment,

718
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,240
could completely change the perspective

719
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,150
of the buyer

720
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,560
in terms of the risk

721
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,379
and value of the target,

722
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,770
and therefore make the legal

723
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,893
and financial due diligence less relevant.

724
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,843
Let's now look

725
00:25:05,843 --> 00:25:07,620
at applying the learnings

726
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,180
that we've identified today,

727
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,500
to practical outcomes

728
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,140
for both buyers and sellers.

729
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,433
On the buyer side,

730
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,090
you should be looking

731
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,730
in a very short period of time

732
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,163
to assessing data room technologies.

733
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,149
Make your selection based on capability,

734
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,200
resilience, track record,

735
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,210
authentication capabilities and

736
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,670
also access control options.

737
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,760
You should also be looking to identify

738
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,260
your third party footprint.

739
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,100
Remember that the third parties

740
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,540
are increasing your risk profile

741
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,490
in the marketplace.

742
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,630
And attackers will be looking

743
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,850
to exploit the weakest link in the chain.

744
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,870
So think about the security

745
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,520
that your lawyers have in place,

746
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,210
your accountants and
your external advisors,

747
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,810
and you may need to elevate

748
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,570
their capabilities as well,

749
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,360
if you're going to be working with them

750
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,290
on an ongoing basis.

751
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,409
Within the first three months,

752
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,571
following this presentation,

753
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,649
you should be in the position

754
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,590
to establish firm protocol

755
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,020
for data room access,

756
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,020
including third party
security controls as well.

757
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,889
You should be able

758
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,240
to validate the security

759
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,260
of your third party ecosystem.

760
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,140
You should also be able

761
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,250
to implement robust
cybersecurity assessment plans

762
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,140
for the acquisitions

763
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,130
that you plan to do
currently and going forward.

764
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,160
And you should also

765
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,620
be able to test

766
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,050
your own incident management

767
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,600
and response capability.

768
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,833
Remember that as a buyer,

769
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,700
your risk profile increases

770
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,240
as you become known in the marketplace

771
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,510
for looking for acquisitions,

772
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,090
particularly if they are high profile,

773
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,240
high value and sensitive acquisitions,

774
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,963
possibly with nation state interest.

775
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,370
Let's look now at the sell side as well.

776
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,030
If you're a seller next week,

777
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,280
you should be able to be prepared

778
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,669
to respond to a more astute buyer.

779
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,350
Assess the data room technologies.

780
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,260
As I mentioned before, on the sell side.

781
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,280
You should, if you're in control

782
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,160
of your go-to-market strategy,

783
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,580
you should be selecting

784
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,860
the data room based on

785
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,690
the service providers capability,

786
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,000
their resilience, their track record,

787
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,160
and their authentication

788
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,700
and access control options.

789
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,910
Remember, you should be enforcing

790
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,230
the strongest form of authentication.

791
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,690
So that any buyer

792
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,760
or interested party

793
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,450
and their ecosystem,

794
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,000
should not be compromising

795
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,760
your security of the data

796
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,430
that you're posting into the data room

797
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,100
when you're in control of it.

798
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,270
You should also be preparing

799
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,629
your go-to-market approach.

800
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,750
So they buyers will be
following your lead.

801
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,340
So you should be specifying

802
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,899
the forms of authentication

803
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,500
and role based access control

804
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,310
that you want to minimize

805
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,719
the exposure of your data

806
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,630
in your data room.

807
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,610
Remember that you shouldn't

808
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,850
be publishing legal
information to accountants,

809
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,260
and you shouldn't be providing,

810
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,450
exposing accounting information

811
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,930
to lawyers unless,

812
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,300
there is a specific business need to know.

813
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,442
Within three months
following this presentation,

814
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:12,470
you should be able

815
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,010
to appoint a firm

816
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,000
to conduct a red team test

817
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,310
or dynamic risk assessment.

818
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,940
Similar to the one that I mentioned

819
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,460
a couple of minutes ago.

820
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,910
This is the best way

821
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,580
of validating your compliance position

822
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,350
and mapping the technical controls

823
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,139
against whether or not
they're actually working.

824
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,400
Remember, being compliant

825
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,640
and being secure

826
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,020
are totally different prospects.

827
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,710
You should be able to demonstrate

828
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,880
that your incident management activities,

829
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,550
your response is effective.

830
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,560
And you should ensure that

831
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,149
when you've got outsourced
IT security management,

832
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,520
that your service providers

833
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,389
are doing a thorough, good

834
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,010
and comprehensive job for you.

835
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,360
The best way of doing this

836
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,193
is by running

837
00:28:55,193 --> 00:29:00,030
a cybersecurity simulation tech simulation

838
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,280
by an expert firm.

839
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,580
And within six months,

840
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,413
you should be able

841
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:06,310
to implement threat management

842
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,840
and continuous monitoring to demonstrate

843
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,679
your ongoing visibility
of security issues.

844
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,420
So that there are no surprises

845
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,120
for the buyers.

846
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,669
With that, I'm gonna
close off the session.

847
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,907
It's been a great pleasure to be with you.

848
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm Murray Goldschmidt,

849
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,060
the executive director
for cyber capability,

850
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,120
education and training at cyberCX.

851
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,870
My contact details are on the screen now.

852
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,939
Feel free to contact me
after the presentation.

853
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,630
I also hope that you've been using

854
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,930
the on room chat

855
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,440
and I'll be able

856
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,610
to respond to those things now.

857
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,233
Thank you very much. Take care.
