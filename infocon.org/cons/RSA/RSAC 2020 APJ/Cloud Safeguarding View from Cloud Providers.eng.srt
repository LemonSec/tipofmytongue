00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,820
- Hello and welcome to Cloud Safeguarding:

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,250
View from Cloud Providers.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,660
I'm Britta Glade, Director
of Content and Curation

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,040
for RSA Conference

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,260
and I'll be the moderator
for this session.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,959
First a bit of housekeeping.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,970
If you're joining us live, our panelists

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,770
are in the slido chat discussion area

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,810
answering your questions right now.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,410

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,630
I'm joined today by
three fantastic experts,

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,099
Myles Hosford is
Principal, Head of Security

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Architecture ASEAN AWS.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,760
Mark Johnston is APAC Head
of Security for Google,

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,769
and Abbas Kudrati is the
Chief Security Officer

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,930
APJ for Microsoft.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,330
Our session and the questions
we'll be exploring today

19
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,580
are based on dialogue and work
that RSA Conference has done

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,290
with the CISO community.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,310
Zeroing in on concepts and
questions that have been raised

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,080
by this important community.

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,850
We've broken our conversation
today into three key areas,

24
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,270
with a few questions that
each of our panelists

25
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,720
will be addressing, with
a goal of equipping you

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,099
with some good strategies
and best practices

27
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,372
for Cloud Safeguarding.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,620
I'll start our discussion
today with the first question,

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,950
directed to all of our
panelists, starting with Mark

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,440
and then Myles, and then Abbas.

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,860
Mark, what are the top three
to five security benefits

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,133
to an organization for moving
to a public cloud environment?

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,500
- Thanks Britta and,

34
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,030
for me, number one has to be

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,560
resource optimization, the
ability to remove tasks

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,000
that provide high toil, but low business

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,850
that value to your organization,
like patching firmware

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,100
or underlying computing infrastructure,

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,919
or networking equipment that
is not always easy to manage.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,810
Tracking models and benders
and vulnerabilities or CBAs

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,110
across your fleet of infrastructure.

42
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,120
This reduces the attack surface area

43
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,150
that you need to monitor,
manage, and protect,

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,740
and allows you to optimize

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,660
those valuable security
resources and skills

46
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,009
that you just can't get enough of

47
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,459
to protect your organization.

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,770
Secondly, resilience and availability.

49
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,900
High availability and disaster occur rate

50
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,680
are really challenging aspects,

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,980
and often extremely expensive.

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,420
With cloud services,
they're configuration items,

53
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,572
not complex procurement
and finance discussions.

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,590
Your ability to leverage
the hyper-scale defenses,

55
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,170
like distributed denial of service,

56
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,780
massive network to connect resiliency,

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,400
multiple zones and regions,

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,150
business spun up and spun down

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,573
with very little lead time
or capital expenditure.

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,710
And lastly, those CSPs
have huge investments

61
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,260
in security itself, much
larger than many enterprises

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,320
can afford to spend themselves.

63
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,780
You're able to leverage the
native investments they've made

64
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,240
in their platform and the
partnerships they've made

65
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,230
with third party technology providers

66
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,390
to bring some of your existing
technology and security stack

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,399
to manage it the way you want to,

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
as well as leverage some of the

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,170
built-in security capabilities
such as encryption standards

70
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,559
and strengths that they bring

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
to their services consistently.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,920
Such as native logging capabilities

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,200
that have always been
traditionally harder on-prem.

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,822
Now I'll pass to the next person.

75
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,180
- [Britta] Myles?

76
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,470
- [Myles] Thanks Britta,
thanks Mark, and I'm gonna go

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,080
for three benefits also, and
I think my first one will echo

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,350
what Mark closed with there
around the investments

79
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,590
that cloud providers make
in their security posture.

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,720
You probably hear about being called

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,180
the shared responsibility
model potentially,

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,250
where the cloud providers are responsible

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,500
for hundreds of controls
across the environment

84
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,100
that you as a customer, often
have the key benefit from

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,239
on day one of using the platform.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,050
So if you move a proof
of concept application

87
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,670
or a mission critical application to AWS

88
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,440
on other cloud providers
like Google and Microsoft,

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,130
you already benefit from those
controls that already exist.

90
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,960
Typically, those controls would be audited

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,769
by third party auditors,
giving you the insurance

92
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,820
that those controls meet

93
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,670
your high standards and expectations.

94
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,043
The second benefit that
I'd like to focus on

95
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,690
and it's really one that I
think is fantastic for customers

96
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,413
moving to public cloud,
is the level of visibility

97
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,750
that security organizations
get from their environment.

98
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,590
Now typically, on premise environments,

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,729
it's very hard to get insight

100
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,220
into all the different activity

101
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,850
across your networks
and application stacks.

102
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,453
So as developers and
engineers are making changes,

103
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,620
historically, security
teams have struggled

104
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,070
collecting all of those
different data sources,

105
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,340
and analyzing what's
happened in their network.

106
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,159
In the cloud environment,
it's very easy to determine

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
what's happened, who
performed the activity,

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,790
and what was the result of that change?

109
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,850
So for example, if someone
makes a modification

110
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,890
to your network, alters
your firewall settings

111
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,380
to expose vulnerable
service to the Internet,

112
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,360
very often that sort of
activity can be detected

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,993
very, very fast and
responded to in real time.

114
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,109
Which takes me onto my third benefit

115
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,060
and something I think you'll hear

116
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,490
from most of the speakers today

117
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,070
around the use of automation

118
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,210
to protect your cloud environment.

119
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,609
Now cloud is essentially
a collection of API's

120
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,360
and because it's API's, you
can move to an event-driven

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,780
security model, which can be reactive

122
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,219
and protect your
environment against threats

123
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,250
and incidents as they happen.

124
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,030
So my earlier example of someone

125
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,119
modifying a firewall setting
or changing a network,

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,990
if you have the visibility
to detect that in real time,

127
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,350
combined with the
automation and the benefit

128
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,800
from security via API's,
you can essentially

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,163
remediate the security misconfigurations

130
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:51,887
and incidents as they
happen in your environment

131
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,340
and not have to wait
kind of weeks or months

132
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,053
to determine that these events occurred,

133
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,803
like you would traditionally
in an on-premise environment.

134
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,686
Over to you.

135
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,289
(signal sound)

136
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,969
- [Britta] Excellent, Abbas.

137
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,390
- Thank you Myles and Mark,
I think I would be going over

138
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,930
all of the points which you covered

139
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,470
and I think there's a similarity

140
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,085
of most of the cloud service providers.

141
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,330
But I thought I'll share my perspective,

142
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,010
being a chief security
information officer,

143
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,870
the things which I used to more focus on

144
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,290
when I had everything on-premises right?

145
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll take an example
of a threat management.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,220
So I had to wait until my
vendor released the patch

147
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,570
and I need to work around
with multiple venders

148
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,250
to fix something if I have threat

149
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,870
or any malware infection in my network.

150
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,250
But today, if I'm using
the cloud-based solution,

151
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,860
it would be a cloud based ADR,
I can use the power of cloud

152
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,560
and get quickly remediated
because they are operating

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,700
at a very hyper-scale or speed, right?

154
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,270
When it comes to threat
management, the minutes matters,

155
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,510
so you need to have something which can

156
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,599
be immediatelty remediated
across the board

157
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,212
and we are seeing those examples

158
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,710
of some of the big
ransomwares and malware,

159
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,933
such as Bad Rabbit.

160
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,150
Second one being, being a
CISO, I had a huge challenge

161
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,030
of how do I maintain I
compliance requirement

162
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,880
for a number of regulatory
bodies in my company?

163
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,460
But having now working with
passing those responsibilities

164
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,750
towards the cloud service provider,

165
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,870
they are now taking care
of most of the control

166
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,600
when it comes to the
compliance requirement,

167
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,370
could be ISO 27,001, PCI-DSS,
or could be APRA requirement

168
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,940
in Australia as such, right?

169
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,300
So I can take advantage of
shifting the responsibility of

170
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,680
compliance and security towards
my cloud service provider.

171
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Third, being having the
flexibility of elasticity

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,119
and pay as you go, I don't
need to make a huge investment

173
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,172
in infrastructure and security
product right from the

174
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,740
beginning because as you
know, if you buy your security

175
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,820
solutions and we hardly use
a 25 to 50% of the capability

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,870
and rest of the capabilities
are not even being utilized.

177
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,668
Under VPN we pay 100% of the cost.

178
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,020
and having those features
now in the cloud,

179
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,299
you pay for the features which are using

180
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,310
rather than paying 100% to those area.

181
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,930
So which gives a huge advantage
to the CISOS saying that

182
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,950
in terms of, how much they
can realize they can use the

183
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,039
investment for something different,

184
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,130
and having that flexibility of
using those built in security

185
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,183
within the cloud service
provider ecosystem, you know,

186
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,813
and last but not the least,
I think we all have agreed on

187
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,490
on spoken about is investment which

188
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,424
cloud service providers make right?

189
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:38,069
You don't need to worry about
having data center security

190
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,809
as an example all the CCTV
cameras and biometrics and

191
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,972
whatnot, all these things
are now transferred to them.

192
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:48,700
And Mark talked about a
firmware level security

193
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,510
hand on hand if you ask any
CISO, so how many times do they

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,720
do a firmware level purchase?

195
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,690
You will not get the answer as a yes,

196
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,350
they hardly, they ignore it.

197
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,021
And we have seen in the past right?

198
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,290
we have seen lots of ATM which was

199
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,449
targeting at the firmware level.

200
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,186
But now that cloud service
provider is managing your VMS

201
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:06,730
and everything as the
infrastructural service,

202
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,080
they take care of a
firmware level security.

203
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,900
So you can sleep well
in the night as a CISO.

204
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,990
Right?

205
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,357
Over to you Britta

206
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,510
- So for our next set of
three questions will direct

207
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,730
the conversation to Abbas
and encourage all of the rest

208
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,470
of you to participate in Slido
in the discussion with all

209
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,690
of our panelists who are here.

210
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,720
Abbas how should a CISO
organization staff for cloud

211
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,980
security, what are the various
roles across architecture

212
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,740
engineering and operations
required for success?

213
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,709
- [Abbas] Absolutely.

214
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,677
Thanks Britta.

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,010
As we have seen, the
the whole journey from

216
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,183
on-prem to cloud is transforming, right?

217
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:49,880
I mean, we call it from legacy to cloud.

218
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,230
And we have seen the evolvement
in architecture space,

219
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,870
the tooling, the skills and practice.

220
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,373
And if you look at the few of the changes,

221
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,610
what we see is the
architecture is changed.

222
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,430
But the principle and outcome
still remains the same.

223
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,592
When it comes to roles and responsibility,

224
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,530
the skills will evolve right?

225
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,161
And same thing goes with the control,

226
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,720
the control and tools and
process will also evolve

227
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,280
and also some of the roles
will still remain the same,

228
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,510
some will change and some
roles will be completely new.

229
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,334
As we have seen that now, we
are running a kind of a new

230
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:26,579
parameter right every organizations
who is now doing a shift

231
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,490
from on-prem to the digital transformation

232
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,040
or to the cloud journey, they
will they will have a classic

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,170
parameter as we call it
the network-based control.

234
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,270
And they will there is
another parameter we call it,

235
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,510
which is a modern parameter,

236
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,303
which is an identity-based control.

237
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,570
And that's why we are seeing the evolution

238
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,950
of those variables, roles
and responsibility from a

239
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,306
legacy architecture an
operating model to a

240
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:51,163
modern architecture operating model.

241
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:53,730
To give an example, the
security role which has been

242
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,100
shifting now from a manual
resource administration,

243
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,810
which as our admin you should do it.

244
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,290
They are now focusing on
being an author and owning

245
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,040
and more automation part
similarly our network team,

246
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,719
which was focusing on network containment.

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,580
Now they are focusing on
containment at all the layers

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,210
which includes network application

249
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,570
identity data and whatnot.

250
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,410
Similarly, the development
team, which was focusing more

251
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,069
on security team was more
focused with development team

252
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,520
on a quality check before release,

253
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,459
Now they are working as an
SME in a DevOps process.

254
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,300
And DevOps process in a continuous

255
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,900
evolution based project.

256
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,760
Our architecture team which
used to be more focused on

257
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,980
a project based engagement before,

258
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,060
now they're focusing on a
continuous engagement and

259
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,890
continuous improvement for
the kind of new role which we

260
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,340
are seeing is Business
Information Security Officer

261
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,990
or BISO as we call it, we
are seeing more of a cloud

262
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,210
solution architect, the
cloud security architect,

263
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,990
we are seeing the new roles
popping up based on identity

264
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,690
and access management,
which is ideal specialist

265
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,290
as we are talking about
identity as a new perimeter,

266
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,930
we are seeing a specific security
analyst which are focusing

267
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,329
on cloud based threats and
cloud based alerts, right?.

268
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,400
Before the focus of
security analysts was more

269
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,100
network-centric and on-prem.

270
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,520
Now they need to understand there're

271
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,960
threats coming from Cloud.

272
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,570
So there is a set of skill
sets which are required

273
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,010
on focusing on cloud based
threats and we call it

274
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,400
cloud security analysis in that area.

275
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,860
So these are the some of the
new things and the evolution

276
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,215
of roles and responsibilities
we are seeing

277
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:34,980
when when things are moving,
when our organization is now

278
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,913
changing, especially for
information security officer.

279
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,538
Over to yo Britta

280
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,350
- Thanks, thanks Abbas.

281
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,360
So for the next question, if
you could address it for me,

282
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,630
why is it important to
understand shared responsibility

283
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,730
when moving to a public cloud environment?

284
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,955
(Abbas laughs)

285
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:56,788
- Very good question.

286
00:12:56,788 --> 00:13:01,788
I would say shared responsibilty
goes a long way with all

287
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,390
the cloud service provider
what we have here.

288
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,063
But one thing we need
to really understand is

289
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,240
responsibility versus accountability.

290
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,900
And I like the analogy of a bank right?

291
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,730
So, you go to bank to keep
your money safe, right?

292
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,100
You go and deposit in the bank,

293
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,670
bank will take care of the money,

294
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,030
but how you spend is your call.

295
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,380
That's where the accountability
kind of comes in, Right?

296
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,553
So yes, cloud service providers are having

297
00:13:26,553 --> 00:13:28,880
a model based on the
service which you use,

298
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,770
could be Infrastructure as a Service,

299
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,360
platform as a service or
a software as a service.

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,800
And the cloud responsibility
keeps changing

301
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,560
responsibility of the
security and other areas keeps

302
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,969
changing based on the
service that you use.

303
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,890
For example, if you are using
just infrastructured service,

304
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,890
then physical layer and to hardware layer

305
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,949
is the responsibility
of a service provider.

306
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,800
And if you are using the
software as a service,

307
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,990
then everything from physical
layer two operating system

308
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,880
layer to application purchase,
all those responsibility

309
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,550
are shifted towards them.

310
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,593
But you need to understand that,

311
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,017
you are responsible for
identity and the data,

312
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,910
the cloud service provider
is not going to take

313
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,329
responsibility of how
you classify the data.

314
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,290
Yes, they provide you all
the controls and technology

315
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,189
in meeting for managing those security.

316
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,470
But you need to define
in terms of what my data

317
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,520
classification is based on
the sensitivity and clarity

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,460
How am I going to store it?

319
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,650
Where do I store, archive
and all those things,

320
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,410
including encryption.

321
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,949
And the second important
part is identity and access

322
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,810
management, who you going to
provide the access to them

323
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,280
role of the access control,

324
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,060
or any other mechanism you have.

325
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,329
So you need to really
understand in that area, right?

326
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,580
And you are using those

327
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,920
enriching signals from them.

328
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,050
So if your cloud service
provider is giving you access to

329
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,900
the API's and collecting those signals,

330
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,930
and alerts and pushing it
back in your on-prem Sim,

331
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,670
or a cloud based Sim, then
the monitoring responsibility

332
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,319
also relies, joint responsibility.

333
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,940
There are certain things
which cloud service provider

334
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,740
takes care for you, but there
are areas of monitoring and

335
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,292
alerting, which you need to configure

336
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,270
and use it on your side.

337
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,933
So understand the built in,
of security control which

338
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:14,189
they provide, but Mark talk
about in initial pitch,

339
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,520
the configuration part, right?

340
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,740
You are still responsible for
fine tuning in configuring

341
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,377
and managing it in your environment

342
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:23,194
the way you want to use it.

343
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:27,103
So, yeah, you have the
keys, but how you keep,

344
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:30,023
how you keep those keys safely.

345
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,033
It's your responsibility here.

346
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,217
Example of should not keep
your keys under the doormat.

347
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,220
You to have the keys to the kingdom,

348
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,970
or keys to the cloud
service provider, tenancy,

349
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,870
what you're using, it's
your responsibility to

350
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,570
safeguard those keys as well.

351
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,730
Over to you Britta.

352
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,140
- Excellent, yeah, it's
big questions hard to hit

353
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,920
in a little short, short segment.

354
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,490
So final question for you in this segment,

355
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,390
which is how can organizations
gain assurance that the

356
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,130
service provider's side of
the shared responsibility

357
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,490
implements appropriate controls.

358
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,450
Are these controls verified and audited

359
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,900
by independent third parties?

360
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,043
- Absolutely.

361
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:13,690
So, any cloud service
for the given the time

362
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,240
they have to comply with a
number of these regulatory

363
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,940
bodies, the compliance body
in the industry specific

364
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,100
requirement and all.

365
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,280
And we have a principle, right,

366
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,449
we call it, Trust but verify.

367
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,230
Now being a cloud service provider,

368
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,100
it is very hard for, hard
to allow each and every

369
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,330
organization to come and
audit you if they have a

370
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,940
third party security Assurance Framework.

371
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,880
However, there are
organizations giving the example

372
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,500
of Microsoft of course
you have a right to audit,

373
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,853
but you need to subscribe
to that right and,

374
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:47,900
and go and do the audit.

375
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,500
Otherwise, there's a
concept of trust but verify,

376
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:54,880
where the cloud service provider is hiding

377
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,250
their independent auditor.

378
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,593
It could be from one of
the big four organizations

379
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,939
or could be a regulatory body themselves,

380
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,670
they come in audit against
all those control framework

381
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,819
could be ISO, PCI, APRA
and GDPR and whatnot.

382
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,200
And these independent audit
report are being hosted

383
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,848
on a public repository site.

384
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:19,179
To give an example Service
Trust Portal is an example

385
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,680
from Microsoft site where
they can go and download those

386
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
assessment report and certificate
which are independently

387
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,630
issued by the third party auditor,

388
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,900
and they can verify which controls are

389
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,960
tested and being
responsible from CSP side,

390
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,580
and which are the control which,

391
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,840
our customer is responsible
for implementing.

392
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,840
If they need to comply to, for
example, NIST 800-53, right?

393
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,330
Thousand plus controls in them.

394
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,580
But if Microsoft takes care of

395
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,360
our route three service
provider in this case,

396
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,158
takes care of 63 to 73% of the control,

397
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,820
but the remaining part
is, you need to focus on

398
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,996
because those controls
I was talking about,

399
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,410
During our shared services model,

400
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,520
they can't be taken care of that

401
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,878
it's your responsibility in the area.

402
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,439
And there are mechanisms
such as the secure scorecard,

403
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,460
where you can go and have a look at which,

404
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,760
is what is the current
compliance for my environment,

405
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,850
or my tenancy or my subscription,

406
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,260
which can give me give me a visibility of

407
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,540
of all the control
which has been passed by

408
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,889
the service provider and
which are the control

409
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,500
which I need to focus on.

410
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,860
So trust but verify is
something, a principle which

411
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,433
all the cloud service
providers are working towards.

412
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,445
Over to you Britta.

413
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,930
- [Britta] Excellent.

414
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,680
Okay, thank you, Abbas.

415
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,310
Myles, I'm gonna bring you
into the conversation here

416
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,240
with the next three questions,
reminding our participants

417
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,020
that all of our panelists
are in the chat area.

418
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,430
Myles a question for you.

419
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,120
For security controls the
customer is required to implement

420
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,659
what sources of best practices
or industry frameworks

421
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,320
can CISO teams leverage?

422
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,659
NIST CSF,

423
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,317
CIS, Top 20,

424
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,323
PCI-DSS, etc.

425
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,030
- [Myles] Thank you Britta.

426
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,170
So yeah, cloud control frameworks.

427
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,920
This is a very interesting
topic that I spend a lot of my

428
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,960
time at the moment talking
with CISOs and security teams

429
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,560
around the region

430
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,250
And I think if we go back
kind of, you know, many years,

431
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,730
the focus of the security
teams was ensuring the trust

432
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,663
and verification as Abbas
has just been talking about,

433
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:37,090
you know, understanding
that the cloud is secure.

434
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,020
Understanding the controls of
the cloud provider has built

435
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,330
for you and has audited and
I think once an organization

436
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,030
has kind of gone through that process,

437
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,080
then it's really time for
them to start thinking about

438
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,230
how to build their own control framework

439
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,340
that is suitable for the cloud.

440
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,459
So while each cloud provider
will have prescriptive

441
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,800
best practices, that are
specific and unique to the

442
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,200
platform and services,
and unique capabilities,

443
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,710
A sensible approach for CISO I think,

444
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,640
is to build a control framework
which uses a common set of

445
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,630
controls or a common set
of control objectives.

446
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,970
So things like assets and
software should be inventoried,

447
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,060
or data should be encrypted
at transit and at rest.

448
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,740
These are some good examples
of control objectives

449
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,110
that are kind of platform
agnostic or holistic across

450
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,689
technology providers and
they aren't specific to a

451
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,890
particular vendor, but they do provide

452
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,900
a good security outcome.

453
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,810
Now organizations can build a
security standard with these

454
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,340
control objectives that
can be used across their

455
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,980
organization with a single
taxonomy and Nomenclature.

456
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,977
Everybody knows what control you know,

457
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,940
one should be doing.

458
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,287
And these controls then
can be adopted across your

459
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,460
different technology partners,

460
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,750
your different cloud providers,

461
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,670
and also different types of cloud as well,

462
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,940
whether that's the
infrastructure as a service,

463
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,650
platform as a service, or even SAS.

464
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,310
So let's say as a CISO you've
developed kind of a list of

465
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,200
these hundreds Common control objectives,

466
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,420
you don't really mind where
the data in the system lands,

467
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,720
you know, if the business has
it has a business case to move

468
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
it on a particular platform.

469
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,760
But what you do really care
about is that those control

470
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,190
objectives are filled and completed, Okay?

471
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,850
So if you have, you know,
that example of data must be

472
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,000
encrypted at rest and in transit.

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,597
It shouldn't be acceptable
if one platform you know,

474
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,810
you can't achieve that or
the particular SAS platform,

475
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,090
you can't achieve that
if that's your objective

476
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,169
to protect the confidentiality,
integrity and availability

477
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,110
of the data, then, you know,
we need to make sure that

478
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,127
there's a method to do that or
you have mitigating controls

479
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,210
and a risk a risk management
framework otherwise.

480
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,970
So for organizations following
this kind of control,

481
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,280
objective approach,
where can you get started

482
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
with a list of sensible
common control objectives.

483
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,560
Well, first of all, this
will largely depend on your

484
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,610
organization and what various obligations

485
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,300
and requirements that you have.

486
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,293
So those obligations may come
from a variety of sources.

487
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Typically, organizations
will have obligations

488
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,760
from their existing on-premise
or internal policies.

489
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,550
So you may have an access
control policy that stipulates,

490
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,930
you know, all privileged
access must use multi factor

491
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,390
authentication, for example.

492
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,670
You might also have, policies
around data protection,

493
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,520
which mandates what sort of
ciphers and keys and algorithms

494
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,120
are used in your organization
to protect the data.

495
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,889
So there's definitely a set of obligations

496
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,390
that you already have to meet.

497
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,230
Secondly, you very likely
if you're an enterprise

498
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,040
have obligations potentially
from a regulatory body.

499
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,090
So here in Singapore, for
example, you will have the

500
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,600
Monetary Authority of
Singapore, which has the various

501
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,649
guidelines around technology,
risk management, outsourcing,

502
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,700
and more recently, the cyber
hygiene notice to ensure

503
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,610
that you're uplifting
your security posture.

504
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,937
As Abbas mentioned earlier, obviously,

505
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:49,149
you're in further in
the region in Australia.

506
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,560
There's definitely requirements
coming out from APRA

507
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,760
and other financial
regulators around the region.

508
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,260
From an industry perspective,
you will have obligations

509
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,460
and requirements from things like PCI-DSS

510
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,370
If you're in the payment card industry,

511
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,850
or even HIPAA, if you're
processing healthcare

512
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,510
and medical records.

513
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,140
so another common approach is to

514
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,700
leverage industry frameworks like

515
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,920
the NIST cybersecurity framework.

516
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,030
So the NIST cybersecurity
framework provides 98 control

517
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,610
objectives across five core
security functions of identify,

518
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,939
protect, detect, respond and recover.

519
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,040
So there's going to be, you
know, a really good place to

520
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,290
start for organizations.

521
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,620
If you've collected those
three different groups

522
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,050
of requirements and obligations,
you can start thinking

523
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,760
about your common set
of control requirements.

524
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,210
So there's gonna be a lot of overlap

525
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,000
against those three sources as well.

526
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,310
So for example,

527
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,310
in your

528
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,340
internal policy,

529
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,040
I suspect that you have
requirements around encryption

530
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,680
in your regulatory requirements,

531
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,530
there will definitely be
your data must be encrypted

532
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,100
And certifications like
programs like PCI-DSS

533
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,040
will also require for encryption.

534
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,860
So in your control framework,
you could essentially

535
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,879
have a single control
that says data should be

536
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,610
encrypted at rest and in transit.

537
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,409
Which effectively meets
a wider set a one to many

538
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,130
relationship back to
your control frameworks.

539
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,260
So once you have a well
defined control framework

540
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,040
with holistic control objectives,

541
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,100
it will then be time to
ensure that these controls

542
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,409
are defined, built and
operating effectively

543
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,210
for your platform of choice.

544
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,760
At this point, the implementation
procedure will become

545
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,220
platform specific.

546
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,320
So I've mentioned a couple
of times the example of data

547
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,169
protection of course, you can
encrypt your data across all

548
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,380
platforms that we
talking about here today.

549
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,130
But how you specifically do
that will depend on the platform

550
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,350
that you are choosing,

551
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,669
and also the service within that platform.

552
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,380
So for example, the way that
we do encryption at Amazon

553
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,740
on our Amazon S3 object store
will be slightly different

554
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,900
to the way that we do it on our

555
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,010
relational databases, for example.

556
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,610
So it's important for security teams,

557
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,300
I believe, to not only
provide the control objective

558
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,260
frameworks, but work with
the application teams

559
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,240
to ensure that they have the
procedures and the detailed

560
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,463
out to how to effectively enact
that control in the cloud.

561
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,080
I think it's also important as Abbas,

562
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,129
has mentioned I market
myself a couple of times now

563
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,580
that there is this shared
responsibility model.

564
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,370
So although you may have
your entire kind of control

565
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,989
framework, many parts of
that control framework

566
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,840
might already be completed
by the service provider.

567
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,730
So things like physical security,

568
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,290
potentially denial of service,

569
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,790
you know, physical security of the

570
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,000
data centers and the global platform.

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,970
You still want those controls to be there,

572
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,100
but you're not responsible
for implementing them.

573
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,620
So very important to remember that.

574
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,959
And finally, for controls
that need to be implemented

575
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,907
by your organization as part
of your responsibility model

576
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:41,169
in the cloud, these can often
be split into two different

577
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,680
groups, so preventative
controls and detective controls.

578
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,040
Preventative controls in the
cloud are usually enforced

579
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,760
using identity and access management,

580
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,650
which I'm gonna talk about in a moment,

581
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,829
that really prevent your users
from making misconfigurations

582
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:56,399
and introducing risk
into your environment.

583
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,310
And detective controls are
typically the result of an event

584
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,379
driven secure posture, where
you're using the visibility

585
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,080
in real time automation
that I mentioned previously,

586
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,429
to detect these events
as fast as possible,

587
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,930
and mitigate them using
cloud native technologies.

588
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,210
Thanks Britta.

589
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,880
- Okay, let's go identity.

590
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,210
My roots are in identity.

591
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,380
So I love I love anything
in and around identity.

592
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,030
So why is identity so important

593
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,180
in a public cloud environment?

594
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,993
What are some best practices to consider?

595
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,790
- Yeah, a good question.

596
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,580
And I think it was really
interesting what Abbas

597
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,449
mentioned earlier around seeing
a shift in CISO is kind of

598
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,239
organizational structure to
start hiring kind of identity

599
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,130
architects or Cloud Identity architects,

600
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,630
because, you notice

601
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,350
it is such a primary control in the cloud.

602
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,416
So yeah, as I previously mentioned,

603
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,310
you know, when we split these
control frameworks into two,

604
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,590
you typically will have your
preventative and detective

605
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,433
control in your public cloud environment.

606
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:53,560
And let's talk about why
that is why that is so.

607
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,129
So first of all, if you
wanted to build a new system

608
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,220
in an on-premise environment,
you would kind of initially

609
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,040
go into your data center physically,

610
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,190
you would physically rack
and stack the, you know,

611
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,870
potentially the hardware
and your machines you would

612
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,949
physically connect it to the network,

613
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,210
potentially bootstrap in
operating system and the

614
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,970
application technology stack.

615
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,130
And then finally, kind of
add users and integrate that

616
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,625
operating system and
application to your to your,

617
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,740
you know, your wider
Active Directory or your,

618
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,360
your application user base.

619
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,689
And so historically,
identity has been one of the

620
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,320
last things still very important,

621
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,020
but one of the last things to do

622
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
in a configurational environment.

623
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,740
Now, when a cloud environment
identity is typically

624
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,500
the very first thing that you do,

625
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,020
you need to sign up to
your cloud providers have,

626
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,060
you know, console a web application,

627
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,750
and then you create users
that can access your service

628
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,120
providers control plane, and
then you permission those users

629
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,550
to access resources and deploy servers and

630
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,450
operating systems and modify the network.

631
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,830
So in the cloud environment,
identity is typically

632
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,793
the very first thing and
it's really critical to get

633
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:57,889
the rights to ensure that
you enforce best practices

634
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,700
like separations of duties,
principle of least privileges.

635
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,060
So talking more specifically
about some best practices,

636
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,020
then, I think can something
that I see successful

637
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,780
cloud migrations is when
you have a central identity

638
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,180
provider to manage your
users in a single location.

639
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,550
Ideally, you would use this
identity provider across

640
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,320
platforms, and third party
applications, including SAS.

641
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,439
This makes it easier for
your employees to interact

642
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,920
with the cloud, they only
have to remember essentially

643
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,060
one set of credentials.

644
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,347
And there's also benefits
for the security team here.

645
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:30,610
And that first of all, as I mentioned,

646
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,620
users don't write down
multiple different passwords

647
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,679
or share passwords across
multiple different providers

648
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,880
which might introduce
risks from a data breach,

649
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,810
or you know, potentially one of them.

650
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,590
But also you have the ability
to very easily interact with

651
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,970
your existing kind of movers,
leavers and joiners processes.

652
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,757
So if someone was part of your cloud team,

653
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:53,230
and then maybe moved roles
or left your organization,

654
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,470
typically it's very easy
then to just deactivate

655
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,810
that resource in a centrally managed IDP,

656
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,265
and then the access to
the cloud environment,

657
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,271
would automatically be revoked.

658
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:03,590
So there's definitely some
upside and benefits in having

659
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,620
a central identity provider
to manage your users and

660
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,790
resources across your
platforms that you're using.

661
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,590
Of course, another best
practice, very quickly is to use,

662
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,500
make sure that you're
using strong authentication

663
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,700
mechanisms, so strong and
complex passwords and also

664
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,340
multi factor authentication
to ensure that your

665
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,159
users are authenticated securely.

666
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,590
Now, typically, that would
be part of your identity

667
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,480
providers capability also.

668
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,170
So once you have a centrally
managed identity using strong

669
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,220
authentication mechanisms,
I think it's then time for

670
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,700
organizations very quickly
to start thinking about their

671
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,990
authorization model in the cloud.

672
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,010
So many organizations will
typically either consider

673
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,330
a role based access control model,

674
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,070
or an attribute based
access control model.

675
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,310
So if we talk about role
based access controls models

676
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,320
for a moment, that's when
you really define permissions

677
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,450
around the person's job function.

678
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,990
So in an all back model,
you would define the policy

679
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,380
for a particular job function
like a network administrator

680
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,510
Or for a database engineer,
and they would have specific

681
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,033
policies that allow them to
operate in the cloud environment

682
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:09,363
and access and provision resources.

683
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,570
As a best practice, you would
grant the minimum permissions

684
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,947
necessary for the job functions.

685
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,010
And of course, this is known
as granting least privilege.

686
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,783
Now, one of the kind of the
drawbacks potentially of an

687
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:22,600
RBAC model is that as you
add new resources into the

688
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,370
environment, the policies
from an RBAC perspective need

689
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,260
to get a lot more fine grained
and complicated to ensure

690
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,240
that even though I'm a
network administrator,

691
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,300
let's say as my job function,

692
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,280
is the

693
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,902
is the resources that I can interact with,

694
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,540
for at the network level,

695
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,720
actually part of my responsibility.

696
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,840
So really, that's where
attribute based access control

697
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,449
authorization strategies can help.

698
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,900
And that's where you define
permissions based on attributes

699
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,490
of the resources tied back
to the to the individual.

700
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,360
So typically, attribute
based access control policies

701
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,070
require fewer policy or fewer
policy maintenance changes.

702
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,320
But what I would say is
regardless of whether you go down

703
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,010
an ABA or ABA authorization strategy,

704
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,570
you should be aiming to
ensure that users are granted

705
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,419
only the required permissions
on the assets and resources

706
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,280
specific to their business
requirements based on the

707
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,740
principle of least privilege.

708
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,860
The next best practice I'd
like to talk about very quickly

709
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,877
is the just ensuring the
privileged accounts are not used

710
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:25,409
for day to day or BAU operations.

711
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,770
Organizations and security
teams should bear this in mind,

712
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,010
not just for the access to
the cloud providers control

713
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,629
plane, but obviously the
operating system and the,

714
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:36,410
you know, the application stacks as well.

715
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,310
A very common approach is
to make sure that you have

716
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,870
vault in these privileged
credentials in some sort of

717
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,330
identity store or privileged access vault.

718
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,600
And then when your employees
need these privileged

719
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,090
credentials, they have the
ability to de-vault them

720
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,570
potentially using an authorized
Incident Management ticket

721
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,419
or a change ticket, which
documents the, you know the actual

722
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,270
steps that they plan to take
when they move to the cloud.

723
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,090
Finally what I would say,

724
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,379
is making sure that you're obviously

725
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,460
auditing all of this access.

726
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,550
So for example, when
people are interacting with

727
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,220
the cloud resources, making
changes in your environment,

728
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,940
de-vault the privileged
credentials across your environment

729
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,190
or even using other secrets,
whether that's API keys,

730
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,750
database credentials and whatnot,

731
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,120
from an identity perspective,
making sure that you are

732
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,939
constantly logging and monitoring that.

733
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,540
And I think that comes
with the visibility.

734
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,440
You heard me mention a few
times I know the other guys

735
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,800
also agree that visibility is
one key benefit that you're

736
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,270
gonna get from the cloud environment,

737
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,900
which really empowers security
teams and CISO teams to

738
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,003
have a very proficient security posture.

739
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
- [Britta] Excellent.

740
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,310
And you can't talk identity
without talking privacy, right?

741
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,770
So final question to you
would be in and around.

742
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,850
How do CISO teams
protect PII in the cloud?

743
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,889
How do cloud providers provide
the capability to protect

744
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,223
an organization's most sensitive data?

745
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,823
- Thanks Britta.

746
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:05,630
So yeah, of course,
organizations are gonna be moving

747
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,662
critical systems sensitive
data, PII data to the cloud,

748
00:33:08,662 --> 00:33:10,580
and they're gonna want to
protect that, you know,

749
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,000
obviously from a confidentiality,

750
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,830
integrity and availability perspective,

751
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,149
but also, you know, privacy
concerns ensuring that,

752
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,170
you know, global regulations like GDPR,

753
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,030
or PDPA is around the region are kind of

754
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,770
catered for on that.

755
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,400
So Cloud providers provide
a number of layers,

756
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,190
of controls to protect sensitive data,

757
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,020
typically using a defence
in depth approach.

758
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,670
This can include things
like data classification,

759
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,360
techniques that you can
classify and you know,

760
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,473
your data to determine
what is sensitive data,

761
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:41,500
what is PII, and potentially
using simple things

762
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,520
like tagging and adding meta data,

763
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,440
but also using potentially
machine learning and

764
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,070
classification services that
allow you to automatically

765
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,450
detect where sensitive data
is inside your organization.

766
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,410
Secondly, in terms of,
you know, defence in depth

767
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,480
approach to data protection, obviously,

768
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,010
I've just talked about
access control and identity.

769
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,810
That is definitely a Key
control when we talked about

770
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,580
ensuring that only authorized
individuals in your

771
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,750
environment have access to the data,

772
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,409
the resources and the systems
that they would expect.

773
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,909
And then obviously, we have
encryption capabilities,

774
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,629
which is sometimes seen as
one of the primary controls

775
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,833
to data protection.

776
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,330
And of course, you want to
be thinking about your data

777
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,679
encryption, both in transit and at rest.

778
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,859
Okay?

779
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,984
And then finally, I think, and
I'm gonna go and touch into

780
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:27,710
a couple of these in a
little bit more detail.

781
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,810
Finally, from a data protection
perspective, and sometimes

782
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,779
I see organizations over
looking this as a control,

783
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,090
but it's what is your data backup strategy

784
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,290
to ensure that if you
do get hit with malware,

785
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,230
or ransomware, that it doesn't
have the ability to totally,

786
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,530
you know, affect the
integrity and the availability

787
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,360
of your data by you know,
encrypting it and holding you

788
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,620
ransom for Bitcoin, or for
modifying the data in a way

789
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,699
that makes it unusable.

790
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,569
So there's definitely a need

791
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,330
to think about your data backup strategy.

792
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,270
So I wanna like to dive
a little bit deeper,

793
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,880
into encryption in the cloud.

794
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,160
So customers may choose
to encrypt the data

795
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,069
for a number of reasons.

796
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,770
First of all, obviously,
initially, they want to

797
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,660
attack the sensitivity of
the business data or PII,

798
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,230
both from, you know, the
cloud provider themselves,

799
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,190
but also internally in
their own organization,

800
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,030
you know, very common attack
across enterprises around

801
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,080
the world is it an insider threat,

802
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,540
where you essentially have,
you know, an insider with,

803
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,810
you know, over overly
permissive access to a database

804
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,540
has the ability to do large
scale data exportation

805
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,020
and steal, you know,
millions of records of PII.

806
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,170
So you want to think about
controls that have multiple

807
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,133
layers when we talk about encryption.

808
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,100
In addition to just being
a really good controller

809
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,500
to protect and, you
know, implement security.

810
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,570
Also organizations have a
requirement to implement

811
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,570
encryption from regulatory perspective.

812
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,970
So again, if you're a
financial institution,

813
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,870
and your regulatory bodies
would definitely expect that

814
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,490
sensitive financial transactions
and PII is encrypted.

815
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,439
Also, if you're have any industry
certification requirements

816
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,580
like PCI-DSS are you going
through any other compliance

817
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,310
programs, you're gonna have
to demonstrate that you're

818
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,049
protecting data and of course,
from a privacy perspective.

819
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,390
So, cloud providers already
provide multiple layers of data

820
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,116
encryption, you know, as part
of the shared responsibility

821
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,900
and as part of the global network.

822
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,500
So the cloud provider may, you
know, provide the encryption

823
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,490
of the data as it moves around
the global network between,

824
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,569
you know, what the cloud
providers would call regions

825
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,150
and availability zones, and
the global infrastructure.

826
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,360
I would also provide encryption at

827
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,250
certain layers of the network stack.

828
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,780
So as the data is moving
around the you know,

829
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,320
the virtual private network
and the virtual private clouds,

830
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,460
ensuring that the data is handled

831
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,200
and encrypted in an appropriate way.

832
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,790
And also, the cloud providers
may encrypt the data

833
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,040
at the you know, a host to host
level or a virtual machine,

834
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,100
to virtual machine level,
to ensure that it's

835
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,580
encrypted at that layer.

836
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,930
Now, in addition to the
protection and the encryption

837
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,759
capabilities offered
by the cloud provider,

838
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,850
you also have the ability to
you as a customer, to add your

839
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,650
own encryption capabilities
over the top of that.

840
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,250
So typically you would have
the ability to use your cloud

841
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,640
providers native capabilities.

842
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,779
You know, all cloud providers
have the ability to use

843
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,880
hardware security modules
that will encrypt your,

844
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,470
your data at rest, where you
have the ability to potentially

845
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,569
manage the key, the lifecycle of the key,

846
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,730
the administration of the key,

847
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,620
and assign that key permission
across your organization

848
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,490
to determine who can who
can actually access your

849
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,270
access that data.

850
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,140
And in addition to
encryption of data at rest,

851
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,009
you also have the ability
then to go kind of

852
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,690
one step further and
introduce something like

853
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,110
column level encryption.

854
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,870
again, either using the
cloud providers native API's

855
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,509
that they have, or as
Mark mentioned earlier,

856
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,790
cloud providers have a
very extensive marketplace

857
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,761
of third party partners.

858
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:46,910
So if you want to use the cloud providers,

859
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,250
native encryption, and you
want just to complement

860
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,130
that potentially with a third party,

861
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,820
all you want to do kind of
column level tokenization

862
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
data masking and anonymization,

863
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,120
there's a very wide and
healthy partner ecosystem

864
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,633
that can help you.

865
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,370
So I mentioned earlier that
having a data backup strategy

866
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,549
is very important to protect
against malware or ransomware.

867
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,020
That may affect the integrity

868
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,837
but also the availability of your data.

869
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:14,002
And of course, one of the
benefits of cloud that the

870
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:18,580
team outlined earlier, is
that you do have the ability

871
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,460
to store data in very highly available,

872
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,620
highly durable locations
using the global network

873
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,400
on global regions and
global availability zones.

874
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,090
You also have the ability
to enforce, you know,

875
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,240
protection settings on your data.

876
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,540
So you can have things
like version control,

877
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,820
or write once, read many
settings or typically known as

878
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,120
WARM, which provides organizations
the ability to protect

879
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,540
kind of critical backups
against deletion for, you know,

880
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,890
time bound periods, or indefinitely
if that's what you want.

881
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,490
And this is a really good
control to protect against

882
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,160
ransomware overwriting
datasets, making it inaccessible

883
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,283
to your organization.

884
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,649
Finally, again, I want
to talk about, close the

885
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,910
data protection question,

886
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,529
is how important it is to
ensure that you as a security

887
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,270
organization, you're leveraging
the cloud native auditing

888
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,870
and logging and monitoring
solutions around this.

889
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,299
So because everything in the
cloud is essentially an API

890
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,740
call that has been logged,

891
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,100
you're going to get very
fine grained transparency

892
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,330
into your data access and
operations on that data,

893
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,230
including encryption operations,

894
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,070
decryption operations, if the
data has been moved elsewhere,

895
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,620
who the data was moved by,
who the data is frequently

896
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,259
accessed by, you know, you can
get very, very fine grained

897
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,030
logging and auditing
across your data access,

898
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,640
which the security team
gets a lot of visibility

899
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,107
and is one again, I keep
saying that visibility is an

900
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:45,993
amazing benefit on public cloud providers.

901
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,050
So thanks Britta

902
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,973
And then I guess over to Britta and Mark.

903
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,210
- [Britta] Actually, that
was a wonderful setup.

904
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,150
Mark, I wanna pull you
into the conversation now.

905
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,010
And let's talk about visibility.

906
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,950
That was a really good,

907
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,830
really good leverage point
therefore Myles thank you.

908
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,700
Mark, As a CISO, I often
hear that I cannot get enough

909
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,930
visibility into my cloud environment.

910
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,529
And I'm unsure what the
application teams are doing.

911
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,520
Is this true?

912
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,213
How do cloud providers
provide this visibility?

913
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,620
- Thanks, Britta.

914
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,520
And you're not to cut it short,

915
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,390
because Myles certainly spoke out,

916
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,939
the visibility is strong in the cloud.

917
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,460
But you know, we've had this before.

918
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,850
Yeah, it was easy on-prem,

919
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,360
you held the keys to
the change prover board.

920
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,490
You didn't open the firewall
rule to allow releases

921
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,479
to move from environment to environment,

922
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,300
to all the approvals and the security

923
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,800
reviews were completed.

924
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,760
And this is why the business
wants to move to cloud, yeah.

925
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,800
Speed, innovation, competition.

926
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,760
A lot of that comes from the developers,

927
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,317
and the application teams.

928
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,480
And for us in security.

929
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,450
The developers keep introducing new ways,

930
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,750
and new things languages we haven't run

931
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,100
or pen tested before.

932
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,423
Rust, Elixir, Kotlin.

933
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,940
New words we haven't heard.

934
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,480
Libraries, we haven't vetted for.

935
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,210
Production usage some
open source, that we may

936
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,720
haven't included before.

937
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,609
deployment packages, we're
not sure and understand how

938
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,370
to monitor like a Kubernetes containers

939
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,580
or container based workload.

940
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,860
So in part, this is true,
because we never really provided

941
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,830
this somewhere else in the business.

942
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,430
Where we could quickly and
elastically deliver services.

943
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,169
But the cloud is told by default,

944
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,010
to provide the security and visibility,

945
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,203
in a way you didn't
have on-premises model.

946
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,980
Such things as default
identity and access management.

947
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,590
You have logs of all admin activities

948
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,130
and the service accounts and
the communications by default.

949
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,340
Strong identity and access
management can limit application

950
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,810
teams to only do what
they should be doing.

951
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,560
And org policy with a
hierarchical firewall rule.

952
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,590
Protecting the infrastructure,
should not have the

953
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,250
permissions at the application team

954
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,230
to be overridden for
their individual project.

955
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,170
One example of the strong
control that you can have

956
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,743
and management.

957
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,860
Another area would be data storage,

958
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,640
spoken about that with the
PII classification with Abbas

959
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,960
and through what Myles have spoken about.

960
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,570
It's centrally managed,
can be scanned for PII

961
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,720
and sensitive business data.

962
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,700
And the usage and monitoring
of that is all tracked

963
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,872
and logged with data.

964
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,060
Infrastructure logs, creation
of subnets, IP addresses,

965
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,803
VPC's all exist by default.

966
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:30,450
And networks can easily have
flow analysis or full packet

967
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,120
capture enabled to allow
you to do deeper analysis

968
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,350
of changes in the environment,
or what application teams

969
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,350
are doing and using in
that space themselves.

970
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,830
without the need for specialized hardware,

971
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,950
traditional span ports and
challenges that are associated

972
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,573
with NetFlow devices.

973
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,600
And service accounts.

974
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,910
One of the major bands of
existence that we've had

975
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,207
traditionally in security,

976
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:58,580
are hugely monitorable
in a cloud environment.

977
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Revocable, understandable,
highly auditable and there's

978
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,850
also a mention of managing
the keys and vaulting.

979
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,630
And IAAM around that.

980
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,340
This is also very powerful
capability, to understand how

981
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,980
your system to system
interactions are occurring,

982
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,680
and monitoring those
application teams norms of

983
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,792
communications with their
systems and services.

984
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,140
And last, but certainly not least,

985
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,890
is there's a bunch of native
compliance and benchmark

986
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,560
analysis that can be built
in, to give you some industry

987
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,630
best practices, that
Myles mentioned earlier.

988
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,420
So Cloud can actually give
you some native analysis

989
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,250
of whether you're meeting
some industry standards

990
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,170
like a CIS benchmark analysis as well.

991
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,740
So these are certain areas
that great visibility

992
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,899
can be added to the environment.

993
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,820
It exists natively in cloud,

994
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,180
and it's a matter of
applying it to a new way

995
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,529
inside the way you operate.

996
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,393
Thanks, Britta.

997
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,610
- Thanks, Mark.

998
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,830
So going back to actually
the very beginning,

999
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,520
The introduction when you
talked about automation,

1000
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,720
let's dig a little further there.

1001
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
Why is automation so important

1002
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,757
from a security perspective in the cloud?

1003
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:09,450
And how can it be used to
increase an organization's

1004
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,180
stability to effectively
respond to incidents

1005
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,403
faster than on-prem?

1006
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,080
- Sure.

1007
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,860
Yeah, It's a common challenge that we have

1008
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,470
and you know constant thing
the cloud is we're moving

1009
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,169
faster, which means change is faster.

1010
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,720
And the traditional analogy
of a car that goes fast

1011
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,359
and needs bigger brakes, it
really isn't just that simple.

1012
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,930
You just can't put bigger brakes on it,

1013
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,910
it doesn't work like
that, you're actually not

1014
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,180
actually creating the outcome you want,

1015
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,029
which is to go faster with more safety.

1016
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,640
So I'm gonna consider building
security controls in the

1017
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,962
cloud to be more like the
anti-lock braking system on a car.

1018
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,790
It helps when you make a mistake,

1019
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,790
it can lessen or even
possibly prevent the crash

1020
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,440
from occurring, but it's
able to detect something

1021
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,403
that's gone wrong in the
situation and act on that.

1022
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,410
This type of intervention
is only possible,

1023
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,560
through automation.

1024
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,120
It's too late to retrain the driver,

1025
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,230
and they're out of control in production.

1026
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,930
How do we detect, immediately
identify and start

1027
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,470
to work on remediation in that space?

1028
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,930
Automation is key, and it
must be built in from the

1029
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,870
beginning so that you're
equipped with those tools.

1030
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,770
When the developers go
out building applications,

1031
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,203
and leveraging the elastic
services that cloud provides.

1032
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,100
The DevOps concept as a guard
rails, not gates concept.

1033
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,630
You can't scale to your
security team to meet the many

1034
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,880
different inspection points
that you traditionally

1035
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,510
had with a UIT to staging or
staging to production release

1036
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,510
cycle with those change approval
boards I mentioned earlier.

1037
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,460
- Developers now experiment in production.

1038
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,390
Release in production with
blue, green, and A, B, and

1039
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,710
Canary testing methodologies,
how do you enable that safely?

1040
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,680
and manage that, automation
is gonna be key to detect any

1041
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,629
anomalous spikes, any
particular challenges,

1042
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,340
and responding to that,

1043
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,840
while you're actually doing
testing in production?

1044
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,200
So where do you start?

1045
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,770
Well, actually, it starts
with the power of cloud,

1046
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,370
the asset inventory.

1047
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,810
Everything in cloud is a digital asset,

1048
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,440
a firewall rule, an IP
address, monitoring assets,

1049
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,580
resources and policies in the cloud,

1050
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,420
we can actually build that
anti-lock braking system.

1051
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,640
These are norms that are simply incorrect

1052
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,069
for an environment.

1053
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,270
Let's go for an example.

1054
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,509
Creating a virtual machine.

1055
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,530
You can first test if it came from the

1056
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,043
sowey or trusted image store.

1057
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,330
Is it approved?

1058
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,200
doesn't have a public IP address.

1059
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,350
Has it been scanned for
the latest vulnerabilities?

1060
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,089
Does it need this public IP address,

1061
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,070
if it does, is it exposed
behind the load balancer,

1062
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,870
the web application firewall
and is it accordingly only

1063
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,790
able to be communicated from the

1064
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,120
back end IP addresses at that.

1065
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,580
This is a very simple litmus test,

1066
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,833
to create a mitigation
control for a web application.

1067
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,370
And if it was had a firewall
rule of any any to the

1068
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,700
internet, we immediately
have a problem and

1069
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,089
an anti-lock braking system can kick in

1070
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,970
and start to mitigate
that particular risk.

1071
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,169
Now, let's talk about some data.

1072
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,530
PII is something that we
are furiously protecting

1073
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,180
and making sure we monitor and
manage in every environment

1074
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,653
to protect our customers.

1075
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,580
When you upload data to the cloud,

1076
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,540
you can go through a quarantine,

1077
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,270
you can only allow to
be uploaded in one place

1078
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,900
that checks whether or not
that is the right place,

1079
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,970
right information for the right use case.

1080
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,732
Should PII be in a public store?

1081
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,660
Of course not.

1082
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,600
And so therefore, every time
you add information to a store,

1083
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,410
you can check with this PII.

1084
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,359
And you can check the permissions
if they're public or not.

1085
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,870
And this can create that, again,

1086
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,680
anti lock braking mechanism.

1087
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,890
that continual monitoring
that continual alert,

1088
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,569
that will allow you to allow
them to upload much data

1089
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,260
as they need to do their job,

1090
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,543
but create safety nets and
controls not to mitigate risk.

1091
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:15,350
So in the that two fairly
strong examples of how

1092
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,819
only automation could
really solve the problem,

1093
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,446
because the scale at which
we build infrastructure,

1094
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:23,500
and the scale at which we move data today,

1095
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,163
no human can watch any of that.

1096
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,180
Back to you Britta.

1097
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,083
- Excellent.

1098
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,270
And a final question for
you mark in this segment.

1099
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,500
And then we'll bring all our guests

1100
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,977
back for a parting question.

1101
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:38,600
"How can the cloud help
me implement security at

1102
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,150
every stage of the software
development lifecycle?"

1103
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,620
- Yeah, this is a really,
really big question.

1104
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,640
And there's lots of approaches
and different names.

1105
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,009
Some call it shifting left on security,

1106
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,830
bringing security early into the STLC,

1107
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,580
the software development
that upset lifecycle.

1108
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,900
DevOps, as I've mentioned just prior.

1109
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,770
Making everyone accountable
across both development

1110
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,860
and operations for
security being built in,

1111
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,970
or building cloud native,

1112
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,859
moving from a traditional model,

1113
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,330
to a cloud native security model.

1114
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,009
What are you gonna need to do?

1115
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,003
Well, as a seesaw, probably
a little bit of everything.

1116
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,240
That's strategically moving to
an improved security quality,

1117
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,799
no matter what you do.

1118
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,360
And building an environment,

1119
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,450
that will migrate most of
your services to in the future

1120
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,930
that supports these principles.

1121
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,620
Which is likely to be cloud-native

1122
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,460
So how important is it to do this?

1123
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,300
So one of the state of
DevOps reports or DO reports,

1124
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,320
it was found that high
performing organizations,

1125
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,240
were doing 50% less time,
remediating security,

1126
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,033
than low performing organization,
when they got this wrap.

1127
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,220
So it's extremely important,
in that resource optimization

1128
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,279
and in the ability to
improve the security posture

1129
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,063
of your applications and
the systems that you run.

1130
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,860
So shifting left in
security review process,

1131
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,620
too early in the system
development lifecycle,

1132
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,520
requires several changes,

1133
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,620
but not all of these are
significant deviations

1134
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,480
from the norm.

1135
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,160
You should get information
infosec and vault

1136
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,623
early in the software design.

1137
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,830
The infosec team should get
involved in design phase

1138
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,380
for all projects.

1139
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,810
When it begins a review can
be added as a guiding factor

1140
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,210
for releasing the design
to a development stage.

1141
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,440
You can develop security approve tools,

1142
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,570
providing datas with
pre-approved libraries

1143
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,770
and you know code packages that have input

1144
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:50,640
and pre determined approval
from the security team

1145
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,799
to standardize develop a code.

1146
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,360
This makes it easier to
review the differences

1147
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,573
instead of the core which
you know can be reusable.

1148
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,049
You can develop automated testing,

1149
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,930
the cloud's really good with this.

1150
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,299
Using that asset management
database I spoke about earlier.

1151
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,560
Changes in the environment can trigger,

1152
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,170
scanning and code reviews

1153
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,550
Building security tests into
that code can be continuously

1154
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,800
tested scale without
requiring manual review,

1155
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,510
and identify common
security vulnerabilities,

1156
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:26,890
earlier on in the
lifecycle for mitigation.

1157
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,440
So how does cloud really help?

1158
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,880
This is web platform as a service.

1159
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,563
And containers really show the strength.

1160
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,800
Cloud brings the same power,
to development teams and the

1161
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,050
security team with these services.

1162
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,330
One great example is something
called, the service mesh,

1163
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,933
or like open source products such as STR.

1164
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,980
Imagine you can secure
every call to every service

1165
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,790
with mutual authentication
and limit these communications

1166
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,950
only to the right services,
they're approved to talk to

1167
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,919
the other services without
changing the application.

1168
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,160
That sounds like a
fantastic security tool,

1169
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,920
you can apply across your
container based services

1170
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,210
to get telemetry, observability,
apply security in transit,

1171
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,930
and understand the norm of communications,

1172
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,660
to give an understanding
of what is talking to what,

1173
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,299
when is it allowed to?

1174
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,300
And is there anything abnormal
happening in the environment?

1175
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,860
This is not just about
the operational security,

1176
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,100
it's also about the supply chain.

1177
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,049
So by protecting interaction
to containers is only one part.

1178
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,640
The next is making sure
your images are trustworthy.

1179
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,866
So how do we do that?

1180
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,430
We must make sure the supply chain,

1181
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,343
has security and compliance
pegged in from the beginning.

1182
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,919
We do two main things here.

1183
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,170
One we're very familiar
with, vulnerability scanning,

1184
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,170
container vulnerability scanning.

1185
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,780
Lets you quickly understand
potential threats and

1186
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,520
identify issues as your
containers are built and stored

1187
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,790
through the container lifecycle.

1188
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,850
The infosec team is a critical
tenant in managing that

1189
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,270
container image and the vulnerabilities

1190
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,663
and packages that exist.

1191
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,350
And the ability to remediate,

1192
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,080
and secondary monitoring
binaries executing

1193
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,190
with binary authorization.

1194
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,630
Open Source capabilities
exist for this to provide

1195
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,600
the services you can use in the cloud,

1196
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,009
to to provide this level of capability,

1197
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,090
in the supply chain and
operational observability.

1198
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,130
So, I think that one's
addressed the question

1199
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,420
and back to you, Britta.

1200
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,570
- Excellent.

1201
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:39,570
I'm wanna bring all of our
panelists back now into the room.

1202
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,160
We've been drinking from a firehose,

1203
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,160
this there's been a lot
of really good material

1204
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,399
given between all of our
all of our presenters.

1205
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,910
I'd like you to address
this last question.

1206
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,970
Myles if you can start
and then Abbas then Mark,

1207
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,817
you'll have the final words.

1208
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:58,140
"What are three key next
steps for a CISO organization

1209
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,779
to consider when moving to the cloud?

1210
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,613
Myles.

1211
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,940
- [Myles] Thanks Britta.

1212
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,760
So the the first one for me,

1213
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,450
and I don't think it was
addressed actually through

1214
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,210
the previous slides,
but how important it is

1215
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:14,450
for a CISOs organization
to establish a training

1216
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,359
enablement and certification program

1217
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,093
for public cloud security.

1218
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:20,790
And one of the reasons
for that I find is that

1219
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,529
most organization, the
cloud journey is obviously

1220
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,870
driven by a business demand.

1221
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,400
And then, you know, a business requirement

1222
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,330
to move to the cloud for whatever benefits

1223
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,830
that they're trying to drive.

1224
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,960
And typically, there will be
some sort of cloud working

1225
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,730
group or cloud center of Excellence,

1226
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,210
which is largely an engineering team

1227
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,193
or an application team driving that.

1228
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,960
Unfortunately, sometimes the
security team is maybe not

1229
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,890
initially part of that
cloud working group,

1230
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,279
or that kind of cloud
center of excellence.

1231
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,560
And maybe the security
organization hasn't had time

1232
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,370
to fully adapt their,
you know, existing tools,

1233
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,910
capabilities and processes
and even thinking around

1234
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,359
security for the cloud.

1235
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,920
So I think as CISO it's very
important to ensure that

1236
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,970
you have a line of sight on
skilling up and you know,

1237
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,620
rescaling the team on the new aspects

1238
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,970
of security in the cloud.

1239
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,939
Now, yes, there is gonna
be existing tooling

1240
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,990
and existing control
objectives and principles

1241
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,490
that you're gonna bring with you.

1242
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,720
But as you've heard from
all three presenters today,

1243
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,480
there are slightly different
ways of thinking about that.

1244
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,610
So my first consideration
for a CISO team is to look

1245
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,650
inwards at your own organization,

1246
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,080
and evaluate what actual
capability you have

1247
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,940
around public cloud security,

1248
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,170
it's gonna be very difficult
to do the rest of your job

1249
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,730
functions, whether that's
architecture reviews,

1250
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,160
engineering, security operations,

1251
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,661
if your own organization really
doesn't fully understand,

1252
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:42,250
you know, the public
cloud security principles,

1253
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,640
and also what the objectives
are of the business teams

1254
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,859
that are moving to cloud.

1255
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,040
So for example, if your
organization's ambition this year

1256
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,370
is to migrate everything
to a cloud provider

1257
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,740
and do kind of all in and
close the data centers,

1258
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,500
your security capability
and enablement plan.

1259
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,700
will look very different to
an organization that's just

1260
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,439
trying to get started with PLCs and

1261
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,150
maybe non critical data and systems.

1262
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,250
So I think the first one
is to is to establish

1263
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,850
a training and enable
but similarly on that,

1264
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,440
sticking on that suggestion for a moment,

1265
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,350
I would also look inwards
and have a look at,

1266
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,549
who within your organization
is the single threaded

1267
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,210
leader for cloud security.

1268
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,430
So if it's kind of a little bit of a

1269
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,290
hobby of everybody's
job, that's, you know,

1270
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,590
maybe okay for now, but what
I do see with organization

1271
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,600
that where cloud security
is a second class citizen

1272
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,350
or it's not someone's full time job,

1273
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,279
then there's no real
ownership over driving some

1274
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,020
of these strategic programs
that you're gonna need.

1275
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,800
The second consideration that I would say,

1276
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,300
is that organization as I mentioned,

1277
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,450
kind of in length in one of
my in one of my questions

1278
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,879
was around how important it is to

1279
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,300
build a control framework for cloud.

1280
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,240
So for example, if an
application team kind of

1281
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,120
puts their hand up and says,

1282
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,210
We wanna move to cloud,

1283
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,280
security team, what do we need to do?

1284
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,820
I think there needs to be
a very clear defined set of

1285
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,660
obligations and, you know,

1286
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,460
control objectives that need to be built.

1287
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,120
I do see a lot of customers
spending a lot of cycles

1288
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,350
and when the security
team kind of, you know,

1289
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,880
being really challenged when
there's no real clear path

1290
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,930
forward, or clear set of requirements

1291
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,509
for the application teams.

1292
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,460
Now in most organization,
the application teams

1293
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,640
are very willing to build
those control requirements

1294
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,680
into their application technology stack,

1295
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,910
but they need to be defined
first and really kind of,

1296
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,663
you know, confirmed
with the security team.

1297
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,700
Then I think a CISO should
also take that a step further.

1298
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,660
So a really good place to
start is to have a well defined

1299
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,910
control framework that all
of the application teams

1300
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,970
across your organization are aware of.

1301
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,899
It's been communicated,
it's been agreed upon.

1302
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,830
But in addition to that, as I mentioned,

1303
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,020
the actual control implementation
or the control procedures

1304
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,580
that are specific to the cloud,

1305
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,930
I think successful security
teams actually go that

1306
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,560
extra mile and work kind
of hand in glove with the

1307
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,140
engineering teams to come up
with solutions to actually

1308
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,460
ensure that those controls
objectives are embedded into

1309
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,750
the applications development lifecycle.

1310
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,123
Mark talked about shifting security left,

1311
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:07,580
and you know, DevOps
principles around that.

1312
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,900
Now, I think, you know, the
security team can really

1313
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,200
lean into the engineering
and cloud working groups

1314
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,430
that are providing subject
matter expertise as to how

1315
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:19,370
those control objectives
really can be built into,

1316
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,109
into the pipeline to
ensure that those controls

1317
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,280
are constantly audited or prevented

1318
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,230
or detected in real time.

1319
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,130
Then the final consideration
of the three that I would say

1320
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,660
is that organization and
particularly security teams,

1321
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,410
really need to embrace the
visibility and automation

1322
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,839
benefits that you get in.

1323
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,410
If you don't have real time
visibility into your control

1324
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:44,359
framework, or if you don't
have a real time security

1325
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,330
operation set up where you're
have immediate notification

1326
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,049
when, you know, a high
risk event is occurring

1327
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,240
in your organization, then
I think there's a little bit

1328
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,649
of work to do for you as a security team.

1329
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,340
As I mentioned many times
the visibility that you get

1330
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,780
not Just from the, you know,
the native control plane,

1331
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,980
but across all of the logging
and monitoring solutions

1332
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,530
available to you in the cloud,
really does allow you to

1333
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,360
build this kind of fully
automated real time responsive

1334
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,420
Security Operations center.

1335
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,630
In addition to that, not
just detecting these alerts

1336
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,820
in real time, but also
firing automatic responses to

1337
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,430
essentially self heal or self remediate,

1338
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,750
these incidents as they occur

1339
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,870
is a very powerful position to be in.

1340
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,790
So just to recap;

1341
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,192
Training, Enable your
teams be prescriptive

1342
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,150
of your guidance,

1343
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,579
Automate as much as possible.

1344
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:28,674
Thanks Britta.

1345
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:31,007
- [Britta] Excellent, Abbas.

1346
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:33,560
- [Abbas] Thank you Myles
and thank you Britta.

1347
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,350
So being a cybersecurity
practitioner and being a CISO,

1348
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,819
I always like to think from a

1349
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,720
risk management lens point of view.

1350
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,439
Yes, controls are required,
but they are secondary for me.

1351
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,870
So as CISO, now that
decision has been made

1352
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:50,049
that now we need to move towards cloud.

1353
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,530
So what is my risk management focus now.

1354
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,590
I have to focus my,

1355
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,850
I need to shift my focus to three areas.

1356
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:03,220
First, being identity, second
being information protection.

1357
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,140
And third is my device management.

1358
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,240
So my cloud security strategy,
which I'm building now,

1359
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,459
from one frame to the cloud,

1360
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,250
my entire strategy or from
risk management point of view

1361
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,650
will be running around these
three legs, as I call it.

1362
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,483
Right?

1363
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:20,640
In terms of identity, identity
becomes my new perimeter.

1364
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,490
So how I'm going to focus
on management identity

1365
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,287
with multi factor authentication
in terms of strong

1366
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:27,810
authentication, or even going towards

1367
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,890
a passwordless journey, right?

1368
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,150
And how I'm going to manage the

1369
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,710
least privilege access management role.

1370
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,030
When it comes to Information Protection,

1371
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,070
now that I have my data shifting from

1372
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,363
my on-prem to the cloud,

1373
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,930
how do I manage my information,

1374
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,819
in terms of sensitivity, criticality,

1375
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,330
we talk about the backup,
we talk about encryption,

1376
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,119
who has access to what?

1377
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,010
Where are where am I storing those data?

1378
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,370
the geographical location, the tenancy,

1379
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,000
the jurisdiction within which
country am I hosting those

1380
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,240
data, all those things have
to come up as a apart strategy

1381
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,330
I need to have a information
protection strategy,

1382
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,319
apart from my identity strategy.

1383
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,130
The third being device which
is on the threat management.

1384
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,230
Now that my employees
are working from home,

1385
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,240
working from remotely
taking advantage of cloud,

1386
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,500
as an opportunity for especially
in this Pandemic situation,

1387
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,140
what controls do I need to think of,

1388
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,830
or what strategy do I need to think of,

1389
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,363
of managing those device?

1390
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:24,590
Or am I going to allow my employee to use,

1391
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,330
or bring your own device?

1392
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,520
Or am I going to allow,

1393
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,080
how do I manage the handheld device?

1394
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,560
What kind of threat protection
do I need to put on them?

1395
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,810
So my strategy will shift
from focusing highly

1396
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,000
on network centric, which is internal,

1397
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,747
to a more cloud centric in
defining in this three area.

1398
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:45,730
Identity, Information
protection and device.

1399
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,370
The second second point is;

1400
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,029
I keep on talking about
identity and we have

1401
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,460
spoken enough about that.

1402
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,130
Identity is a new perimeter, right?

1403
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,950
I can no longer focus on
having everything behind

1404
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,779
the firewall on Network centric.

1405
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,400
So now I need to start thinking
from a zero trust network

1406
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,070
to architecture point of view.

1407
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,130
Zero trust, as I say,
it's not a technology,

1408
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,320
it's a strategy and it's a journey.

1409
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,277
So from zero trust point of view,

1410
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:10,930
I need to focus on my
core three principles,

1411
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,310
which is a trust no one
and verify everyone.

1412
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,890
So the healthy signals
which I am collecting

1413
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,879
from my identity and my
and my device management,

1414
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,430
I need to verify each
and every signals because

1415
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:25,759
that's how I'm going to
get an assurance whether

1416
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,049
the person or the device
which is trying to access my

1417
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:34,870
resources is the right and
healthy in terms of the signals

1418
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:38,074
are good, the device is managed,

1419
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:39,820
already meeting my compliance requirement,

1420
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,460
the identity which they are
using are not been compromised,

1421
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,280
and the identity which are
being used are with the correct

1422
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,780
security features on them.

1423
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:51,020
So trust no one, verify, everyone.

1424
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,590
The second one, my
principle which I will go

1425
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,663
and focus on my identity is my,

1426
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,029
I call it a least privilege, right?

1427
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,610
That's another the part of my strategy,

1428
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,870
as I talked about in the first option,

1429
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:06,230
least privilege talks about
not giving a standing access

1430
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,533
to anyone in perspective of what role

1431
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:10,960
they have even the admin,
they should have something

1432
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,530
like just in time, and
just enough access isn't

1433
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,791
based on the need,

1434
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,260
or we call it a role based access control.

1435
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,093
Right?

1436
01:03:18,093 --> 01:03:20,009
So that's what I need to
focus on when I'm building up

1437
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,310
my identity based perimeter.

1438
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,770
And the third principle
which are following my second

1439
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,400
recommendation is having the,

1440
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,820
assume breach mindset, right?

1441
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,680
I have to have a defensive Layer in my,

1442
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,410
in my control framework,
as Myles was talking about.

1443
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,990
So in case my first control is breached,

1444
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,640
what do I have as second
control to protect my data

1445
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,150
from getting exfiltrated.

1446
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,530
So I need to constantly work from

1447
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,105
an assumed breach scenario.

1448
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:51,940
Those are my top three, within
my second recommendation.

1449
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,010
And the third key takeaway
for CISO was trying to move

1450
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,630
towards cloud and we had a meeting had

1451
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,420
a lot of discussion on shared model.

1452
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,323
So I want to reiterate that
particular thought steps that

1453
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:07,089
understand the shared
responsibility and the shared model.

1454
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,983
Implement a good governance, usually,

1455
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,780
the things I would go one level up

1456
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,250
in terms of roles and responsibility.

1457
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,610
So as a CISO, I had a team
who was managing the network

1458
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,960
security, the access control and whatnot.

1459
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,730
But when things go on cloud,
there are a number of tools

1460
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:28,318
and security features which
are provided by your cloud

1461
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:29,151
service provider.

1462
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:31,410
Now, there's always tug
of war between the team.

1463
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,009
That which teams should have access

1464
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,173
to which security tool
brought in by my CSP.

1465
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,899
Is it the network security team?

1466
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,210
Is it the IT security?

1467
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,580
Is in the information security?

1468
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,549
Is it my softie.

1469
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,880
So have a clear definition as the CISO

1470
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,967
that now that we are we
are moving things on cloud

1471
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,860
and now we have the cloud based
security tools and control,

1472
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:54,090
which team is focused on risk
for visibility point of view,

1473
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,960
which team is going to focus
on managing and reviewing

1474
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,640
and monitoring those particular dashboard?

1475
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,819
So, having a clear line of
responsibility will go a long way

1476
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,920
for CISO rather than going back and forth.

1477
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,800
Right?

1478
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,973
And also understand,

1479
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,522
the shift in the role,

1480
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,140
shift in the role for the
security that they are no longer

1481
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,950
doing things manually,
there is a heavy reliance on

1482
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,220
automations and artificial intelligence

1483
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,120
and MLS and whatnot over the cloud.

1484
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,830
And the shift also is
focused of initially,

1485
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:31,259
the net of security was focusing
more on being an author,

1486
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,930
but now they are shifting their focus

1487
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:36,218
to being more of a governance
role they're taking.

1488
01:05:36,218 --> 01:05:38,549
And as our Mark talking about

1489
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,240
the software development
life cycles in AGPT.

1490
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,830
So that's also comes into
your governance models

1491
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,569
that how your architecture
teams are continuously

1492
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:50,180
being involved, the security
is been embedded right

1493
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,720
from the beginning or from
the design point of view,

1494
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,890
right with the design judgment
discussion to all the way

1495
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,569
from the testing point
of view, at every stage.

1496
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,860
So, three recommendation;

1497
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,255
Understand the risk management,

1498
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:04,640
have a risk management lens
controlled as the secondary,

1499
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,629
Focusing on identity based
perimeter, which is a zero trust.

1500
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,710
Trust no one verify everyone.

1501
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,515
Least privilege and assume breach,

1502
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:13,600
and third is a shared model,

1503
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,339
and good governance should be in place

1504
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,250
whenever you're moving on the cloud.

1505
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,253
Over to you, Mark.

1506
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,350
- [Mark] Thanks very much Abbas.

1507
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,010
I think of this like moving house.

1508
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,420
We don't do it often and when you do it,

1509
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,940
you really want it to be right.

1510
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,610
Rarely do such fundamental
shifts in technology,

1511
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:39,180
that change the IT landscape come around.

1512
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,169
centralized computing with a mainframe.

1513
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,380
Decentralize with clients server.

1514
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,160
Virtualization making efficiency
out of Central resources

1515
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,200
and now containerized micro services

1516
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,740
and edge computing extending this,

1517
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,493
each improving the
efficiency of the product.

1518
01:06:57,412 --> 01:06:59,359
Direct constance in this for security,

1519
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,860
safe storage of data,

1520
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,570
secure communications,

1521
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,080
Identity and Access,

1522
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,460
operating systems and binaries.

1523
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,240
These haven't changed.

1524
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,839
With each evolution, we
seen more abstraction,

1525
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,203
the underlying complexity and
higher automation throughout.

1526
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,803
The common aspects being speed, and code.

1527
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,750
Cloud is an overlay on this.

1528
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,500
Use it to augment your business needs.

1529
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,300
This could be bare metal for now,

1530
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,982
or going completely serverless

1531
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:29,867
on the other end of the scale.

1532
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:34,283
Either way, get your
teams closer to the code.

1533
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,973
Embrace extreme automation.

1534
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:41,549
Own code and systems that
developers should never touch,

1535
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,310
like the standard operating environment,

1536
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:47,440
of a VM or a container image
or cryptography libraries

1537
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,803
that only security experts
should really be understanding.

1538
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,610
Abbas spoke about zero trust.

1539
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:57,139
I think this is very important
when it comes to cloud.

1540
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,340
Wholly access and manage
those credentials now that

1541
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,500
identities the real perimeter,

1542
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,780
wherever you're accessing from.

1543
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,580
For me, two factor
authentication is mandatory here.

1544
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:10,920
It's now cheap, scalable
and easily appliable to your

1545
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,733
organization, pleased do it.

1546
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:19,620
And CIS benchmarks is a
nice starting ground for

1547
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,880
understanding the security
posture for what really is

1548
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,773
gonna be a multi cloud world.

1549
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,210
Of just like each database
is different in the way it

1550
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,340
operates each cloud provider can be also.

1551
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,220
Do the education study and
research to successfully

1552
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,990
mark controls?

1553
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:39,069
I would say the CIS benchmarks
is a nice opening door

1554
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:41,540
and tailored it to your particular needs.

1555
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,962
It's there for most major
cloud providers today.

1556
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,452
That's it from me.

1557
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:47,286
Back to you Britta.

1558
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,269
- [Britta] Excellent.

1559
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:54,010
Well, attendees, you just
got a wealth of information.

1560
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,510
I hope you were taking good notes.

1561
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:58,729
I hope you were chatting
away with our panelists.

1562
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:01,663
Very smart leaders in their field.

1563
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:03,759
Their contact information is here.

1564
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,439
Feel free to engage with them.

1565
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,290
We thank you for joining us today.

1566
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,040
And panelists. thank you very much.
