14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,523
for the presentation.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,140
- Hello everyone.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,030
Today I'm very happy to have
the opportunities to discuss

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,925
how Geopolitical
Intelligence can help you in

18
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,723
cyberdefense operation.

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,259
First of all let's look at an event

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,380
that happened on May 12 2019.

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,380
On May 12, 2019, the government
of the UAE announced that

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,930
four commercial oil industry vessel

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,930
registered in Saudi
Arabia, the UAE and Norway

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,003
were subject to a sabotage
attack off the coast of the UAE.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,180
Suspicion immediately following Iran,

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,150
but Iranian authorities
prompted denounced the attack

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,040
and the call for an investigation.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,990
News report about the attack
speculated who was behind it,

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,089
isn't a state actor?

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,490
Is it Iran and why did this happen?

31
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,960
It is because in the words
of one of the headlines

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,960
you see here, Failed
US-Iran Diplomacy Sets Stage

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,743
for New Spike in Tentions.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,980
Let's imagine a soft hash attack like that

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,160
happened to your organization,
what would you do?

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,650
The CEO would likely

37
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,520
ask the Chief Information
Security Officer,

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,970
shall we worry about this?

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,900
What should we worry about?

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,800
The CISO would ask the Security
Operations Center manager,

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,830
what are you seeing?

42
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,620
Did you see any instance in our network?

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,180
The SOC manager would ask the analyst,

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,910
what are you looking
for, of normal activities

45
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,930
or any tactics, techniques,

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,843
procedures from familiar thread groups?

47
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,390
So where shall we look for
answers for this questions

48
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,940
asking down from CEO to analysts.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,780
In today's talk, I would like to discuss

50
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,270
how Geopolitical Intelligence
helps to answer questions

51
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,020
like this from various
levels of decision making

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,020
in an organization helps you
mitigate a cyber security risk.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,170
Geopolitical Intelligence is analysis

54
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,170
of International political,
military, business, social,

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,180
cultural contact and then
under the understanding

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,123
of a threat environment.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,826
Geopolitical Intelligence helps to answer

58
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:46,799
what happened based on
facts, not speculation.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,420
Who are the players
involved, a state actor,

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,269
a commercial competitor
or a cyber criminals?

61
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,480
What are their motives?

62
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,890
What does he do what they do?

63
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,750
What are they going to do
next and when are they likely

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,680
to make the move?

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,370
Lastly, how is going
to affect your business

66
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,603
and in what way?

67
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,659
First, let's dive into how operationalized

68
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,627
Geopolitical Intelligence
to reinforce cyberdefense.

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Geopolitical Intelligence
that I discuss today

70
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,530
is under the umbrella of
cyber threat intelligence.

71
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,409
So what is cyber threat intelligence?

72
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,713
Here I have a very short definition.

73
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,109
Cyber threat intelligence
is simply information about

74
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,870
threats and threat actor
that provides sufficient

75
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,020
understanding for
mitigating a harmful event

76
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,222
in the cyber domain.

77
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,120
In the definition, a threat
is someone or something that

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,200
exploits a vulnerability in a target.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,950
The vulnerability such as a
software bug, a weak password

80
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,200
is not a threat itself.

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,260
The threat is whoever who takes advantage

82
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,423
of that vulnerability.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,783
Then we come to a threat actors.

84
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,210
Information about threat
actors and their motivations,

85
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,870
intentions and measures
are also a key component

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,520
of cyber threat intelligence.

87
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,032
Because this is the information

88
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:31,380
will help to reach the
ultimate goal of mitigating

89
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,060
harmful events in the cyber domain

90
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,763
and protecting the critical
asset of the organization.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,729
One popular model that originated
in the military consider

92
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,363
cyberdefense with three aspects,

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,400
strategic, operational and a tactical.

94
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,400
This threat level would
be better represented

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,453
with a triangle or circle because
these are not her article.

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,962
At the strategic level,
cyberdefense focus on developing

97
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:12,962
ideas and infrastructure to
achieve leadership objective,

98
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,919
such as a company's cyberdefense
and business vision,

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,863
policies, strategies and investment.

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,770
Back to the sabotage attack scenario,

101
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,640
the CEO would be asking,
what should we worry about

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,373
because the CEO is responsible
for the entire company.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,349
The operational level is
centered around planning

104
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,720
and executing strategies and operations

105
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,980
and deciding how to deploy resources.

106
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,500
For example, designing
and managing defense team

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,439
organizational structure,
standard operating procedures,

108
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,540
and the practicing instant response drills

109
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,400
in the sub dash attack scenario above.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,429
The CISO trying to
understand a pattern of event

111
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,883
would represent the operational level.

112
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,580
The tactical level of
cyberdefense is built around

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,950
a planning, executing
tasks and engagements.

114
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,770
In cyberdefense, it includes
crafting, threat hunting,

115
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,840
signature and intrusion
detection system alerts,

116
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,330
blocking malicious traffic,
and instant response

117
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,370
and event analysis.

118
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,350
The SOC analysts mentioned
in the scenario above

119
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,363
would represent the technical level.

120
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,919
After understanding the
main goals of three levels

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,660
of cyberdefense, let's look at

122
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,103
how cyber threat intelligence
drives cyberdefense.

123
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,370
At a strategical level,
cyber threat intelligence

124
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,490
provides understanding of
the identity, motivations,

125
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,460
intentions, capabilities,
constraints, limitations

126
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,460
and the locations of threat
actors and the sponsors.

127
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,960
At the operational level, cyber
threat intelligence defines

128
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,099
how much and what data
together for example,

129
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,500
any significant calendar days
we need to watch closely,

130
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,903
and what threat actor TTPs are actionable.

131
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,520
At the technical level,
cyber threat intelligence

132
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,370
focus on adversary TTPs,
indicators of compromise such as

133
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,370
malicious IP addresses, domains,
file, hashes, and so on.

134
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,039
In terms of the role of
Geopolitical Intelligence,

135
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,310
it informs cyber threat intelligence.

136
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,209
Geopolitical Intelligence can
be applied at the strategic,

137
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,023
operational and the
technical level as well.

138
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,479
As the strategic level,
executives benefit from

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,250
Geopolitical Intelligence
as they consider doing

140
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,770
a business deal or setting up operations

141
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,170
in a particular country,
or as they reorganize

142
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,370
in the changing business
environment as they decide

143
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,093
how much to spend on cyberdefense
and other priorities.

144
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,270
A geopolitical point of view
inspires information sharing

145
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,000
within your organization
to connect the dots

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,670
between seemingly separate
incidents that may be caught

147
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,550
by different teams for
our brand protection

148
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,030
and other secure teams, but
which might be carried out

149
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,122
by a state actor.

150
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,340
At the operational level
CISOs, risk managers

151
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,980
and other analysts and planners,

152
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,970
in organizations with mature
cyberdefense practice,

153
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,980
use Geopolitical Intelligence
to calibrate threat models,

154
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,630
asses the balance between
parameter protections

155
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,260
and the proactive detection and response

156
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,569
to vet service providers and
vendors and develop practice

157
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:10,089
to secure data processing
and the compliances

158
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,423
depend on the legal environment.

159
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,930
And Geopolitical
Intelligence can also inform

160
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,170
employee education program
for example, reminding us that

161
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,469
there are nation state actors
and out there as well as

162
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,380
organized cyber criminal
networks who can pull together

163
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,510
seemingly small bits of
unguarded information,

164
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,020
social media postings,
even down to identify

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,492
military installations by
a beer rating mobile app.

166
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,550
Many of you may be familiar
with the matrix table

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,099
mapping the stages in the
so called cyber Kill Chain

168
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,947
to activities borrowed from

169
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,210
military information
operations doctrines such as

170
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,210
the tag, deny, disrupt, degree,
receive and the destroy,

171
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,880
aimed at stopping malicious
activities at each stage

172
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,083
that kill chain.

173
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,620
Here is a slightly different
chart of act of focused stages,

174
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,070
which visualize how cyber
threat actors formulate

175
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,304
a malicious goals and pursue
it and the chart identify

176
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:30,733
ways intelligence can
help detect and stop them.

177
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,540
In the following slides, I
will give you some examples of

178
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,319
specific questions that
Geopolitical Intelligence

179
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,153
can answer.

180
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,439
So here is an example of
linguistic and cultural clues

181
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,993
to analyze a campaign.

182
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
After the WannaCry ransom
attack happened in May 2017,

183
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,140
our team did analysis of the
ransom message in Chinese.

184
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,870
We assessed that the
Chinese language ransom note

185
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,870
is not machine translated
from some other language.

186
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,793
The tone of the Chinese is
colloquial and the sarcastic.

187
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,370
In a bit of a person
was native understanding

188
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,050
of Chinese language, as
suggested by the use of phrase

189
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,719
such as lao tian ye,
meaning heavily grandfather,

190
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,860
and (speaking Chinese) meaning a guarantee

191
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,700
was my personal reputation.

192
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,970
So we also noticed a
Chinese character typo

193
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,800
in the ransom note.

194
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,800
This suggests that statement
was the same that was tapped

195
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,400
using the Chinese (mumbles) implementer

196
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,079
as a (mumbles)representation

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,080
of bangzu as b-a-n-g-z-u

198
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,847
and those of bangzhu

199
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,310
as b-a-n-g-z-h-u.

200
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,400
This arrow may point to the
local origins of the writer.

201
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,230
Speakers of local dialects
in China's Northeastern area

202
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,350
of (Chinese speaking) provinces

203
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,073
often mix up the sounds of zi, xi and chi.

204
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,800
So this is enough for us to
create a reasonable suspicion

205
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
that actors behind
WannaCry or at least behind

206
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,740
the Chinese language WannaCry ransom notes

207
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,250
may include people with native level

208
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,250
Chinese language knowledge,

209
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,270
who are familiar with
Chinese online jargon,

210
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,858
or who may have lived in
China's North Eastern Region

211
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,412
bordering North Korea.

212
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,250
Geopolitical Intelligence can
cast lead on the why question,

213
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,260
the bigger strategy and
motives that move stays,

214
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,333
strategies and input cyber criminals.

215
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,479
Geopolitical Intelligence
can help overcome

216
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,480
the cognitive bias of mirror imaging,

217
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,850
that is protecting one's
own worldview, attitudes,

218
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,140
motivations and assumptions

219
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,100
onto someone from a different culture

220
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,610
to understanding the
motives of a state sponsored

221
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,423
cyber operations and the predict
their timing and targets.

222
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,630
We can adapt Carl von
Klausewitz, is a famous maxine,

223
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,410
that war is a continuation
of politics by other means,

224
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,459
to see that cybers right
operations are a continuation

225
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,465
of politics by other means.

226
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:57,465
Cybers operations are just
one to use by state to promote

227
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,170
their strategic interest
along with diplomatic,

228
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,083
economic tools, culture,
software activities,

229
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,410
and military actions.

230
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,050
Therefore, knowing a country's
strategic interests will help

231
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,434
predict when they may use
cyber tools to disrupt

232
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:21,010
and extra filtrate information.

233
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,010
So how they might use for a
larger goal and how much damage

234
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,060
they may inflict along the way.

235
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,969
This does not just apply to
state actors, cyber criminals

236
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,970
also affected by geopolitical
situations in that

237
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,910
the political system and
the strategic interests

238
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,810
of the country where they live
often provides constraints

239
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,622
and incentives to the criminal activity.

240
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,950
Here is an example of an
attack by distro group Sandfish

241
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,350
also known as Sandworm, against
the Republic of Georgia,

242
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,683
to explain why structure do what they do.

243
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,780
On October 28 2019,
thousands of website crashed

244
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,590
or were defaced in the country of Georgia.

245
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,090
The defacement involved
the website being replaced

246
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,090
with pictures of former Jordan
president Nicole Siksha Vile,

247
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,310
standing in front of a Jordan flag,

248
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,420
super imposed with caption I'll be back.

249
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,650
This instance happened
at a time of tension over

250
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,010
Georgia's relationship with
the United States and the NATO.

251
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,620
The US House of Representatives
had passed a bipartisan

252
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,310
Georgia support act on October 22nd.

253
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,750
And the Georgia defense minister had met

254
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,010
with the NATO counterpart on October 24th.

255
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,800
The fact that the defacement
message is in English

256
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,540
was probably an attempt
to portray Shikshavile

257
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,683
as a puppet of the United States.

258
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,349
On February 29, this
year, the United Kingdom

259
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,629
National Cybersecurity Center
and the US State Department

260
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,829
publicly blamed the Russian
government for those disruptive

261
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,830
cyber attack against the country
of Georgia in last October,

262
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,320
following the announcement
on March 29 this year,

263
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,270
our team discovered that
unknown factor have uploaded

264
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,137
the entire database of Jordan
voters in the closed door

265
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,320
Russian language forum for free

266
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,210
in what must have been another
politically motivated attack

267
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,010
against Georgia because
it did not bring profit

268
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,423
for the structures.

269
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,320
Geopolitical analysis
can also cast lead on

270
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,293
when a cyberattack may happen.

271
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,913
In the previous section we
mentioned setting up a mechanism

272
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,680
to monitor significant calendar days

273
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,680
that cyberdefense operations
need to watch closely.

274
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,100
This is because Geopolitical
events could engender

275
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,100
disruptive and explorative
cyber threat activity.

276
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,280
Here is a page from a
central security's 2019

277
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,379
cyberthreat scape report.

278
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,360
Based on the threat actor past behavior,

279
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,030
we list the cyberthreat
activities that may accompany

280
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,210
the key scheduled and unscheduled events.

281
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,770
Occasionally, several threat
actors ranging from hacktivists

282
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,320
to say sponsor actor,
conduct cyber operations

283
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,399
on significant days, or the anniversary

284
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,400
of significant events, such as
anniversary of world war two

285
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,523
victory over Nazi Germany or
a country's independence day.

286
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,119
Geopolitical Intelligence
help an organization

287
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,543
navigate a risky world.

288
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:33,060
Geopolitical Intelligence is
an essential part of preparing

289
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,490
for a strategic decision on
doing business in offsetting

290
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,610
our branches in particular countries.

291
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,290
It also helps executives assess the risk

292
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,780
if they are considering acquisitions

293
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,120
involving foreign parties, or
if a client are considering

294
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,449
joint ventures that could
allow their data to be shared

295
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,633
in foreign countries.

296
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,750
For example, we have analyzed
the cyber criminals threat,

297
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:07,832
landscape and Brazil,
characterizing different categories

298
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,050
of criminals and their ties

299
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,750
with traditional organized crime.

300
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,020
And according to a sort
of Robin Hood ideology

301
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,720
that legitimize domestic
targeting of Brazil's

302
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,050
all rich citizens.

303
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,870
The research assessed
that Brazil's relatively

304
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,350
weak law enforcement efforts
against the cyber crime,

305
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,770
and a population highly
connected through mobile devices,

306
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,750
leaves the field open for
Brazilians cyber criminals

307
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,800
to pursue target within Brazil.

308
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,010
We also see that population
that has generally though,

309
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,720
awareness of cyber risks.

310
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,645
The element of human
fallibility could pose risks

311
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:58,570
for organizations conducting
business in Brazil,

312
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,330
people whether consumers and employees

313
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,923
remain the weakest link.

314
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,490
Educating employees in security
awareness and cyber hygiene

315
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,863
should be a priority for business
operating in that country.

316
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,327
After discussing how Geopolitical
intelligence reinforced

317
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,450
cyberdefense operation, you
may wondering how to make

318
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,290
best the use of Geopolitical Intelligence

319
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,093
may include in your
cyberdefense operations.

320
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,719
Start with intelligence requirements.

321
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,630
Here is a definition of
intelligence requirement

322
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,053
from the US military
doctrine, in cyberdefense,

323
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,030
in cyberspace, cyber Australia
intelligence requirements

324
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,210
follow a similar concept.

325
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,050
You need to understand
your threat environment,

326
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,190
business drivers, strategy,
your critical asset,

327
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,810
most importantly, your adversary.

328
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,070
Then formulate a requirement
questions to be answered

329
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,080
by your cyberthreat intelligence analyst

330
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,320
to better decide your
business asset, partners,

331
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,293
customers and data from cyber actors.

332
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,280
Answer to this question
will help you, your team

333
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,613
and your business leader
make better tactical,

334
00:22:22,613 --> 00:22:27,363
operational strategic
decision across the board.

335
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,600
From intelligence cycle perspective,

336
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,189
after issuance of
intelligence requirements,

337
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,190
then you collect data,
analyze it, and disseminate

338
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,700
the intelligence that results.

339
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,320
Here are sometimes our
Geopolitical Intelligence

340
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,003
proud that the products
and analysts could arise.

341
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,220
An example of alert
intelligence alert here.

342
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,520
So my team's Russian
specialists that did an analysis

343
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,629
about Russian internet sovereignty law

344
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,830
and its possible cyber implications.

345
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,620
Another example here is a
Brazilian energy sectors

346
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,040
threat assessment.

347
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,430
We include economic factors

348
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,510
and the geopolitical
considerations in the industry,

349
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,963
Australia landscapes.

350
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,490
Other examples such as
malicious event, global event

351
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,390
in the global event
example my team recorded

352
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,710
COVID-19 outbreak on
January 23rd this year,

353
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,830
which was in the very early
stage of the pandemic,

354
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,310
which provide a starting
point for us to look into

355
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,312
related threat activities.

356
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,310
After we learn about the greatness of

357
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,850
Geopolitical Intelligence
in threat intelligence,

358
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,879
you may be wondering how to practice

359
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,633
Geopolitical intelligence.

360
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,400
Four key elements about practice
Geopolitical Intelligence.

361
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,050
Start with the Geopolitical
Intelligence team,

362
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,000
hire analysts with
culture, linguistic skills.

363
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,040
Cyber security industry need
people with computer science

364
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,040
degree but also liberal arts
degrees for the mission.

365
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,020
In my company's Geopolitical
Intelligence team,

366
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,786
we have subject matter
experts with Dr. degree

367
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:33,300
of Russian history and experts
with experience worked with

368
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,680
Iraq coalition forces.

369
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,730
So educate your team on
analytical techniques

370
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,020
and discipline.

371
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Know your source, interrogating
the sources of information

372
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
to assess whether they are
believable, tracing back to find

373
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,163
the original source in
multiple language possible.

374
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,184
Lastly, coordination and
communication are very important

375
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:03,080
to improve intelligence product quality,

376
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,903
and organization cyber security posture.

377
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,580
Here, I list some sources
for your reference,

378
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,679
some of them I have
referenced in this talk

379
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,843
and maybe help you for your future study.

380
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,500
This comes to the end of my presentation.

381
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,810
So how to apply what
you have learned today.

382
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,159
I have some suggestions.

383
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,990
This all depends on your current
organizational structure,

384
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,360
and the individual
cybersecurity maturities.

385
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,382
You can adapt it for your needs.
