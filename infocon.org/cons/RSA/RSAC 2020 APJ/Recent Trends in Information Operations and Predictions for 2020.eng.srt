1
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:09,469
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,230

I'd now like to turn
it over to you, Yao Lim

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,053
for the presentation.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,370
- Hi guys, thank you Bridah.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,202
Welcome everyone,

13
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:00,220
I'm very excited for you
to have to be with me today

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,170
on the topic of Information
Operation Trends in 2020.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,120
My name is Yao, I'm from Singapore,

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,283
and please join me today to
learn more about this topic.

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,550
Right, So starting from the top,

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,899
I just want to define
Information Operations.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,240
As you can see from here,

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,570
I will try to explain a little
bit on the who, what, where,

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,869
when, why of Information Operations.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,060
So information operations is basically

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,970
a form of information
attack by different actors,

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,140
and who is behind this?

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,510
It would be people with
political motivations,

26
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,440
political ambitions,

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,390
some people with observations

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,390
or wants to make a troll comments
about incidents of people

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,900
or cyber criminals trying
to make some money, right.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
When your data appear,

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,759
typically this kind of information appear

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,500
across social media,

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,840
about right now we see them
appearing also on forums

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,330
and news channels, video sharing websites,

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,539
or even chat applications.

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,270
And what is it about basically?

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,039
It's, it is about the distortion

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,200
or deception of news information

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,709
in order to promote a certain narrative

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,650
or to promote certain ideology

41
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,473
that is not secondly correct, right.

42
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:23,890
Last but not least,

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,130
when did we see the first IO?

44
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,490
It is made famous by the 2016
US presidential elections

45
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,300
where there was alleged
Russian interference

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,360
and ever since that point,

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,093
It has stuck around globally.

48
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,079
And was it effective?

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,990
It is because of humans are
still unable to identify

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,850
whether it is true or not

51
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,540
because fact-checking based
on information we receive

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,209
on a mobile phone is still a new concept.

53
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,620
People still tend to
believe that messages sent

54
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,620
from friends and family are
real and 100% correct, right.

55
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,799
So where have we seen this before?

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,230
As you can see from this photo here,

57
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,519
it is actually the speech of a tabloid

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,440
and it actually from the
past, like 40, 50 years ago,

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,713
we've already seen tabloid
magazines using fake news,

60
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:20,140
or exaggerated headlines
to get people's attention,

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,609
to buy their magazine or buy their papers,

62
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,410
and it has to a certain
extent be controlled

63
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,950
because everybody knows

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,820
that this kind of magazine is a tabloid,

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,500
it's a fake magazines,
it's just speculation.

66
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,430
But right now in social media,

67
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,510
it is not so clear to users

68
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,640
because it appears out of context

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,769
because it could be shipped
from a trusted person

70
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,420
hence the information that's
coming from the trusted person

71
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,089
would be easily manipulated

72
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,980
and people might think that it is real

73
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,010
as compared to a tabloid magazine

74
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,769
where it's already known
to be a source of fake news

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,823
or speculated news or
sensationalized news.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,263
Right, so now moving on,

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,079
I, want to share a little bit

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,150
on the implications of
Information operations.

79
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,910
So you can see from here,

80
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,440
that actually it is one of the
infamous incidents in 2016,

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,840
where a man was actually convinced

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,769
that a Pizza restaurant contained

83
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,229
a hidden pedophile tracking ring

84
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,410
that was allegedly led by Hillary Clinton

85
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,210
and her presidential campaign,

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,909
and this guy took things
into his own hands

87
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,610
and he tried to shoot
up a Pizza restaurant.

88
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,860
And this is actually
information that was coming

89
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,490
from a website instead
was inauthentic or fake

90
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,470
and then further tweeted by
people across many nations,

91
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,670
Czech Republic, Cypress,
Vietnam via inauthentic box

92
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,340
and to this person, this are real people

93
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,500
and he took the information in wrongly,

94
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,160
he had a misinterpretation of this

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,600
and he went to take
action into his own hands,

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,650
luckily no one was hurt in this incident.

97
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,740
We also see Information Operations

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,447
by the Russians on the U.S.
presidential elections in 2016,

99
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:04,750
trying to spoof black lives matters group

100
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,140
and in this case, trying to
show the Confederate flag

101
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,020
and trying to disseminate

102
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,143
negative sentiment in America itself.

103
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,010
In Asia, we also see a similar
case of this happening,

104
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,310
where you can see on the
picture on your left,

105
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:25,289
where you can see this
screenshots were taken

106
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,210
from official Facebook
account Myanmar military

107
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,630
and it was trying to show
evidence of a conflict

108
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,200
in Myanmar's Rakhine state in the 1940s

109
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,659
and how there was a negative
tensions and hostility

110
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,400
between two ethnic groups,

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,640
but actually this images
were repurposed from

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,380
Bangladesh War of Independence
from Pakistan in 1971.

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,370
Right, so this is a very
clear case of infamous photos

114
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,080
being used by people who have

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,043
a political agenda behind them,

116
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,030
right, and as we know already
2016 presidential election

117
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,227
was successful and it caused a big ,

118
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,540
sort of like a big loss
of image across the world

119
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,730
and right now we're seeing more

120
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,570
Nations, States that are
adopting Information Operations

121
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,120
in support of their own
political ambitions.

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,440
So out of the normal evil people
like Russia, China or Iran,

123
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,250
we are seeing new countries emerging

124
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,620
to take control of Information Space,

125
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,390
especially social media internet
such as Venezuela, Cuba,

126
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,060
Saudi Arabia, and UAE as well.

127
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,910
Usually this kind of activity is used

128
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,373
just before the election period

129
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,873
to influence people's
people's minds and decisions

130
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,159
and they are encouraged by the fact that

131
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,210
the 2016 elections proved
that this kind of operations

132
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,131
can be effective and people
are actually able to push

133
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,881
their political ambitions across.

134
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:56,750
Over here it's interesting

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,940
because, we are seeing
heightened awareness about IO,

136
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,930
so right now the social media
platforms, the big ones,

137
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,230
Twitter, Facebook, are aware that

138
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,022
these are being misused by actors

139
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:11,900
who further pursue their
political ambitions

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,469
and because of this,

141
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,250
the social media platforms
are also doing more

142
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,400
to strengthen, secure the
platforms by deleting fake pages,

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,169
fake accounts, leading
to a situation where

144
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,430
actors now are paying very high attention

145
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,880
to their Operational Security

146
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,210
that they're increasingly
adopting more elaborate

147
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,210
personas, to show that it's a real person

148
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,620
and not so out rightly fake,

149
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,770
but in some cases the
actors still making mistakes

150
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,270
but we are able to catch them

151
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,599
and we're be able to
identify and see the netbook

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,210
of fake activity and actually
it's interesting, but now,

153
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,620
because we are in the
middle of the COVID pandemic

154
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,700
and we are seeing increased IO activity

155
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,823
that is around the COVID situation.

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,460
To me it's interesting as a researcher

157
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,780
because it shows that
actually IO is no longer

158
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,969
just limited to elections.

159
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,060
It also can be applied to anything

160
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,200
that has political implications.

161
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,650
So in terms of this COVID
situation right now,

162
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,609
it is linked very heavily to
how governments are dealing

163
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,220
with the pandemic, how governments
are solving the problems,

164
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,350
putting measures, giving
budget that have to help people

165
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,150
with everyday lives.

166
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,640
And a lot of actors are
making use of this opportunity

167
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,909
to insert fake messages,

168
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,600
to either steal people's
social security numbers,

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,390
credit card numbers, or addresses, PII

170
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,690
or just to spread
conspiracy theories about

171
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,950
how this virus has been made up in the lab

172
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,910
and it's deliberately spread
around to kill people,

173
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,742
that kind of thing.

174
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:48,880
So, this is being misused
by actors of all sorts

175
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,713
at this point.

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,680
And we think that it
will be a growing trend

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,670
because other future topics of interest

178
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,670
that have political implications
might have the same impact.

179
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,500
And I'll dive in a little bit into

180
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,090
the types of Information Operations,

181
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,430
so there's Authentic and
as you know Inauthentic,

182
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,489
under the Authentic bracket
you can see from here

183
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,630
there're five types of
Information Operations,

184
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,760
first one is Disinformation

185
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,950
where it can be rumors
or falsehoods spread

186
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,040
to undermine national security,

187
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,400
part of state sponsored campaigns,

188
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,740
which could be a coordinated
campaign and there're some

189
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,740
that are spread for information
gain, sorry Financial gain,

190
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,040
false food say spread for financial gain,

191
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,810
websites using very
eye catching headlines,

192
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,930
attention seeking content, controversial

193
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,709
to gain traffic to the website and

194
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,320
from there they post
advertisements to gain revenues

195
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,090
for the founders.

196
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,820
We see websites using
Information Campaigns

197
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
for Entertainment spreading
falsehoods, imparity, or humor

198
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,070
as you can see from the
screenshot over there,

199
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,770
we also see information
thats spread With Agenda

200
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,480
within the country itself by
different political parties,

201
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,110
with different interpretation of the facts

202
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,220
based on their already ideological bias.

203
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,380
Last but not least we see
information that's spread,

204
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,760
misinformation that's
spread without agenda

205
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,990
by everyday people like ourselves

206
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,760
when we receive messages on
WhatsApp from our loved ones

207
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,060
and then we spread them before them

208
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,030
without any political aim,

209
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,709
but because of our actions,

210
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,680
it will lead to a spread and dissemination

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,079
of this kind of false foods.

212
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,770
In the second category, second
bucket we have to, you know,

213
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,920
tend it to category where it
is very clearly, you know,

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,020
inauthentic profiles,
behavior is of robot,

215
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,770
is of robot behavior.

216
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,600
So we can see from the
bottom left head screen,

217
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,883
that profile pictures of people

218
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:48,310
were actually generated by
computer called deepfakes,

219
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,979
which I'll share a little bit later.

220
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,440
Basically these photos
are not a real people.

221
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,030
They look like real
people, but they're not

222
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,500
and there are certain
telltale signs of why

223
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,650
they are not real people and
they're computer generated.

224
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,663
And you can see from the right side where

225
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:04,320
you can, the right side there's
a photographer's screenshot

226
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,110
to show accounts that are seemingly

227
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,210
trying to propagate conversations

228
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,683
based on the sudden hashtag,

229
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,430
to show that is going viral.

230
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,160
So to the unsuspecting eye,

231
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,980
you would think that, hey,
this is getting viral,

232
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,437
I need to be aware of this,

233
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,670
but actually it is still
done by the same group which

234
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,420
just spreading and re sharing the message

235
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,173
or re tweeting the message
over and over again.

236
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,700
Some of the trends that we
are seeing on 2020 right now,

237
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,760
we are seeing five major trends,

238
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,260
so let me just highlight
the five few right now.

239
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,260
First is the amplification
of organic content

240
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,510
and planting of false content
in the YouTube channels.

241
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,340
Second would be multimedia manipulation

242
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,330
and the use of deepfakes, third would be,

243
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,670
you know, inauthentic news outlets.

244
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,880
Fourth would be the use of
public marketing companies

245
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,610
to conduct Information Operations,

246
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,310
and the last but not least would be

247
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,683
to use Information Operations
by non state actors.

248
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,006
Right, now I'll give,

249
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm going to a little bit more deep dive

250
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
on each one of the five,

251
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,353
the first part,

252
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:17,209
where we talk about
amplification of organic content

253
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,640
and planting of false information
in legitimate channels,

254
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,740
you can see from here,

255
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,960
there was an organic Content,

256
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,820
it means content that's created
by the actors themselves.

257
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,540
So we can see from the here,

258
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,569
the right side of the screen,

259
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,110
there's actually a
fabricated communications

260
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,890
and correspondence, which
is appear to be sent

261
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,569
from the Lithuanian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs

262
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,230
and in this press release itself,

263
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,240
it claims that the U.S.
will build a military base

264
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,663
for storing nuclear weapons in Lithuania.

265
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,970
And actually it led to a lot
of problems in that region

266
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,520
because it heightened tensions

267
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,780
around the Eastern European region.

268
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,600
People think that the U.S. is gonna have

269
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,450
a military presence style,

270
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,290
the pro-American, anti-American
factions within that country

271
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,939
actually had some conflict, right.

272
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,740
So this actually claims to be
from the Lithuania Government

273
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,970
but it's not.

274
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,420
And the second example
that I have for you,

275
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,770
as you can see from the
slide will be this KUNA,

276
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,040
which is a Kuwait state-run news agency

277
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,790
that was apparently compromised and made

278
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,980
claims that American forces

279
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,970
would be withdrawn from
Kuwait immediately.

280
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,370
The problem with these kind of statements

281
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,050
from News Agency would be that,

282
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,390
it would stabilize or destabilize

283
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,090
the immediate situation
in the Middle East itself

284
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,900
and as you know Middle East is a very,

285
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,760
it's an area of high tensions

286
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,310
and a lot of animosity
between rival countries

287
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,599
or groups of factions

288
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,650
and this kind of information actually led

289
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,260
to a certain set of escalation
amongst the Middle East,

290
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,610
when it was first released.

291
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,070
Inauthentic news outlets
the said trend number two,

292
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,407
as you can see from here

293
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,060
that we have seen from the past that,

294
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,739
and we think that IO actors
will continue to leverage

295
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,110
their own inauthentic news
sites to produce new articles

296
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,380
that are aligned with
their political interest.

297
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,230
And across 2018, 2019 itself,
we had a team in FireEye

298
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,810
that investigated,

299
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,969
and we were able to find out
there're a lot of News sites

300
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,430
that are apparently of Iranian origin

301
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,500
that are aimed at audiences
globally to spread

302
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,520
the narrative that are aligned

303
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,069
with the political interests of Iran.

304
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,480
And this is not just
limited to websites itself,

305
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,890
but we are seeing social
media presence included,

306
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,600
including Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, Google, YouTube,

307
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,620
Tumblr, to spread news articles

308
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,860
or give perspective on
certain current events

309
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,040
that are incorrect,

310
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,203
but these are actually biased
toward Iranian Interests.

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,780
The third trend we see over here is

312
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,913
the use of Public Relations,
Marketing firms for IO.

313
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,349
We have seen that this has
been actively and successfully

314
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,580
implemented by actors across the world,

315
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,580
not just Iran and as a screenshot,

316
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,330
you can see over here,

317
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,050
there're different
accounts that are seemingly

318
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,553
spreading the same message,

319
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,750
and we believe the actors are hiring

320
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,430
marketing public relations
companies to do this

321
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,620
because they have a
very good understanding

322
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,350
on the online influence sphere,

323
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,410
and like I mentioned just now, 2018, 2019,

324
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,270
our team in FireEye investigated

325
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,670
and we found a number of News sites

326
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,689
that are aimed at audiences globally

327
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,090
that are actually of Iranian origin

328
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,950
or spreading interests
that are aligned with Iran.

329
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,950
And further investigation
actually led to some findings

330
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,570
that, you know, some of the
website's registration data

331
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,130
were linked to marketing firm

332
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,310
based in India.

333
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,209
So basically some actors
actually outsource this

334
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,420
to certain firms to do it,

335
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,810
and interestingly, we have also
seen this in Southeast Asia,

336
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,280
an open source report by
Bellingcat also revealed

337
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,020
that some of the Information Operations

338
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,500
that were done in Papua, New Guinea by

339
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,360
Indonesian government,

340
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,283
actually has links to India's
marketing company as well.

341
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,080
Next would be a trend of IO
that is by Non-state actors

342
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,300
and by that I mean, actors that
are not governments itself.

343
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,990
So in the period of the 2016 elections,

344
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,800
we have seen this
website called, thebl.com

345
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,900
that is very pro-Trump
and pro-political material

346
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,433
that is in support of the right,
the right traditional site.

347
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,780
And this is a website that
actually maintains pages

348
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,339
in English, Chinese, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Vietnamese,

349
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,760
and further investigations into this group

350
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,510
and its background and affiliations

351
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,550
actually led us to find
out that this is linked

352
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,240
to the Falun Gong group in China.

353
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,590
So Falun Gong is actually
a group of people

354
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,589
that have been banned in
China as a cult since 1999

355
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,240
and we believe they're trying to spread

356
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,240
anti-China, anti-Eastern
material and ideas

357
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,290
because, and sorry,

358
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,470
they are trying to spread ideas

359
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,700
in support of president Trump,

360
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,030
because they know that president Trump

361
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,700
will take a tough stance against China,

362
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
which will be aligned with what they are,

363
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,730
what they're trying to do,

364
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,680
because they are actually being
banned by China themselves.

365
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,629
Next would be this part
about media manipulation

366
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,280
and Deepfakes.

367
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,090
So we assess with high confidence
that actors will continue

368
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,510
to explore this artificial intelligence

369
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,350
and deepfake technologies
within 2020 itself and beyond.

370
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,939
So if we already see people
using, inauthentic Twitter,

371
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,463
Facebook, Instagram accounts,

372
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,640
and these actually being used to support

373
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,100
the Cuban government and show that

374
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,050
they are critical of the U.S government

375
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,080
and many of them are
using fake photos itself

376
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,280
as you can see from here

377
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,070
and recent research done

378
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,050
by a university of Washington right,

379
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,090
shows that actually,

380
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,770
it is possible to input even
audio of the real person

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,000
and using their recurrent neural
netbook of mouth synthesis,

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
you can show that his lip is
moving to a certain rhythm

383
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,159
that almost looks like
the person is talking

384
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,000
and hence with the same voice, same face

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,140
and similar authentic
looking lip movements.

386
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,040
It looks like the person is speaking

387
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,453
and saying the message as himself.

388
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,389
So this has a very big implication

389
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,850
because it can potentially
affect a lot of political,

390
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,469
geopolitical tensions
and situations globally.

391
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,303
When a leader

392
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:47,880
can be made to say something
that's controversial

393
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,720
and that might even lead to escalations

394
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,610
such as physical confrontations
or riots or protests

395
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,060
and leading to a lot of
anti sentiment spreading.

396
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,360
At this point, I would
like to show you a video

397
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,560
that is from Channel News Asia, So enjoy.

398
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,360
- Via digital manipulation of video

399
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,669
it can make someone do

400
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,900
or say something

401
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,620
they didn't in real life.

402
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,033
This technology is called deepfake.

403
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,739
This is a deepfake.

404
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:26,011
(soft music)

405
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,290
- [Narrator] While it
showed inconsistent results,

406
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,530
mostly failing on poorly lit
or low resolution photographs.

407
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,610
It can be scarily convincing

408
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,199
if you feed it the right photographs.

409
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,227
This means some of the people

410
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:03,440
who are most vulnerable to
deepfake manipulation now

411
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,400
are people who post plenty
of high quality images

412
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,973
of themselves online.

413
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,134
(upbeat music)

414
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,679
- Yeah sorry I was on mute.

415
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,367
So basically want to show you that

416
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,420
that's the clip over there

417
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,460
is that everybody will be
affected to some extent.

418
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,610
So not just political figures,
not just prominent people

419
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,050
but everyday people as well.

420
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,230
If you have a friend ,that has a comp,

421
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,760
that's angry with you, upset with you

422
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,900
or jealous boyfriend ex-girlfriend,

423
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,800
they could potentially use your image

424
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,760
for malicious purposes as well,

425
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,470
to spread negative
sentiments about you, right.

426
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,700
So now we know that there's
a big phenomena going on

427
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,840
about Information Operations,
fake news, misinformation,

428
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
disinformation, I want
to share a little bit

429
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,420
about the legislations
around the world, right?

430
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,150
So government are also aware at this point

431
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,270
that people are misusing actors,

432
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,720
actors of different kinds are misusing

433
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,730
this Information Operations
for their own gain

434
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,970
and they're actually putting
up a lot of laws around them

435
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,960
to be controlling that
situation right now.

436
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,020
And you can see from here,

437
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,060
not just the ones that
are shown on this slide,

438
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,690
but at least 20, 30
countries around the world

439
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,070
already put in similar laws,

440
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,990
because I'm from Singapore,

441
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,820
I'll go in a little bit deeper about

442
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,960
what Singapore has done,

443
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,640
what's curbing this kind of information,

444
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,180
but you can see from here
that European union, Russia,

445
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,090
France, Germany, and
Malaysia itself are also

446
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,572
putting in laws to control
this kind of situation.

447
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,860
Just diving in a little bit deeper

448
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,370
about the situation in
Singapore right now.

449
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,959
So Singapore is known for the POFMA law,

450
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,020
which is online protection
from online falsehoods

451
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,490
and manipulation.

452
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,000
It's actually supposed to prevent

453
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,440
the electronic communication of falsehoods

454
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,280
and online platforms on websites.

455
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,870
And why is there a need for POFMA?

456
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,600
Because we have seen an
increase of fake news and hoaxes

457
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,850
that are shared about multiple incidents.

458
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,540
So one incident I'm
gonna share with you here

459
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,280
would be the collapse of a roof

460
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,649
at Punggol Waterway Terraces.

461
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,930
So it's a private apartment in Singapore

462
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,270
and apparently there were
some people who shared a video

463
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,629
or sorry, a photo of this coloured roof

464
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,520
and put it on a website
called All Singapore Stuff

465
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
and this website is actually
not a real news website,

466
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,290
it's a private news website
that is widely, is very viral,

467
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,010
and people would like to
read this website a lot,

468
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,550
and hence it got spread
to a big group of people

469
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,100
in a very short amount of time.

470
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,740
And because of this big
incident hoax happening, right?

471
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,120
The police, the civil
defense and various agencies

472
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,250
were engaged and activated
to go on site to fix

473
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,710
because they were
expecting mass casualties.

474
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,930
However they arrived on site and realized

475
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,740
that there was no such damage done at all.

476
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,000
So the government was concerned

477
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,420
about this kind of thing reoccurring,

478
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,850
that's why they actually did
created this piece of a law

479
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,763
to curb this kind of online behavior.

480
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,280
Having said that, right,

481
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,320
this is actually a very
controversial topic

482
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,480
because some of them,

483
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,440
some people might think
that it's a limitation

484
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,530
of freedom of speech.

485
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,330
So some of the impact of
businesses operating in Singapore

486
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,820
would be, would be to be aware this law

487
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,580
and basically the first
thing you have to do

488
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,500
is make sure that your
digital content and views

489
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,710
and articles are all factual and accurate.

490
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,020
Basically you something,
you have some sort of data

491
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,990
to back up what you claim

492
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,650
and I would say for businesses

493
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,640
who want to operate in Singapore itself,

494
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,820
you have also got to be aware

495
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,860
of the expectations
around for human speech,

496
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,360
because we are in a little bit
different political climate

497
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,750
from the America, the Americas,

498
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,880
hence, there's a need to balance this

499
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,410
against the geopolitical
climate in Singapore

500
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,890
and if there's any need to publish content

501
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,810
that is a little bit
unsubstantiated, please label it out,

502
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,179
you call it out and say
that it is my opinion

503
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,600
that ABC is happening
and maybe provide context

504
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,649
and even opposing views to
what some people would say

505
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,890
against what you think
or what you have created,

506
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,590
or the statement that you've made.

507
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,990
Last but not least in the
content that you create

508
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,220
you should also try to
avoid sensitive topics

509
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,530
along the lines of promoting
hate or racial tensions,

510
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,530
religious problems of
social progress themes,

511
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,540
inclusive themes, something like that,

512
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,950
because these are likely to
generate negative sentiments

513
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,080
in Singapore and unless you
should not try to touch them

514
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,820
unless they're absolutely
relevant to your line of business.

515
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,149
So there's actually a legaladvice.com,

516
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,000
a website that you should refer to,

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,223
if you have such a need that arises.

518
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,110
Over here you can see the next slide of

519
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,540
some of the POFMA implementation
in Singapore itself,

520
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,040
we've seen the government,

521
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,350
we have seen the government
use them against groups

522
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,250
that are trying to
spread false information

523
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,170
about the budget that is
being pushed to help people

524
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,449
and we are also seeing
them try to push the law

525
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,300
to opposition parties

526
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,590
that are making incorrect claims
based on perceived biased,

527
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,163
based on ideological bias,

528
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,640
we are also seeing private companies

529
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,330
or private Facebook groups

530
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,960
that are calling themselves
National Times Singapore

531
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,093
seemingly, state-sponsored websites

532
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:39,750
that are showing incorrect
polls on social media.

533
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,620
So there's already been
a lot of implementation

534
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,572
of this happening in Singapore itself.

535
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,330
So what's next for us,

536
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,300
as we know that many countries are

537
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,600
now going to perceive
Information Operations

538
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,993
as an effective weapon, right?

539
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:56,419
It will also mean one thing,

540
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,740
as they know that it is something

541
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,840
that can be used to attack them,

542
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,370
they will also be likely to
use it to attack their rivals

543
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,533
because it's like a
double edge sword, right?

544
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,429
Secondly, the COVID-19 situation

545
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,720
is also a good indication for us to show

546
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,830
that how current affairs
can lead to IO campaigns.

547
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,970
As long as there's a political implication

548
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,210
leading to the current affairs or events

549
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,690
it could be a sporting event as well.

550
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,900
We can see actors trying
to leverage that situation

551
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,750
to generate certain narratives

552
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,873
by inserting messages
that are trying to point

553
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:35,503
users to a certain
direction of their thinking.

554
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,120
And this will be only useful

555
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,570
and even more effective
with the use of deepfake,

556
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,399
because they can now
impersonate famous people

557
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,890
using the origins of voice

558
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,639
and making them look
like they're saying it

559
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,750
in a video format form for
their further operations.

560
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,910
So we think that this will
be a continuous situation

561
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,490
and trend where actors
will continually explore

562
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,690
the tools of AI and deepfake
technology throughout 2020

563
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,523
and beyond.

564
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah, some of the references
that I've made when

565
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,510
whatever I've used when
I was thinking the deck

566
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,773
and I want to thank the people behind us,

567
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,180
some of the stuffs are good,
this is the apply slide.

568
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,980
After this session,
ideally you should be able

569
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,810
to be more skeptical about
what you see online now,

570
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,710
and always remember to cross-reference,

571
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,160
meaning you cross-reference
what you see on Facebook

572
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,580
with a legitimate government source

573
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,360
to make sure that
information is consistent

574
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,000
and only with that happening,

575
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,570
then you should probably
trust what you read.

576
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,159
By that having said that, right,

577
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,930
sometimes websites can be compromised.

578
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,350
Like what you see in Kuwait News Agency

579
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,810
who share information that's incorrect.

580
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,599
So even that you have to
be a little bit skeptical,

581
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,049
take a little bit or so
with what you see online.

582
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,760
And in three and six months period,

583
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,690
hopefully you'll be
able to educate friends

584
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,720
on potential dangerous implication

585
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,510
of Information Operations

586
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,910
and if you receive
information from your friends

587
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,120
in terms of like from your
personal WhatsApp groups

588
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,060
or telegram groups,

589
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,270
you'll be able to decide
for them and tell friends

590
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,129
that is not working for you, right.

591
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,110
So if it's been six
months and you forget it,

592
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,679
if you forget about
what was said you know,

593
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,280
you can just go back to
my slide to get, right.

594
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,610
And that's all I have for you today.

595
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,570
If you have any questions,

596
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,700
please refer to Slido

597
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,090
and I will be there to
answer your questions.

598
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,913
Thank you very much, thank you guys.
