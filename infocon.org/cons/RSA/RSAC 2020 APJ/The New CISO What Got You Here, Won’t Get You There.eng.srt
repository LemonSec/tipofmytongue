1
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:12,273
- Think you're special?

2
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,420
One of the kind?

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,600
We agree.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,353
The way you pursue your digital
ambitions is unique to you

5
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,890
and so is your appetite for digital risk,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,080
whether you're hyper-connecting
your ecosystem,

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,240
empowering a distributed workforce,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,070
rapidly leveraging cloud, IOT,
AI or other new technologies,

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,770
RSA is here to help you
manage digital risk your way

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,960
at every stage of your journey.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,337
So go ahead, be you.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,580
- Hello and welcome to The New CISO,

13

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,419
for the presentation.

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,370
- Thank you, Casey.

22
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,233
Let me get to the slide here.

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,149
As Casey noted, thank you
for the introduction, Casey,

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,590
as Casey noted I'm Stan Lowe.

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm the Global Chief
Information Security Officer

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,490
for Zscaler.

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,800
Our talk today is going
to be about The New Ciso,

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,523
What Got You Here, Won't Get You There.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,660
Real quick, a little bit about me.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,603
I've been kicking around for awhile.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,230
I joined the Navy in 1983 and literally

32
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,680
one of my first exposure
to networking and computer

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,440
was with Admiral Grace Hopper

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,880
when she visited our bootcamp company

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,310
and tried to convince everybody that IT

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,270
was an awesome thing to
do and actually handed out

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,563
nanoseconds, which I still have mine.

38
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,610
I don't have it with me
because I'm moving house

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,700
and it's packed up.

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,160
But, so kicked around, I spent
a lot of time in the Navy,

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,783
got out, went to work for
DARPA, a couple of startups,

42
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:05,320
a lot of time in the U S government.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,300
My last U.S government job,

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,810
I was the Deputy Assistant Secretary

45
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,068
for the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs

46
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,540
and it's Chief Information
Security Officer,

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,600
and subsequent to that, a
bunch of different boards,

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,710
advisory boards, private companies

49
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,520
and I've been with Zscaler
for about two years now

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,200
as their Global Chief
Information Security Officer.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,850
So one of the things that
we need to talk about is

52
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,019
how most of us, CISOs, got our jobs,

53
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,610
and basically how we
ended up where we are.

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,380
So a lot of us got them like I did

55
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,940
and show you which was I knew

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,970
because we were sort of one of
the best technicians around.

57
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,240
We were good at networking, we
were good at cyber security,

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,060
we were good technically at our jobs.

59
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,973
We knew the tools inside out,

60
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,170
we knew the technology inside out

61
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,549
and we knew the procedures inside and out.

62
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,900
And essentially we got promoted
over, over and over again

63
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,733
into...

64
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,270
And this is not necessarily
true for everybody,

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,300
but it's true for the vast majority of us.

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,557
And one of the things is we got
promoted from or to our jobs

67
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,950
and our current positions because

68
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,060
we looked at the, and
our organizations frankly

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,520
looked at our roles as tech.

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,620
We were a technical role

71
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,010
that basically allowed the
protected the IT infrastructure

72
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,000
from bad guys and stuff like that.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,503
So the interesting thing is

74
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:31,070
we were perfectly suited for that.

75
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,959
And it's interesting in that
when we were doing that,

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,640
we basically looked at
ourselves and we thought,

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,452
yeah hey, we're pretty good.

78
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,753
When we looked at ourselves like,

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,700
essentially, whoops, I
need to go back there,

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,420
a little too far of a click,

81
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,886
how we see ourselves is we
are super heroes and we are,

82
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:55,093
for the most part we are.

83
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,080
We protect our enterprises
in our environments

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,840
from bad people trying to do
bad things to our business.

85
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,470
And it's not unlike this but oftentimes

86
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,940
when we're approaching our role

87
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,720
from a technical perspective,

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,150
this is how we look at ourselves.

89
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,850
Unfortunately, our roles
as we said in the title,

90
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,190
are starting to change

91
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,519
and oftentimes our businesses
look at us like the guys that

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,460
everybody recognizes these
guys from "Home Alone"

93
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,650
we do security to them, we
do do security for them.

94
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,919
And oftentimes

95
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,711
one of the things that we
need to start thinking about

96
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,010
is even though what got
us in our current roles,

97
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,130
we were super duper technologists

98
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,407
and IT security was viewed or

99
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:42,120
(mumbles) was viewed as a tactical role,

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,993
that is no longer the case.

101
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,380
So one of the things
that we have to recognize

102
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,115
is this driving this change

103
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:55,790
is how we work when we work
and where we work is changing

104
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,029
and that has never been more
evident than in the last 120,

105
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:02,969
104 months.

106
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,290
Essentially our
organizations have dispersed

107
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,300
to the four winds.

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,210
Our people working from
home as much as we can,

109
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,450
if depending on what vertical you're in,

110
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,409
we're moving our people and
our business processes outside

111
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,520
of a traditional IT architecture.

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,570
And we're looking at having
to support all of those

113
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,849
working from literally anywhere.

114
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,200
And we oftentimes talk about,

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,170
oh, the internet of things,
internet of manufacturing,

116
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,140
the internet of this,
the internet of that.

117
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,159
I was talking with Gary Hayslip,

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,450
who is a CISO buddy of mine,
who is the CISO at Softbank,

119
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,283
and we were talking about,

120
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:40,990
and he said the internet
is now everything.

121
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,340
The internet is everything
to us as IT professionals,

122
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,849
as cyber security professionals

123
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,580
and it's everything to our business

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,690
because how we look at
how our businesses operate

125
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,830
is what we need to make sure that

126
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,200
we change the way that we
think and what that means is

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,000
effectively, we need to
evolve what we think about

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,660
how it means to be a CISO.

129
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,080
Our jobs are no longer technical jobs.

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
Our jobs are basically
based upon the architectures

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,230
that we're having to move to

132
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,370
and where our businesses are going

133
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,630
is we have to think about our role

134
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,590
with regards to how our businesses

135
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,900
need to do what they need to
do to be able to do two things,

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,929
two primary things for
the vast majority of us

137
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,940
and that's protecting drive revenue.

138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,940
And we need to understand
where our role fits into that.

139
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,210
So that means you can't
be the king of CISOs,

140
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,340
we put the no in innovation.

141
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,849
You can't actually look at your role

142
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,440
as a technology role anymore.

143
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,150
Your role is now a
business enablement role

144
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,643
and you need to understand where you

145
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,870
can provide value to your organizations.

146
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,940
Are you able to provide
value to your businesses

147
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,620
to allow them to use the
tools and technologies

148
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,000
that they need

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,167
to be able to do the things
that the C level organizations

150
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,090
are requiring them to
do to be able to protect

151
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,119
and drive revenue?

152
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,260
You need to figure out
what your role is in that

153
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,520
and that means you've got to
get out of your comfort zone.

154
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,900
That means you have to
get up out of your office.

155
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,109
You have to walk into

156
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,350
and you can't manage by fiat
anymore, you can't do to them.

157
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,910
Security now is a speed
bump, not a roadblock.

158
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,720
We talk about DevSecOps and
all this sort of stuff there.

159
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
There've been plenty of marketing terms

160
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,990
that have come in and
out of security DevOps

161
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,666
is on its way out or is on its way in.

162
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,030
We're seeing a lot of evidence about that,

163
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,030
but all of those are really
symptoms of a problem in that

164
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,900
a lot of us that are in our roles,

165
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,039
CISOs have a tendency

166
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,610
to view our roles as technologists.

167
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,790
We are no longer, as
I've said, technologists.

168
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,480
Our job is about business enablement

169
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,010
and allowing our organization
to use tools and technologies

170
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,030
within the risk parameters,

171
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,059
the risk comfort of your organization,

172
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,760
but our job is to make sure that our folks

173
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,349
can access applications and data

174
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,673
from literally anywhere
and still be able to

175
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:17,070
protect the organization
within the risk parameters

176
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,090
that the organization is comfortable with.

177
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,799
So that means we have to
start thinking about us,

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,390
thinking about our role,

179
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,760
thinking about our interaction
with both our peers,

180
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,520
because a lot of us are now moving off

181
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,380
from underneath the CIO

182
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,874
and are moving underneath
becoming peers with a CIO

183
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,929
or moving out completely
reporting to the CFO,

184
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,020
directly to the Chief Operating Officer

185
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,470
or we're proding to the
Chief Legal Officer.

186
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,179
We're starting to be recognized

187
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,780
as that's getting us more of a voice

188
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,319
in how the business protects itself,

189
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,870
how the risk is assessed and managed,

190
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,860
but it also puts us in the role

191
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,780
of being business enablement.

192
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,670
And that is incredibly important

193
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,390
as you start to change your mindset.

194
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,400
When that happens, they're
gonna look for you like,

195
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,760
okay, we wanna use application
A or application B,

196
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,550
how are you gonna enable us to do that?

197
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,780
And you can't say no,

198
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,530
because what they'll
do is they'll go, okay,

199
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,480
they'll shut you down,
put you in a little box,

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,730
toss you off to the side

201
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,170
and then they'll start
working with somebody

202
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,002
that can help them

203
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:22,340
and two they'll bypass
you and do it anyway.

204
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,910
So in order to make sure
that your organizations

205
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,760
can live within an acceptable risk,

206
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,670
you need to actually get out,

207
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,459
develop relationships
with your business units,

208
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,710
not at the worker level

209
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,800
but the people that
actually run those units,

210
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,209
get up and say, hey, listen,

211
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,090
my job is to make sure
that you're successful

212
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,977
within the risk profile
of the organization.

213
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,180
What are you doing?

214
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,780
What is your plan for the next year?

215
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,790
What are you thinking
about doing with regards

216
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,810
to business development?

217
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,469
When do you have
applications you're looking?

218
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,630
How's the business landscape changing?

219
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,290
Starting to ask those
questions in right of

220
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,300
how are our methodologies
and how you need to change

221
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,599
how you think about your role.

222
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,100
You approach this from a business

223
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,900
and it's like I said,
get out of the office.

224
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,340
It's all about the business,
no ifs, no ands, no buts.

225
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,287
It is about making sure that

226
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,930
you're talking to your organizations,

227
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,719
that you're visiting
with your organization,

228
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,937
that you become a business peer.

229
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,263
And ways to do that are,

230
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,210
again it's kind of hard to do now

231
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,450
because we're all working from home

232
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,820
and some of us look at it
as being trapped at home.

233
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,680
But neither here, nor there,
you have to figure out a way

234
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,849
that gets you out of your comfort zone.

235
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,420
They are, start reading
and doing research on

236
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,449
and taking some courses.

237
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,270
There are lots of good
online courses like that,

238
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,449
business enablement, business strategy,

239
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,900
so you can start learning
the language of business

240
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,370
and not technology,

241
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,900
and then backing in to
that business acumen

242
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,790
and that business understanding,
into cybersecurity

243
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,420
and how you're going
to apply cybersecurity

244
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,459
to enable your businesses to evolve.

245
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,930
And that means doing things like

246
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,209
actually going out and
understanding in depth,

247
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,880
how your business actually
runs, how you're busy.

248
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,580
'Cause a lot of us are in
control of organizations

249
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,080
that have multiple business units.

250
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,229
We have a lot of organizations that,

251
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,250
like a good example would
be like a pharmaceutical.

252
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,750
Not only do you have somebody
that's doing R and D,

253
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,740
you have somebody that's
doing manufacturing,

254
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,590
you have somebody who's
doing distribution,

255
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,730
you have somebody that's doing
distribution and logistics.

256
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,880
You have your enterprise backend systems,

257
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,130
your sasses, your workdays, your HR folks,

258
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,285
your finance folks.

259
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:53,079
You need to understand exactly how

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,940
each one of those organizations
does what it does.

261
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,060
Now, we're not saying
you have to be experts

262
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,348
and you don't have to be,

263
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:05,730
know all the nuances I'm
talking at a macro level,

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,580
not a micro level.

265
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,750
I don't think anybody
would expect you to know

266
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,967
how to file financial reports
or anything like that.

267
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,449
And if we did, that would be kind of scary

268
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,450
because we're not exactly
financial experts,

269
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,040
although you need to understand
a, how the process works,

270
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,230
where they develop the numbers

271
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,670
and be able to develop
that final financial report

272
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,880
at the end of the year,

273
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,650
that you report out either to the street

274
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,140
or your board of directors.

275
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,990
The same thing goes with manufacturing.

276
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,710
How do they decide what products or base

277
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,530
are being developed?

278
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,110
Where do they get their supply
chain for manufacturing?

279
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,240
If they need to develop a new plan,

280
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,520
where does all that come from?

281
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Where does that happen?

282
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,360
How does all of that happen?

283
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,920
And you're not at the micro level,

284
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,140
rather but at the macro level.

285
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,600
Understand the big picture,
understand their strategies,

286
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,060
what are they planning?

287
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,660
And not just this year, but the out year

288
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,010
so you can be able to position yourselves

289
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,390
to be able to put the
tools and technologies

290
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,050
and adjust your architecture

291
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,949
'cause you're gonna have
to adjust your architecture

292
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,630
and your policies and your procedures

293
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,240
to be able to support that.

294
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,968
So what we're really talking about

295
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:21,880
at the end of the day really
is a long roundabout way

296
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,140
of basically changing the way
that you look at your role

297
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,100
from being a technology role,

298
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,330
to being in business enabled role.

299
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,833
And that means that, and I'm not talking,

300
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,983
you don't have to boil
the ocean to do this.

301
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,439
General Abrams, basically
according to terms,

302
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,410
how do you eat an elephant?

303
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,053
You start one bite at a time,
and this is the same way.

304
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,820
I don't expect you to
basically change overnight

305
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,080
and neither does your business.

306
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,150
However, what you should do

307
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,069
is make kinda this into
small manageable chunks,

308
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,070
pick a vertical, pick a business unit

309
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,960
and say, hey, listen,

310
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,800
this is what we're going to do for you

311
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,530
with regards to how we're
changing our approach to security.

312
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,050
The secondary part of that

313
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,229
is that the same time
you need to bifurcate

314
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,370
that you need to start
communicating with your board.

315
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,280
Now, a lot of organizations
don't allow the CISOs

316
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,819
to talk directly to the board.

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,120
Now you may be involved in
generally in the risk committee

318
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,940
or you may be involved, now
that is starting to evolve

319
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,210
and we're seeing a little bit more,

320
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,240
but there are still a lot of organizations

321
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,790
that are very reticent to allow the CISOs

322
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,079
to talk directly to the board

323
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,100
and that's because they viewed,

324
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,430
they think that either
the CISO doesn't know

325
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,709
how to speak the language
that the business understands

326
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,710
and B, that they're going to
be spouting technology jobs,

327
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,010
which will just turn the board off.

328
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,710
You need to learn how to talk

329
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,080
and speak in terms that
the business understands.

330
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,340
So that leads us to
our conversation around

331
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,070
our favorite topic, which is KPIs,

332
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,420
Key Performance Indicators.

333
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,130
Now, I don't have a slide on this,

334
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,680
but we're gonna talk about this

335
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,372
'cause oftentimes the
way that we report out

336
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:18,373
what we're doing is impacting
how we do what we do.

337
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,880
Oftentimes you'll see CISOs,

338
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,340
we'll go up and they'll report,

339
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,970
okay, we blocked this many viruses.

340
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,250
There were this many attacks,

341
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,260
we responded to this many incidents,

342
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,210
we provided this amount of training.

343
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,817
We provided that and that and that

344
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,740
and this and on and on and on

345
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,740
and it's just a (mumbles)
series of technical blurbs

346
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,730
that had no bearing on what you're doing

347
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,090
to provide value for the business.

348
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,730
So you need to start
thinking and evaluating

349
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,200
how you're going to change
how you talk about what you do

350
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,973
to be able to demonstrate
that business value.

351
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,280
So instead of saying, oh we
blocked this number of attacks,

352
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,670
we basically usually change that to okay,

353
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,650
we had this number of incidents

354
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,060
and these typically the average
cost for an incident is X.

355
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,489
So because we blocked
this number of events,

356
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,080
we now have a cost avoidance of Y,

357
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,680
and we spent this much to do that,

358
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,829
so therefore the cost
avoidance for this is tax.

359
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,694
So you have the ability to provide

360
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:26,380
something that is
tangible for the business

361
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,220
to understand which is
the answer up there,

362
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,790
businesses understand money,
they understand revenue,

363
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,719
they understand cost avoidance.

364
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,710
Start looking at how you do

365
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:40,160
and how you come up with your
KPIs and try and think of it,

366
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,189
how the business is hearing those KPIs

367
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,420
and changing your methodology
for delivering them

368
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,709
and for communicating them into language

369
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,520
that these guys can understand.

370
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,150
And I say, these guys,
those girls as well.

371
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,720
But these folks can understand

372
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,260
because they don't know
your business like you do.

373
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,819
And oftentimes each business
has its own language.

374
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,050
Of course we all have ours,

375
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,430
I mean, how many board
members do you know,

376
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,390
who would understand your TTPs

377
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,520
or the kill chain or whatever.

378
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,250
You need to start looking at
how you change your language

379
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,950
as well as how you talk
to these to the folks

380
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,089
about a dead existing business

381
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,980
and use terms that they understand.

382
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,923
And it's gonna be difficult

383
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:27,960
because you're gonna have to
learn an entire new language.

384
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm still learning every day.

385
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,649
I mean, there's some stuff like,

386
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,590
that I bought the other
day, I asked a question,

387
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,709
and then I was like, what are MDOs?

388
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,960
Which is Market Driven Objectives.

389
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm like, oh, that makes sense, okay.

390
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,650
I'd never heard that term before.

391
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,810
Don't be afraid to ask if
you don't know the answer

392
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,879
because going forward an
accurate understanding

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,930
or an incorrect definition of a term

394
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,540
could cause you problems
later on down the road.

395
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,340
So, but having said
that, that doesn't mean

396
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,236
you don't have that interaction.

397
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,753
You don't be mute,

398
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,169
you're gonna have to be a
little bit more out there

399
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,940
with regards to how you
approach talking to folks.

400
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,270
But again, it's about learning,

401
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,889
learning the language,
learning the business,

402
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,490
understanding what they're
doing and how they're doing it

403
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,480
and how what your little cog

404
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,373
is in the giant wheel of
your organization's revenue,

405
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,620
driving and the revenue
protecting mechanism,

406
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,330
where do you fit in all that?

407
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,090
How you can enable that in the most,

408
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,820
and drive down risk for the organization,

409
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,139
at the same time drive value

410
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,290
and proceeded business
as a business value?

411
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:52,280
So a little bit of going forward stuff,

412
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,250
next week, next month and six months.

413
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,230
Next week, make it a point
to set up recurring meetings

414
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,930
and discussion and learning sessions

415
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,020
with your business leaders.

416
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,770
That is incredibly important.

417
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,550
That one A, develops that
relationship with them

418
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,940
and B, they then become
your business mentors.

419
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,720
That gives you the ability to like,

420
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,250
if you're embarrassed
to ask a question about,

421
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,390
'cause you don't know something
and you can go to them

422
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,790
on the back and then say hey, listen,

423
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,810
I don't understand this
concept, explain it to me.

424
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,909
Never be afraid to ask a question

425
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,743
because one,

426
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,169
it shows more that you're willing

427
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,117
to think about it (mumbles).

428
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,730
And two, it shows you're not so yourself

429
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,717
that you're humble enough
to admit the fact that

430
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:33,440
you don't know everything
and you're willing to learn,

431
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,850
goes a long way with folks

432
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,438
'cause oftentimes as we view ourselves

433
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,030
we're the smartest guys in the room

434
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,230
with regards to technology,
that's often true,

435
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,177
but it's not with regards to business

436
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,827
and that perception can
create problems for you.

437
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,230
Deliver a concrete enablement activities

438
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,400
based on your discussion.

439
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,360
That means as you're talking to them,

440
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,429
give them the stuff that allows them

441
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,860
to be able to do what they need to do

442
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,389
from a business perspective.

443
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,710
Say, okay, listen, okay I heard you,

444
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,470
I understand what you're trying to do,

445
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,340
this is what I'm gonna do for you.

446
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,653
And don't make it six months
out a year out, two years out,

447
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,030
do things for them,

448
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,500
low hanging fruit that makes
their lives better sooner.

449
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,880
Again, we talked about begin
thinking about your new KPIs,

450
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,170
what are they gonna be?

451
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,980
Those conversations are gonna drive

452
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,000
what those KPIs are gonna be,

453
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,100
their business value,
KPIs, neck technology KPIs.

454
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,949
Make sure that as you're talking

455
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,850
you keep good notes about what
the business is interested in

456
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,709
and what that vertical is interested in,

457
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,450
so you can deliver KPIs.

458
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,130
So then when it comes time
for budget, you'll see,

459
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,450
you'll be armed with that information

460
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,213
and your business leaders will back you up

461
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:49,629
because you're doing things
to enable their business.

462
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,340
So again, that's trying to
move them from a cost center

463
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,840
into an enablement
center to make sure that

464
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,495
you're providing value to the business.

465
00:20:57,495 --> 00:21:01,790
In six months we're sort
of like the kill chain,

466
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,970
in six, it's a cyclical thing.

467
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,630
Every six months you go back reevaluate.

468
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,110
Say, okay, it's been six months
since we started talking,

469
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,610
what are, how we've been doing?

470
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,443
Are we doing better?

471
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:13,389
Are we doing worse?

472
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,360
Is it improving?

473
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,199
What else do we need to do?

474
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,120
That means basically
starting to use the KPIs

475
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,770
that you initially came up with

476
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,950
are they the right KPIs or
do you need to adjust them?

477
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,730
Then rinse and repeat,

478
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,363
that means start all over
at the beginning, okay?

479
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,840
Because most organizations
begin their planning cycle,

480
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,673
six months into the year.

481
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,667
They're starting to
plan for the next years

482
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:38,500
and then at the end of the year,

483
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,720
they're starting to apply
them for Q three, Q four.

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,880
So there's always this foot in two camps

485
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,210
from a timing perspective

486
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,900
that what you're doing now is
supporting short term goals.

487
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,140
And what you wanna do is also put in place

488
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
because you need the time to plan as well

489
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,970
and you need time to be
able to ask for budget

490
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,750
to build things as well.

491
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,031
So that means essentially developing that

492
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:05,310
cyclical mentality methodology

493
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,710
whereby not only you've got one eye

494
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,580
looking for the 18 to 24 months

495
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,210
but you've got another that other eye,

496
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,920
what are the six month
incremental deliverables

497
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,480
that I'm putting in place

498
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,330
to be able to make my business
function more smoothly,

499
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,970
especially in the environment
in which we are now

500
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,593
because this is not going away.

501
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,950
And the things that you can
do to be able to enable that

502
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,580
are gonna be incredibly important to you.

503
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,300
There's lots of stuff on gardener,

504
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,320
there's lots of stuff on
the organization's websites,

505
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
RSA has a great deal of information,

506
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,500
a huge amount of a library of information

507
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,330
that gives you some tools
to be able to help you

508
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,689
start to plan for the
environment that we are in today.

509
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,090
So going forward,

510
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,459
you need to change how
you perceive yourself

511
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,140
and your role within your organization.

512
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,670
That means you that will
have a direct impact.

513
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,220
If you don't think any
different about yourself,

514
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,630
your organization's not gonna
think any different about you

515
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,530
because thinking of changing your mindset,

516
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,360
there was the old ads the that came around

517
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,830
change something about yourself.

518
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,310
Like move your watch from
one wrist to the next.

519
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:18,310
It actually drives that change
in mindset to where you are,

520
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,930
making sure that you're
starting to make yourself

521
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,633
just a little uncomfortable
because that's important.

522
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,429
Change is not an easy thing.

523
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,070
So you have to make yourself
a little bit uncomfortable,

524
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,189
that little niggly thing

525
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,000
that makes you think
about it all the time,

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,330
a daily reminder, go talk to this person.

527
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,399
Again, how you think
about what your role is,

528
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,163
has a direct impact on how
your organization views you.

529
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,430
You're gonna have to learn the ropes

530
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,500
and new ways you're gonna
have to start from ground zero

531
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,220
'cause I can guarantee a lot of us

532
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,253
because we got a lot of jobs,

533
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:54,260
because we were good technologists,

534
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,290
have very little or at least
a cursory understanding

535
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,129
of how our businesses do what they do

536
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,430
in order to protect and drive revenue.

537
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,200
So you're gonna have to
learn a little language.

538
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,030
You're gonna have to learn new processes,

539
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,200
not at the micro level,
but at the macro level.

540
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,370
Get out, talk to these guys,
it's gonna be difficult.

541
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,989
It's it's gonna be frankly,
a pain in the ass sometimes.

542
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,100
And you think, why would they,

543
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,933
'cause you're always going to think that,

544
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,960
you could be doing this much better.

545
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,430
That'll come later when
you become that value add

546
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,350
when they you've become that trusted voice

547
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,830
or that trusted advisor,

548
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,560
they're going to start listening
to you on you on things

549
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,000
not in just relation to
technology and cybersecurity

550
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,310
and reducing risk,

551
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,663
but since you're a business
enablement partner,

552
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:44,040
they're gonna start listening
to you in other ways as well.

553
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,360
And that's only good for you because

554
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,399
as you mature into your role

555
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,730
and into the new way
your role is going to be,

556
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,370
that's gonna make you more valuable

557
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,713
and more marketable for your next role.

558
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,950
The other part of this is
from always ask yourself,

559
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,050
what you're going to do is,

560
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,899
and what am I going to do?

561
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,770
What if I do A, B, C or D,

562
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,690
is that gonna help, hurt

563
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,880
or have no impact on your
business and its goals?

564
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,850
That is literally the
most important question

565
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,810
that you can ask yourself
in this entire process,

566
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,820
is what I'm planning on doing

567
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,149
from a cyber security perspective,

568
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,750
is it gonna help hurt or be
neutral to my organization.

569
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,750
So that's incredibly important
set of questions to ask.

570
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,207
So whenever you guys come up and

571
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:38,710
we all came up primarily the same way

572
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,630
it's having all these really cool pull.

573
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,100
I've never been a security
guy that didn't like a tool.

574
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,929
Now that's why we have
the complex environments

575
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,440
that we have.

576
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,700
But ask yourself is doing
something like this,

577
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,240
implementing this tool,
changing this control,

578
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,970
what is that gonna do to my business?

579
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,830
Is it gonna help them?

580
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,929
Is it gonna hurt them or is
it going to hold neutral?

581
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,220
So the thing that you
need to remember most is

582
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,200
cyber security is no longer
a technology problem.

583
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,540
It's not, it's a business problem

584
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,520
and that problem can be used to add value,

585
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,750
to help your organizations
protect and grow revenue.

586
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,610
The whole goal of the way
you need to think about this

587
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,689
is not being as technology professional,

588
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,210
but you're a business professional,

589
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,770
cyber security is a business problem.

590
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,350
You need to think about that
role, your role in that life.

591
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,350
So a long winded explanation
that basically says,

592
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,750
hey, listen, take off your
blinders, take off your hat,

593
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,700
start looking at your organizations

594
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,628
and becoming a business enabler,

595
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:44,610
becoming that business partner.

596
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,540
You just happen to have a
different line of business

597
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,560
that contributes to the bottom line.

598
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,899
So thank you all.

599
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,700
If you have any questions,

600
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,000
feel free to pop them into the chat.

601
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,180
This is a little bit pre
recorded, but I'll be online.

602
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,620
So make sure you reach
out and have questions,

603
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,500
type them in there,
we'll get them answered.

604
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,915
Again, you can reach out
to me directly if you wish.

605
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,220
I live on the East coast
in the United States.

606
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,240
So the time zone may
be a little different,

607
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,810
but my email is horrifyingly enough,

608
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,530
slowe@zscaler.com and
you can get me that way.

609
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,100
So thank you all, I appreciate it.

610
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,810
Everybody have a great rest of the day.

611
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,649
Enjoy the rest of this event.

612
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,130
I know it's unusual,

613
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,680
but I think it's pretty cool

614
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,730
that we're still able to have this

615
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,440
in the environment that we're in.

616
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,343
And I think hopefully
everybody enjoyed today's talk.
