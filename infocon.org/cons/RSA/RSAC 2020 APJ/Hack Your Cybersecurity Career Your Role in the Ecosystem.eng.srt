1
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,766
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,200
- Hello, and welcome to hack
your cybersecurity career,

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,360
your role in the ecosystem.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
If you're joining us live

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,380
our speakers are in the Slido
discussion area right now,

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,040

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,860
I am now pleased to turn it over to

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,913
Caroline Wong for her presentation.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,843
- Thank you, Brenda.

12
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,510
Hi, my name is Caroline Wong

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,550
and I am the chief strategy
officer at Cobalt.io.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,910
A pentest as a service company.

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,060
Thank you for joining
me today for discussion

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,230
about hacking your cybersecurity career

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,453
and your role in the ecosystem.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,179
Cybersecurity is at the same time,

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,210
infinitely complex,

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,360
and also fundamentally simple.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,010
Just like any other business process,

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,270
it requires a combination of
people, process and technology

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,550
to achieve optimal results.

24
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,770
I firmly believe that the most
important of these components

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,633
is people.

26
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,920
In this talk I'll share
tips and techniques

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,030
that any professional or
enthusiast can use to enhance his

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,420
or her cybersecurity career.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,640
I'll also talk about our
responsibility to each other

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,813
as an ecosystem of the
world's Digital Defenders,

31
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,040
as Brendah mentioned,

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm on chat and I look forward
to discussing these topics

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,243
with you throughout the session today.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,540
Why does cybersecurity
matter in the first place?

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,100
It's because the internet
was never intended to do

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,183
what it does today.

37
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,560
In 1969, all university computers at

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,320
UCLA, Stanford, UCSP and
the university of Utah

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,430
were connected by ARPANET,

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,300
a project started by the

41
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,670
Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

42
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,570
In 1985, the National Science Foundation

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,560
established NSFNET,

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
a network of scientific
computers that serve scientists,

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
researchers and engineers

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,380
who work for the National
center for Atmospheric Research.

47
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,480
These people studied the atmosphere

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,783
and its interactions with
the oceans land and sun.

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,769
A decade later,

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,763
the internet was being used to
support electronic commerce.

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,000
During a 1998, U.S. Senate testimonial,

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,540
a group of security researchers explained

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,660
that the internet was not designed for it.

54
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,000
They described the academic
and scientific objectives

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,260
of getting computers to
talk to each other, quote

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,450
It grew up, it flourished, it
struck everybody by surprise

57
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,109
and now big business is saying,

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,640
well, let's jump on board and
make some money off of this.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,380
Well, this is kind of like
if you've driven in Boston,

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,240
the streets aren't tremendously designed

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,510
in a wonderful fashion

62
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,230
because they follow the cows around

63
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,060
and lay the pavement down.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,860
I mean, you can get it to work,

65
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,523
but it can be really painful.

66
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,730
In 2003, the first version of
the OWASP top 10 was published

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,210
and in 2011,

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,027
Mark Andreessen wrote,
"software is eating the world."

69
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,783
So here we are,

70
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,829
cybersecurity is a problem

71
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,200
because we use the internet for
things it was never designed

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,769
to accommodate

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,230
and so many things depend on software.

74
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,350
When value shifts

75
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,320
from the physical world
to the digital world,

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,720
protecting that value has to shift too

77
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,150
Today, there is tremendous
demand for Cybersecurity talent

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,653
and not enough supply.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,110
The latest ISC squared Cyber
Security Workforce study,

80
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,850
states that the Workforce
Gap has increased again,

81
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,990
primarily due to a global
surge in hiring demand

82
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,550
using the Workforce
estimate of 2.8 million

83
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,920
based on the 11 economies

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,260
for which ISC squared
provided a workforce estimate

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,539
and the global gap
estimate of 4.07 million,

86
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,950
ISC squared estimates

87
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,950
that the global workforce
actually needs to grow by 145%.

88
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,349
In the 2019 study, 65% of
organizations represented,

89
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,820
have a shortage of staff
dedicated to cybersecurity

90
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,080
and a lack of skilled and experienced

91
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,020
Cybersecurity personnel,

92
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,043
is the top concern among
survey respondents.

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,299
The thing is, that just like
any other business initiative,

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,820
a successful applicant,

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,610
a successful cybersecurity program needs

96
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,533
the right balance of people,
process and technology.

97
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,323
Tools are useful, but no
tool is a silver bullet.

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,860
Any type of Cybersecurity
technology still requires people

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,203
in the right workflows to be effective.

100
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,220
I want to talk for a moment

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,570
about why unfortunately, all
of our Cybersecurity problems

102
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,453
can't simply be solved using technology.

103
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,540
The thing is that
computers are really good

104
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,763
at doing exactly what you tell them to do.

105
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,040
They're not so good at thinking creatively

106
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,723
or applying business logic.

107
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,590
Even the most sophisticated
machine learning techniques

108
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,419
are still vulnerable to concept drift,

109
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,140
the idea that machine
learning predictions are made,

110
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,370
by using pattern matching on old data.

111
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,930
The old data never exactly
matches the new data,

112
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,383
so the predictions can
never be exactly right.

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,170
To me this is sort of obvious,

114
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,800
if somebody built a machine

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,390
that could accurately predict the future,

116
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,169
that would be awesome.

117
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,343
To my knowledge, this
doesn't exist quite yet.

118
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,800
I want to share an analogy

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,830
that has to do with using a machine

120
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,010
to correct spelling errors.

121
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,230
Let's talk about a spellchecker.

122
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,973
Spellchecker can be extremely useful,

123
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,023
but it's not perfect.

124
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,830
Look over there at the
drawing on the whiteboard.

125
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,780
They're ideas are articulated nicely.

126
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,669
There going to take a picture and share it

127
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,970
with the rest of the team.

128
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,840
A computer program sees nothing wrong

129
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,830
with the spelling of these words,

130
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,919
but a human does.

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,160
Similarly when it comes to something like

132
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,240
finding security
vulnerabilities in software,

133
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,273
computers can't find everything.

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,130
Only humans can find business logic flaws

135
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,190
and these are often some
of the most interesting

136
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,203
and most severe security
vulnerabilities that there are.

137
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,087
In his 2011, OWASP Presentation called

138
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,310
"How to prevent business loss,

139
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,860
vulnerabilities in Web Applications,"

140
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,030
Margo Morano highlights

141
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,570
password reef, user flaws,
username, recovery flaws,

142
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,770
and following eCommerce
business logic attacks

143
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,969
altering the price of
an item before checkout

144
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,023
and bypassing payment validation
before shipping an item.

145
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,169
It would be super convenient,

146
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,960
if you could just buy
a piece of technology

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,609
that would do everything for you,

148
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,260
unfortunately, standards and
firewalls cancel everything.

149
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,010
Their effectiveness is
directly related to the skills

150
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,353
and manual effort of
people who must turn them

151
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:54,690
through a specific environment,

152
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,250
monitor them regularly

153
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,623
and filter the signal from the noise.

154
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,104
I want to tell you about
a research project.

155
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:06,240
My friend, Vanessa and I wrote,

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,963
my friend and colleague
Vanessa's daughter and I,

157
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,380
we publish it recently

158
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,457
and it's called "The
State of Pentesting 2020."

159
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,300
Vanessa and I work together at Cobalt.io,

160
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,540
a Pentest as a service company.

161
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,490
And during the last four years at Cobalt,

162
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,610
we've conducted more than 2,500 Pentests

163
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,283
through our P task platform.

164
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,940
This report features
insights from aggregated data

165
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,093
derived from nearly 1200
Pentests conducted in 2019.

166
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,820
We also analyze survey responses

167
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,020
from more than 100 practitioners in

168
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,660
security, development,
operations and product roles

169
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,610
regarding their security programs.

170
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,530
Respondents spanned a wide
variety of industries,

171
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,689
including information technology,
healthcare, education,

172
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,953
retail and finance.

173
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,410
Finally the report includes insights

174
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,699
to members of the Cobalt
co. Pentester community

175
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,130
in partnership with independent
researchers, engineers,

176
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,033
and other security practitioners.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
I think that one of the
most exciting topics

178
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,449
that this report assesses is

179
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,320
which web application
security vulnerabilities

180
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,700
can be found reliably using machines

181
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,570
and which requires human
expertise to manually identify.

182
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,130
The scope of this exploration is

183
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,030
Black Box penetration testing, humans

184
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,020
against dynamic scanning
and out of band testing

185
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,803
machines for web applications.

186
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,890
We investigate the following questions.

187
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,330
Number one, what vulnerability types

188
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,310
can dynamic scanners reliably find?

189
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,609
Number two, what are
the vulnerability types

190
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,810
that only humans can find?

191
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,199
ie dynamic scanners cannot rely,

192
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,060
cannot reliably identify them.

193
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,270
And number three, what are
the vulnerability types

194
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,680
for which standards will not
automatically populate results,

195
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,940
but where automated tools
can enhance efficiency

196
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,373
to conduct further exploitation?

197
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,230
We assume that humans will use proxies

198
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,390
like burp suite, Fiddler or ZAP

199
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,520
to modify HTTP requests
and modify web sessions,

200
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,829
all those sites.

201
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,660
Any tool that can once configured

202
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,219
identify a class of vulnerabilities

203
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,540
will be considered findable by machines.

204
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,490
Note, this does not include
tools like feathers,

205
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,150
where the tool assists
in identifying problems,

206
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,840
but does not necessarily identify

207
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,910
what type of vulnerability is

208
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,252
or how to practically address it.

209
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,130
Our intention is that this
report might help security

210
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,320
and engineering teams

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,550
to make informed decisions

212
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,943
concerning their Cybersecurity programs.

213
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,223
Here are a few key findings.

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,350
Humans win at finding the
following vulnerability types,

215
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,910
business logic bypasses, race conditions

216
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,250
and changed exploits.

217
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,840
Although machines broadly win

218
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,070
at finding most vulnerability
types, when applied correctly.

219
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,580
Scanning results should
be used as guideposts

220
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,382
and analyzed contextually.

221
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,870
There are vulnerabilities that

222
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,220
neither humans nor machines
can independently find

223
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,763
rather must Work together
to identify these issues.

224
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,100
Vulnerability types in
this category include

225
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,170
authorization flaws like
insecure direct object reference,

226
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,599
out of band XML external
entity, SAML XXV injection,

227
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,890
Dom based cross site scripting,
insecurities sterilization

228
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,689
remote code exploitation,
session management,

229
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,353
file upload bugs and sub domain takeovers.

230
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,003
That was kind of a mouthful,

231
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
as the pace of software release hastens

232
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,550
so must the methodology is
designed to secure applications.

233
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,010
More than a third of
our survey respondents

234
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,023
release software on a
weekly or daily cadence.

235
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,410
And here are some of
the concluding takeaways

236
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,242
from the report.

237
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:07,510
First, identifying a
vulnerability is not the same

238
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,280
as assessing the risk that it presents.

239
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,199
Scanners can succeed in
quickly finding vulnerabilities

240
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,940
when properly directed,

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,890
but practitioners are required
to apply necessary context

242
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,730
among the many vulnerabilities,

243
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,100
including false positives you might find.

244
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
The most important process

245
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,090
is finding the true
number of vulnerabilities

246
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,693
and remediating the most critical ones.

247
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,363
Right now only humans
can perform such tasks.

248
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,620
Finally, good Pentesters
rely heavily on automation

249
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,070
to test applications,

250
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,840
whether writing Python code to iterate

251
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,460
through hundreds of sub domains

252
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,150
or automatically fuzzing inputs.

253
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,560
While Pentesters will automate
many of their processes

254
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,199
to maximize their own efficiency,

255
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,780
such automation is not
synonymous with scanning.

256
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,040
Scripts are often written to problem solve

257
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,250
and make the pentesting experience faster

258
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,160
and more rewarding.

259
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,610
In fact, the tools that
pentesters develop and rely on

260
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,630
to conduct security assessments

261
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,100
reflect human creativity,

262
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,713
persistence, and out of the box thinking.

263
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,560
In addition to evaluating,

264
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,109
nearly 1200 pentests conducted in 2019

265
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,160
and assessing the relative
capability of machines and humans

266
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,439
to find different kinds of

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,930
Web Applications security vulnerabilities.

268
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,540
We also analyzed survey responses

269
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,620
from more than 100 practitioners

270
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,620
in security, development,
operations and product roles

271
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,920
regarding their application
security programs.

272
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,090
Here's what we learned,

273
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,590
52% indicate that their
organizations pentest applications,

274
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,310
at least quarterly,

275
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,083
well only 16% pentest
annually or biannually.

276
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,790
54% of organizations use

277
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,740
an agile software development methodology

278
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,770
and 30% characterize the
methodology as Dev Ops

279
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,063
compared to just 5% doing waterfall.

280
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,819
25% of organizations released
software on a daily basis,

281
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,370
12% released software weekly,

282
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,490
22% released software monthly

283
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,220
and 13% release software quarterly.

284
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Only 1% of respondents reported
that their organizations

285
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,303
release software annually.

286
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,750
We found out that organizations pentest

287
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,140
many different types of applications

288
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,300
while application pentesting
continues to be most popular,

289
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,632
API cloud and mobile testing fair well.

290
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
Cloud environments continue
to present significant risk,

291
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,773
particularly with regards to
security misconfiguration,

292
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,730
more than half 51% of survey respondents

293
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,653
conduct pentesting on Amazon
based cloud environments alone,

294
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,480
almost three quarters, 71% also said

295
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,310
that they rely on cloud environments

296
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,262
like Amazon web services
or Microsoft Azure.

297
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,280
Many organizations are making
the transition from Dev Ops

298
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,780
to Dev Sec Ops

299
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,370
and embracing an everyone
is part of the security team

300
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,683
approach to security.

301
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,390
The majority of respondents, 78%,

302
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,199
reported a strong relationship

303
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,140
between security and engineering

304
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,189
and we expect that to grow in the future.

305
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,660
The last thing I'll share
with you about the report,

306
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,079
which I encourage you to look up and read.

307
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,090
Scanners can only be as effective

308
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,620
as the practitioners who deploy them.

309
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,690
Open source and enterprise scanners

310
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,650
serve as an excellent baseline

311
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,920
to reliably identify simpler
classes of vulnerabilities.

312
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,689
When configured correctly,

313
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,790
they can save a tremendous amount of time.

314
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,480
All Cybersecurity programs,

315
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,050
all applications security programs,

316
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,949
no matter how scrappy or robust

317
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,783
should use static and dynamic testing.

318
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,449
Standards however, are
not a substitute for

319
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,140
comprehensive application
security measures,

320
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,257
nor can they replace pentesting

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay, the internet wasn't
built with security in mind,

322
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,400
the world has a massive talent shortage,

323
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,760
and we can't rely on
automation to solve everything.

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,290
I'd like to switch gears
and explore what's happening

325
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,463
to the people in this scenario.

326
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,010
I want to talk about the
culture of cybersecurity teams.

327
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,300
Throughout my 15 years as a
cybersecurity professional,

328
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
I've worked on many different
cyber security teams

329
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,730
and interacted with dozens,

330
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,310
maybe even hundreds of different teams

331
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,410
by this point in time.

332
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,469
Today in my role as Chief
Strategy Officer at Cobalt,

333
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,280
I oversee both cybersecurity
and people, human resources.

334
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,770
It's fair for me to say that

335
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,933
I am totally obsessed with culture.

336
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,890
There's a book that I like a lot

337
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,859
on the topic of culture
written by a person named

338
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,479
Daniel Coyle, Coyle says,

339
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,640
culture is a set of living relationships

340
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,210
working toward a shared goal.

341
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,119
It's not something you are,

342
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,219
it's something you do.

343
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,500
I certainly think this applies
to cybersecurity themes.

344
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,290
What do you think?

345
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,983
I'd love to hear what
you're thinking in the chat.

346
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,659
One type of cybersecurity team culture

347
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,450
is the checklist driven kind.

348
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,610
These kinds of teams may see
cybersecurity as a set of tasks

349
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,023
to track and complete.

350
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,860
Maybe they're driven by compliance audits

351
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,240
or customer contracts.

352
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,620
There might be a lot of paper work

353
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,429
and documentation involved

354
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,740
and maybe this type of
culture is very policy

355
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,123
and process driven.

356
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,910
In some cases,
checklist-driven security teams

357
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,420
might have a blind spot

358
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,480
when it comes to assessing
and managing risk

359
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,090
that's beyond the scope of
whatever list they're using

360
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,592
to drive their activity.

361
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,200
Another type of cybersecurity team culture

362
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,723
is driven by an engineering mentality.

363
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,170
Occasionally these folks
might get technology happy,

364
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,770
obsessing over an interesting
solution to a problem

365
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,293
before that problem is
even clearly defined.

366
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,659
These types of teams might talk a lot

367
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,000
about the value of automation,

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
but experience challenges

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,880
when it comes to getting things done

370
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,333
and over the finish line,

371
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,310
in some cases, engineering

372
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,530
or technology driven security teams

373
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,139
might have a blind spot

374
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,430
when it comes to assessing
and managing risk

375
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,440
that's beyond whatever
shiny flashing object

376
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,060
they're focused on in any given moment.

377
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,990
They may also have
challenges with communicating

378
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,653
to cross functional teams
and executive leadership.

379
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,270
Yet another type of
cybersecurity team culture

380
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,693
is driven by money.

381
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,320
Another less flattering view

382
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,790
might be to say the team culture

383
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,023
is driven by office
politics or even greed.

384
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,740
Sometimes this happens when
an organization finds itself

385
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,640
on a wildly successful trajectory

386
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,000
in a very short amount of time,

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,590
naturally cybersecurity
attacks are going to occur

388
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,980
and the executive team is likely
to invest in cybersecurity

389
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,093
in order to address these concerns.

390
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,770
Security team members may be hired

391
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,150
based on their reputations
or personal brand

392
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,670
rather than their practical experience

393
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,553
and ability to contribute
value immediately.

394
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,139
In some cases, money
driven cybersecurity teams

395
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,690
might find themselves bickering

396
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,090
with cross functional teams and reacting

397
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,370
to executive personalities

398
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,053
rather than objectively
assessing and managing risk.

399
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:02,490
I think the most effective
cybersecurity teams

400
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,310
have a culture of collaboration.

401
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,899
In this model, the security
team aims to listen, learn,

402
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,210
and really understand what's
valuable to the organization.

403
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,810
Security teams partner with technologists

404
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,620
and business leaders to define
the path forward together

405
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,183
with common goals and objectives in mind.

406
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,873
Do any of those culture
descriptions resonate with you?

407
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,322
If so, which one?

408
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,703
I'd love to hear about it in the chat.

409
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,510
Next week you might consider evaluating

410
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,120
what are the factors that inspire you

411
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,693
and drive you to succeed?

412
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,333
Consider that,

413
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,879
well, maybe right now, because
we've just gone over these

414
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,680
like handful of different culture types,

415
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,000
maybe you're thinking about

416
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,193
what type of culture your
cybersecurity team has.

417
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,530
Next week, I'll encourage you
to take that one step further

418
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,990
and consider what type of culture

419
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,653
you'd actually prefer to be on.

420
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,959
Maybe you're perfectly
satisfied with the team culture

421
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,410
that you're currently on,

422
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,000
or maybe you're not,

423
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,800
either way I think it's an
interesting thought exercise.

424
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,440
In the next three months,

425
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,890
I recommend that you make
three new connections

426
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,320
with technology or business
leaders at your organization,

427
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,639
not cybersecurity leaders,

428
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,380
ask them what they do

429
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,560
and what their goals are
for the rest of this year

430
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,733
and for 2021,

431
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,480
if in the course of your
conversation with them,

432
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,100
you learn about a new
business initiative technology

433
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,060
or business process,

434
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,340
take the time to learn more

435
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,760
and analyze what security implications

436
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,160
this new thing might have
for your organization.

437
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,850
And the next six months,

438
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,669
I recommend that you
find three job postings

439
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,880
that align with your interests.

440
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,750
You don't have to be
actively job searching

441
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,363
in order to do this exercise,

442
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,490
take a step back, zoom out and
think about the big picture.

443
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,060
What do you wanna be doing?

444
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,473
in your 2025,

445
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,460
make three new connections
outside of your organization

446
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,383
that can help you network
and get to that new place.

447
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,450
Maybe it's someone you meet
at this virtual conference.

448
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,720
Look, the person up,

449
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,650
read, or watch one or more
things the person has written

450
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,820
or recorded and write to
them about what you think,

451
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,600
ask them to connect with you

452
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,312
and see if you can start
an ongoing conversation.

453
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,940
And finally, if you are
able to find three or so

454
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,900
job descriptions that you
think might be really fun to do

455
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,120
a handful of years from now,

456
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,600
look at the requirements and
skillsets that are required

457
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,610
and if you don't have them,

458
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,649
see if maybe you can find some
opportunities for learning

459
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,230
that you can add to your skillset

460
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,460
and experience over the next five years

461
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,883
to propel you further.

462
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,040
It has been my absolute
pleasure to speak with you

463
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,550
and be chatting with
you, let's keep it up.

464
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,000
I've got here on this slide,

465
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,510
a few different ways that
we can stay connected

466
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,240
even after the conference

467
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,670
and I look forward to
speaking with you in the chat.

468
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,170
Thank you so much for
spending time with me today.
