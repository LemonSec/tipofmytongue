00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,090
- So hi, my name is Jaromir.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,630
I work in Trend Micro as
a cyber threat researcher

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,200
and my topic is called cyberespionage

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,430
abusing third-party cloud
services in targeted attacks.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,680
So what will be my presentation about?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,250
So basically when you are dealing with

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,160
malware infrastructure and
communication protocols,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,780
you can have two different approaches.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,710
You can have either the custom approach

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,150
or a cloud based approach.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,810
In case of custom approach,
the threat actors themselves

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,169
register their own
domains, their own hosting,

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,490
they write their own backend scripts,

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,910
design communication protocols.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,269
In case of cloud based,
they abuse some kind of

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,800
legitimate cloud services.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,140
What are these cloud services?

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,840
So this overview shows you
which services might be abused.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,850
They are renowned
services for file sharing,

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,140
text storage, communication
collaboration services,

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,410
version controlling
services, and many others.

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,279
So in my presentation I will look

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,460
at four different APT groups

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,610
which I helped to research in the past.

25
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,820
From each group I choose one or two

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,099
of their backdoors or file-stealing tools

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,530
and I will analyze them for you.

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,040
I will show you which services

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,300
have been abused and how and what it means

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,500
for us researchers, what advantages,

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,114
disadvantages and what benefits
this can provide to us.

32
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:21,170
So if you like this topic,

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,003
Thank you.
