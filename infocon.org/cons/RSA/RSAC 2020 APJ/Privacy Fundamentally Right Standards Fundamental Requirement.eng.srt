I'd now like to turn it
over to Laura Lindsay

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,680
and John Britton for the presentation.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,492
- Thank you, Ally.

15
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,540
My name is John Britton, I'm with Google,

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,850
I'm part of the standards and
engineering compliance group.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,300
I've been working on standards

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,929
for just about three years now.

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,030
And my first real entry into standards

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,980
was helping develop with
Laura, this 27701 standard

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,530
that we're going to talk
to you about today, Laura.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,430
- Thanks and I work with Microsoft,

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,010
I work in the corporate
standards group at Microsoft

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,130
that focuses on cybersecurity
and privacy standards.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,929
And in particular we are looking

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,890
at how we can leverage standards

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,380
for looking at all of
the global regulations

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,560
around data protection and privacy,

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,573
which this presentation is based on.

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,473
- So after this session we
hope that you'll be able

31
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,800
to look within your organization

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,160
and determine how it's
impacted by privacy governance.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,340
Identify which privacy governance models

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,070
impact your organization.

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,720
Choose the right privacy governance model

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,750
and then finally we hope that Laura

37
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,800
and I interest you enough in standards

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,610
that you'll wanna participate
within your own country

39
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,493
to help develop in further
international standards.

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,690
So why an ISO Standard?

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,329
So privacy is a challenging topic, right?

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,150
Many countries and a lot of
people think about privacy

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,063
and ask the question is it
a fundamental human right?

44
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,010
And there's many different questions

45
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,233
depending on regions, locations.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,340
The world though is moving
towards looking at privacy

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,900
as a fundamental right.

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,060
There's a variety of
different existing regulations

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,600
from GDPR in Europe to CCPA
in California, Australia,

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,920
Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,859
and many different organizations,

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,650
excuse me not organizations,

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,800
countries have their own look at privacy.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,430
And we believe that by
looking at ISO and 27701,

55
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,720
we can help drive consensus
and build a uniform look

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,113
at how to develop the privacy model.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,670
- Great John and folks if
you look now at this map,

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,959
so why do we think that
privacy is a global viewpoint?

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,910
You can see from the global map

60
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,460
countries around the world

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,930
are initiating some type of privacy

62
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,210
or data protection regulation.

63
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,240
This regulation can be extensive,

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,310
as shown in the map by the red countries,

65
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,050
those countries have extremely strong

66
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,450
or a large number of regulations.

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,579
So if you look at Europe,
you're going to see GDPR,

68
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,470
in China you've got their
data and privacy regulations

69
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,420
that they have.

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,760
The other colors are
representing different levels

71
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,290
of privacy regulations
that are being developed.

72
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,530
And you can see that a
vast part of the world

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,410
is already doing some type of regulation.

74
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,210
Now if you're a small company,

75
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,900
where you are simply
working in a single country,

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,240
it might not seem like
a large problem to you

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,630
that there's you know 50, a
hundred different regulations

78
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,500
that potentially are out
there that you have to meet.

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,030
But if we think about the fact

80
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,060
that we actually work in a global market

81
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,750
and that market means that
people are accessing information

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,880
and accessing maybe products or services

83
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,670
from anywhere around the globe,

84
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,530
then you could end up having to meet

85
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,909
different regulatory requirements.

86
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,130
So you are gonna potentially
be concerned about that.

87
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,730
So what we wanna do is look at

88
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,030
how do we come up with a global solution

89
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,433
for this global market?

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,750
So when we say that,
what we wanna try to do

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,440
is imagine the way that we can meet

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,010
these different requirements.

93
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,130
So each jurisdiction
whether that be Hong Kong,

94
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,090
Australia, Singapore, South Korea,

95
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,890
they all have some different aspect

96
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,590
of what they believe the regulation is.

97
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,679
And when you look at some
of the smaller companies

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,680
that are trying to do
business in these areas.

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
If you have multiple different
types of requirements

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,280
that are required, that you need to meet,

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,690
then it makes it more difficult

102
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,160
to be able to spend the
money that you have to do

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,470
to get the audit to show the
proof that you're doing this.

104
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,790
So we wanna come up with something

105
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,490
that's a little more
global in the solution.

106
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,250
ISO and ISO/IEC standards are
a way to look at doing that,

107
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,800
they are international standards,

108
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,150
they adhere to the World
Trade Organization,

109
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,229
technical barrier to trade
rules, which means that

110
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,100
they help people be able to
do work in different countries

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,140
following the same technical requirements.

112
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,930
And we wanna have something

113
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,680
that's gonna provide some flexibility

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,740
so that as you see these
different regulations,

115
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,080
we can see what is happening

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,219
and how we can put this together.

117
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,920
So when we talk about using ISO

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,500
and we talk about ISO/IEC 27701,

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,590
we're gonna talk about

120
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,630
how this can then be used
to solve this global problem

121
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,840
that we're starting to see
with the many different

122
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,210
and the number of different regulations

123
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,960
that we're starting to see crop up.

124
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,350
So why then this particular
ISO IEC standard?

125
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,360
In other words, why can't we use something

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,780
that already exists?

127
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,260
Or why does it need to
be an ISO/IEC standard?

128
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,240
Or you know what does that really mean?

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,370
Well one of the unique things about this

130
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,480
and I'm gonna say just one item,

131
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,920
'cause a lot of the times
people say ISO or they say IEC,

132
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,910
and you'll notice here I say ISO/IEC.

133
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,400
All this really means
is that it is a standard

134
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,489
that's adopted by both
ISO and IEC together.

135
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,420
So it's not simply an ISO standard,

136
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,540
it's not simply an IEC standard.

137
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,950
So just just to clarify why
we use that terminology.

138
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,930
So why 27701?

139
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,810
So what we did was you wanted
to look at the fact that,

140
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,810
in theory, most people are
familiar with ISO/IEC 27001,

141
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,040
or the Information Security
Management System ISMS.

142
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,600
Now people look at that

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,860
and that's touted as one
of the top tier standards

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,870
and top tier types of
certifications that you can get.

145
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,830
And you would normally think that

146
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,000
that would be sufficient to scope

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,270
and take into account laws and regulations

148
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,780
that are required.

149
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,299
Because part of the
requirements of an ISMS,

150
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,760
is to identify what
regulations and requirements

151
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,180
you need to meet.

152
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,150
However, when we actually start looking

153
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,729
at these data protection and
these privacy regulations,

154
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,600
we realize they're a little
bit more complex than simply

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,670
something that information
security management would cover.

156
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,450
There are things like
understanding how the impact

157
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,670
to an individual actually
impacts what you have to do

158
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,090
from a risk management perspective.

159
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,609
And so rather than just saying,

160
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,790
oh, we're gonna create
something new, we wanna say,

161
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,700
how do we provide what a lot
of people call sector specific

162
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,050
or in this case, a
technology unique situation

163
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,240
specific type of requirement
that's gonna help

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,900
both the consumers that are worried

165
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,460
about data protection and privacy,

166
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,870
as well as the regulators

167
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,460
who are wanting to do
different types of regulations.

168
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,809
How can we do that?

169
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,030
So we went (mumbles) this
might be a way we can do it.

170
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,490
So why does this matter?

171
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,970
Well, it matters because as you
saw from the map previously,

172
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,540
there are a multitude of ways
that people are coming up

173
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,040
with new privacy regulations.

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,209
So rather than trying to have to work

175
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,570
in every single one of them,

176
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,310
if we take the idea or the
concept of a management system

177
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,770
and we apply that to privacy,

178
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,740
then we can have a flexible
way that we can standardize

179
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,050
and create certification mechanism

180
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,839
that will provide for a way

181
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,060
to meet these privacy
regulations without having to go

182
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,829
and do this 50 times or 100 times

183
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,780
in each of the different jurisdictions.

184
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,560
So let's talk a little
bit about what it is then.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,560
So if we say 27701 and we say
okay well what is it really?

186
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,160
How does it really work?

187
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,650
Well part of how it works is that

188
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,920
it takes the concept of
you already have some type

189
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,620
of information security
management system in place.

190
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,160
And part of that information
security management system

191
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,360
requires that you have
to do a risk assessment.

192
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,340
So it's a risk based concept.

193
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,180
So what we wanna do is we
wanna be able to leverage that

194
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,069
and in turn add to it,

195
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,950
the privacy and data
protection requirements

196
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,110
that need to be included,
that also understand

197
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,160
that there's specific
items that are gonna cover

198
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,569
that a data subject would
individual's rights are.

199
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,150
And so we take that
concept and we say okay,

200
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,360
we know we wanna extend what we have

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,940
and then we we look at it and we say,

202
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,980
unlike information security
where there's usually

203
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,210
a security team or you're looking at it

204
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,350
from the organization perspective.

205
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,600
Well when you start talking
about data protection,

206
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,470
you have a couple of different roles

207
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,800
that you see coming up in
a lot of these regulations.

208
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,260
And those roles are, is
somebody a data processor?

209
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,010
Or are they a data controller?

210
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,780
And they have some obligations

211
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,550
that they both have to meet
and there's certain obligations

212
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,689
that if you're a data
processor you need to meet

213
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,770
and certain ones that if
you're a data controller

214
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,850
you need to meet.

215
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,130
So how do I know what
controls I need to implement

216
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,800
if I'm a data processor?

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,650
Well 27701 takes that concept and it says,

218
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,290
we're gonna address how you do that.

219
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,569
So first you're risk based and
now you're gonna look at it,

220
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,840
what role am I playing, so what
controls do I need to pick?

221
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,460
And the last piece which is
where it helps the flexibility

222
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,470
and helps us be able to
look at how we potentially

223
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,060
will use this across
multiple jurisdictions

224
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,949
or with multiple different
regulatory requirements,

225
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,320
is providing the evidence

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,530
that you're actually
meeting those controls.

227
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,720
In other words, how do I
provide evidence to show

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,360
that I'm in compliance?

229
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,580
And so when I've determined
what controls I have,

230
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,910
I now have guidance of what
type of evidence would show

231
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,900
that I'm now meeting that control.

232
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,990
And that's in the implementation guidance,

233
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,940
that's also included in 27701.

234
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
So you get this lovely mapping

235
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,190
of taking these individual steps together,

236
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,170
to be able to produce what is 27701.

237
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,949
Now to give you a better
understanding of how we got here,

238
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,700
John's gonna give us a little
bit of history about 27701

239
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,740
and how it came into be.

240
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,813
John, over to you.

241
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,970
John I think you wanted
to talk not on mute

242
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,660
because we wanna hear about
the history of ISO/IEC 27701.

243
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,079
- I apologize I was on mute, thanks Laura.

244
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,080
So ISO 27701 started, It was presented

245
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,160
by the French delegation
to the ISO community

246
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,770
within SC27, that's a subcommittee 27.

247
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,467
And at the time the
title of ISO SIEC, SC27

248
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,189
was just information security.

249
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,770
We've only recently added the
privacy edition to the name

250
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,872
in the past two years.

251
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,800
It took about three years for
this from birth to publication

252
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,750
rather interesting process
if you're not involved.

253
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,750
So documents presented, new
work item proposals made.

254
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,670
Experts get together they form a draft,

255
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,050
each international company
or excuse me not company,

256
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,040
country then gets together
with their own experts

257
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,780
makes recommendations and
that goes through voting

258
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,839
and that's why it takes
about two to three years

259
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,480
for typical standard to make it

260
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,420
from its inception into publication.

261
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,689
As Laura mentioned, 27701 expands on 27001

262
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,330
to more fully integrate privacy, right.

263
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,330
So 27001 had mentions of
privacy, 27017 expanded on that,

264
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,370
27018 expanded a little more.

265
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,020
It was really time and the French decided

266
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,230
that there really needed to
be a very specific standard

267
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,014
instead of controls on privacy.

268
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,790
And 27701 is that PIMS solution,

269
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,699
so Privacy Information
Management System, right?

270
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,710
And the great thing about
this ISO standard is

271
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,950
that your auditors, if
they're doing the 277,

272
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,250
excuse me the 27001 audit

273
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,250
are familiar with how to audit
on 2700 oh excuse me 27701.

274
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,763
Too many sevens, too many
zeros, too many ones.

275
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,680
But your auditor will allow
you to not have to switch gears

276
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,760
and go find a different auditor.

277
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,550
All of these are ISO, all
the auditors that do 27001

278
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,530
can also implement your 27701 audit.

279
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,290
So hopefully that's a brief history.

280
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,839
Hopefully I've excited you a little bit

281
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,913
about standards, Laura.

282
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,100
- So now looking at this,
so John's talked about

283
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,910
how you can certify to
it and what it means.

284
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,230
So let's talk about how
it all comes together.

285
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,900
So in looking at this diagram,

286
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,233
you can see that we start with 27001,

287
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,633
we add the processor
in controller guidance

288
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,750
that I had mentioned previously,

289
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,230
as well as the privacy
enhancements to 27001.

290
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,230
All of this together
is what creates 27701.

291
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,740
Now that's all well and good
and now we have a standard.

292
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,410
But how do we get to that certification?

293
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,370
How do we make sure that a
certification can be used

294
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,200
and how do those get created?

295
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,930
Well if you look at the
purple box, we say okay,

296
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,930
we now need to understand that
to get a 27701 certification,

297
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,210
you're gonna need to do
a lot of what 27001 does

298
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,570
for its certification as well.

299
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,250
And the way that the ISO system actually

300
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,780
puts this all together is it says,

301
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,270
we're gonna create what
they call a scheme.

302
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,890
In other words, this is a privacy scheme

303
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,380
that they've created based upon 27701.

304
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,189
And the way that they
provide the consistency

305
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,080
for that scheme and how it's audited,

306
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,520
is they actually create another standard,

307
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,370
which they're in the process of doing,

308
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,370
that states what the
requirements of an auditor is,

309
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,260
if they're going to create a certification

310
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,260
and do a certification audit for 27701.

311
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,330
And that particular one

312
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,770
and we know that this is a lot of numbers

313
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,350
and it's a number soup,

314
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,103
but you'll notice it's
ISO/IEC 27006 part two.

315
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,610
And the reason that it's
a part two or dash two,

316
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,030
is because again it's
building on the fact that

317
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,030
27001 is an established
ecosystem of the standard

318
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,810
and the implementation
guidance and the certification.

319
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,300
So 27701 is leveraging
that, the part two of this

320
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,280
is what are the requirements
that an auditor needs to do

321
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,203
to audit for certification
27701 environment.

322
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,450
And that is what they're
in the process of making.

323
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,400
So when that happens, they will get that,

324
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,380
you'll be able to have certificates

325
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,380
that are done in a consistent
way based on an accreditation,

326
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,896
that would give you a
certificate for 27701.

327
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,390
Now you may ask well
why is that important?

328
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,320
Well it's important
because we want to be able

329
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,370
to use it for multiple regulations.

330
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,899
We wanna be able to have a
regulation or a regulator,

331
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,980
accept that certification so that

332
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,650
you don't have to do it 10
times, 15 times, 20 times.

333
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,183
It makes it a little more cost effective.

334
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,440
So when we look at that we say,

335
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,930
why then do we care?

336
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,063
And what are the benefits
to my organization?

337
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,700
Well the benefits to my
organization are that

338
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,480
PIMS is already gonna integrate

339
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,453
into your existing ISMS implementation.

340
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,840
If there's a potential, this
is where we hope to get to,

341
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,350
there's the potential that one audit

342
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,500
would satisfy multiple
privacy regulations.

343
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,270
And we're gonna talk
about why that's the case

344
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,280
and how that might happen.

345
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,730
It will help establish
the privacy best practices

346
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,070
that an organization needs to set up

347
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,659
and use to provide evidence
or do evidence generation.

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,280
What this means is that,

349
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,210
if I have a control, I
have to show evidence

350
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,240
that I've implemented
that control correctly.

351
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,610
How do I do that?

352
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,129
And then again the hope
is this will provide

353
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,690
that common industry baseline
for privacy certifications.

354
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,500
So like 27001 is the ISMS baseline

355
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,800
for security certifications,

356
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,220
we wanna see 27701 become that baseline

357
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,690
for privacy certification.

358
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,450
So again we get consistency
across the globe,

359
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,470
to help all organizations
raise the bar for security

360
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,800
as well as be able to
have smaller organizations

361
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,639
be able to have it cost effective

362
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,943
for them to meet these
security requirements.

363
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,010
So now that I've talked
about why this is beneficial,

364
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,770
to have this ISO standard,

365
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,663
we wanna get into how do
you actually use 27701?

366
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,800
And John is gonna talk us through

367
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,649
how the standard actually
works, how it's put together,

368
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,720
and then we'll get into
end with an example of

369
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,350
how you might use this
in multiple regulations.

370
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,080
John, over to you.

371
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,913
- Thanks Laura.

372
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,160
So the structure of ISO/IEC
27701 is rather straightforward.

373
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,900
The first part is the scope.

374
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,090
And if you've never read
an ISO standard before

375
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,760
the scope basically is the
tenants, the guardrails

376
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,640
however you wanna define what
the document talks about.

377
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,540
So as soon as you pick up 27701,
I recommend read the scope,

378
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,960
and see if that's applicable to your needs

379
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,680
with regards to privacy.

380
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,770
The second part is the
normative references.

381
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,100
And think of this as the
bibliography of the book, right?

382
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,250
It's talking about all of
the different standards

383
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,130
that are referenced in
27701 or any other standard.

384
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,630
And it's example we've
mentioned 27001 a lot,

385
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,537
that's in the normative
reference along with 27002

386
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:31,160
and a couple of others,
other ISO documents.

387
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,820
And then the terms and definitions.

388
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,159
So if ISO has to make a brand
new definition or uses a term,

389
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,660
we'll define that in this
terms and definitions.

390
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,490
And in ISO 27701, there's
actually two brand new terms

391
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,570
and we'll define those there.

392
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,639
Section four goes into,
it's just a general area,

393
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,370
talks about the structure of the document.

394
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,149
So it's going to reference
sections five, six, seven

395
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,450
and eight and how to go through

396
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,710
and find the particular areas
that you're looking for.

397
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,210
Section five and Laura
did a great job earlier

398
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,482
talking about controllers and PIMS

399
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:08,300
and processors and whatnot.

400
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,919
The section five will do the mapping

401
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,370
for PIMS specific 27001 requirements

402
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,750
and section six will go
into the 27002 requirements.

403
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,170
And then specifically section seven

404
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,800
will cover our PII controllers,

405
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,409
and how to look at and manage
those particular controls.

406
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,060
And then finally section eight talks about

407
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,030
the guidance for PII processors.

408
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,730
So that's a real high
level overview of 27701.

409
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,960
Gonna flip it over to Laura
and she's gonna give you,

410
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,803
oh wait this is my slide
too, I'm sorry Laura.

411
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,840
So we were talking about earlier,

412
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,090
all the different regulations.

413
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,520
So when you got GDPR and
pdpc out of Singapore

414
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,720
and the Australia privacy protection.

415
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,700
And then out of Korea,

416
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,140
there's the Personal
Information Protection Act.

417
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,470
And if you were responsible

418
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,193
for managing privacy guidance
and controls prior to 27701,

419
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,190
you would have to look at
all the different mappings

420
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,950
and make sure that you
have a plan of action

421
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,630
to make sure that you can do business

422
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,140
and adhere to GDPR in Australia,

423
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,010
in South Korea and Singapore,

424
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,700
and make sure that everything
is aligned properly.

425
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,210
But with 27701 think of it as you know,

426
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,730
the United Nations and how
they translate everything

427
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,190
into English and then from English

428
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,980
to all the different languages.

429
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,890
Or think of 27701 as a Rosetta Stone,

430
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,380
so that you can have a particular mapping

431
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,820
and use 27701 to guide you
through your privacy standards

432
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,159
and controls that are required

433
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,840
if you do business in Australia or Europe

434
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,699
or Singapore or the United States.

435
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,700
So really think of 27701
as that map and that bridge

436
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,430
to make your life easy,

437
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,590
when you're looking at privacy
controls and regulations.

438
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,330
And now Laura this is your slide,

439
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,673
so I'll let you talk, thank you.

440
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,470
- So I'm gonna talk about

441
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,505
a way that you can actually use this.

442
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:08,505
And this is a publicly,
freely available mapping tool.

443
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,629
So John showed on the previous slide

444
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,570
and I'm gonna jump back to
that slide really quick,

445
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,570
is that you have 27701 in the middle,

446
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,833
where you've got GDPR in Australia

447
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,820
and the Singapore and South Korea,

448
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,260
you've got all of these
that are mapping to that.

449
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,980
And if you didn't have a central
way to map, in other words,

450
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,880
if you didn't have that
Rosetta Stone as he mentioned,

451
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,750
how would you actually go about
mapping these to each other?

452
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,250
I mean you can see that just having four,

453
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,430
how many maps you might have.

454
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,584
So let's look at how we
might go about doing that.

455
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:48,520
So there is a mapping project,

456
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,190
it's called the data
protection mapping project.

457
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,360
And you can see that there's the URL,

458
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,540
it's at the bottom of the slide,

459
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,520
where you can actually
go and look at this.

460
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,220
And what I've done here is,

461
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,420
I've simply pulled out one example.

462
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,340
And I pulled it and looked at
it from three different ways.

463
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,970
One is, the first is your pulling GDPR

464
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,320
and it shows how 27701 is,

465
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,092
which clauses or which controls
you need to follow in 27701,

466
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,940
to meet that GDPR requirement.

467
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,680
And then also the Hong Kong

468
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,410
personal data protection ordinance,

469
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,220
what are the requirements
that it has in it?

470
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,513
And how did those map to 27701.

471
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,310
So when we look at this
you can see that it's,

472
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,899
if you look at GDPR and you
see that it's article five,

473
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,750
the principles relating to
processing of personal data.

474
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,050
And it specifically calls out that

475
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,050
for personal data shall be
adequate, relevant and limited

476
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,740
to what is necessary in
relation to the purpose

477
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,730
for which they are processed,

478
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,970
in other words data minimization.

479
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,423
And if we look at this
and we see that in 27701,

480
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,240
that there are five clauses here,

481
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,270
four of which are things that
the controller needs to do

482
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,030
and one of which is what
the processor needs to do.

483
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,113
And it spells out what it is
each of those needs to do.

484
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,780
What is interesting then about this is,

485
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,350
if I were to do those five,

486
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,350
I would not only meet the
GDPR article five one C,

487
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,200
but I would also meet the Hong Kong PDPO,

488
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,420
principle one, principle
two and number 26.

489
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,820
So all of a sudden when
I'm already doing this,

490
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,820
I am finding that I can
meet multiple regulations

491
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,703
just by following 27701.

492
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,419
What's nice about this particular tool

493
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,560
is that it allows you to do it either

494
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,040
by the full regulation,
the full standard 27701

495
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,110
or by particular clauses in each of those.

496
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,699
And if you have to meet,

497
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,250
let's say you had to meet GDPR and PDPO

498
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,630
and the Singapore requirements,

499
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,280
you could pull all of those
up and map that to 27701,

500
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,330
and it will automatically
do that in this tool.

501
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,970
Now to give you some
idea the mapping project

502
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,710
has already taken into account

503
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,770
Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore

504
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,850
and South Korea's
regulations to name a few.

505
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,550
But it's also taken in ISO/IEC 27701,

506
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,520
it's taken in if any of you have heard of

507
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,750
the NIST privacy framework
that they worked on in the US,

508
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,670
that's also mapped in this tool.

509
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,280
So it gives you a wide variety.

510
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Now again the tool is free,

511
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,230
so please take into account the fact that

512
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,940
this is not something legal,

513
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,340
but it gives you an idea of
how the mapping can be done.

514
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,560
And it does have a
disclaimer at the beginning,

515
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,720
but that you can look at
it and see how it works.

516
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,720
It's a way that 27701 can be
used to actually leverage,

517
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,750
if I get the evidence for
each of these controls,

518
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,190
I can show evidence for GDPR, PDPO

519
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,520
and many other different
regulations that I may have to meet

520
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,560
simply by doing one of them

521
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,300
rather than having to
figure it out for myself,

522
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,373
how do I map each of these individually?

523
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,090
So this gives you one practical
example of how that happens.

524
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,830
And hopefully with that,

525
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,639
you've actually learned a
little bit more about it.

526
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,280
Hopefully you'll have a
chance to go and look at it.

527
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,160
And we're gonna end up with,

528
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,640
hopefully you can find a way to apply

529
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,540
what you've learned today.

530
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,120
John, do you wanna
summarize this for them?

531
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,379
- Thanks Laura.

532
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,130
So next week and I know
it's Friday morning,

533
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,779
as we're listening to this in Singapore.

534
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,410
So take the rest of the day off

535
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,120
actually continue to go to
the rest of the RSA conference

536
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,820
for today and then have a great weekend.

537
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,800
But Monday morning start looking at

538
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,857
and determining which
privacy governance models

539
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:19,660
are impacted by your organization, right?

540
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,760
So look at where you're doing business,

541
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,883
look where your customers are located,

542
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:27,676
and try and identify those
different privacy governance's

543
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:28,960
that are going to be impact

544
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,500
or that will impact your organization.

545
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,650
And then within the first three months,

546
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,220
identify and choose the
privacy governance models

547
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,170
that work for you.

548
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,390
If all of your customers are in Australia

549
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,900
and you don't plan on doing
business outside of Australia,

550
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,780
maybe it's fine just to use
the Australian privacy plan.

551
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,320
But maybe you have plans to
grow outside of Australia

552
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,510
or Asia Pacific and conquer the world.

553
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,680
So look at the right privacy model

554
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,010
and the governance model
that works for you.

555
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,190
And then if you really are interested

556
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,800
in learning how the sausage is made

557
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,730
and how we all work
together internationally

558
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,720
to develop international standards.

559
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,590
I encourage you to go look at
your country's standards body

560
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,710
and participate, volunteer, get engaged

561
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,790
and be part of this
international community that goes

562
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,350
and tries to make the world
just a little bit better.

563
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,980
And then a final message
from me, stay safe

564
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,100
and I'll pass it over to
Laura for her final comment.

565
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,933
- Thank you.

566
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,760
Well hopefully you've all learned
something from this today.

567
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,180
And you'll know a little bit more about

568
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,060
what 27701 can do for you.

569
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,970
I do wanna mention, it was
mentioned at the beginning

570
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,300
but John and I will be staying
for a round table afterwards,

571
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,990
so you can ask additional questions

572
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,240
if you didn't get a question
asked during the session.

573
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,440
Please join us and thank
you very much for listening.

574
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,363
Everybody have a wonderful
day and a safe weekend.
