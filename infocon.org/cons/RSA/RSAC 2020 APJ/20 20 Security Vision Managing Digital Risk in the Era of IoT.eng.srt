00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,299
- [Announcer] No matter
what business you're in,

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,500
digital transformation never stops.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,690
At Verizon, we keep companies
ready for what's next.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,780
We weave security into their business,

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,430
virtualize their operations

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,720
and build AI customer experiences.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,890
We also keep them ready

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,463
for the next big opportunity, like 5G.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,233
Almost all of the fortune
500 partner with us.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,650
When it comes to digital transformation,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,483
we're here

12
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:39,367
and we're ready.

13
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:41,951
(bright music)

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,269

I'd now like to turn it over

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,853
to Art Fontaine for the presentation.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,750
- Thank you very much Rita.

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,760
Hi everybody, I'm Arthur Fontaine,

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,250
I'll also answer to Art.

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,810
I work in the Solutions
Strategy Area at RSA,

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,230
the part of the RSA company
that's the product side,

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,170
I'm not necessarily with
the conference side.

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,640
And I like to talk to you today about IoT,

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,810
internet of things, specifically,

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,240
how it engages your risk
and cybersecurity roles

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,449
at your company.

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,390
And some predictions about
where things are going

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,410
and what you can do to take advantage

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,792
of changes in the IoT market.

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,680
So let's start with just

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,170
kind of the market metrics.

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,440
This is certainly one of the
biggest market evolutions

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,530
that's come along in a long time,

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,800
certainly as big as cloud or even mobile.

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,170
One of the things I like to point out

42
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,460
that we're gonna have
three times as many devices

43
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,830
as people on this planet in
a few short years in 2025.

44
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,870
And by that time,

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,380
we're gonna be adding over
150,000 devices every minute

46
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,960
from the internet of things.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,810
Not surprisingly companies
are taking advantage of this.

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,170
We're seeing a majority of them reporting

49
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,829
that they have well
developed IoT initiatives,

50
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,590
and most of them have IoT budgets.

51
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,283
However, while there's a
lot of benefits to IOT,

52
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,960
it also brings into play a lot of risks

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,740
and other considerations

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,642
that we need to take a look at.

55
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,519
(clears throat) In this report,

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,550
from the US Congressional
Research Service.

57
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
We see that there's a concern

58
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,970
about just the sheer scale and breadth

59
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,140
of the categories of IOT devices.

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,959
You've got major categories

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,460
like the industrial internet of things,

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,360
the medical things, smart
cities, smart homes,

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,490
each with thousands, or
even tens of thousands

64
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,640
of different unique devices

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,250
that causes a lot of heartburn

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,620
for your cyber security folks,

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,780
because it's very
difficult to get a handle

68
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,440
on all of those devices.

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,800
When you know, they're
not really standardized

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
in any great way.

71
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,020
Which brings us to the other side of this,

72
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,877
and that's the policy issues.

73
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,210
And this is what is going

74
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,350
to engage your risk professionals

75
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,769
in your organization.

76
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,840
So the policy issues are
around the regulation of IoT.

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,330
You might find yourself in violation

78
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,710
of some standard regulation or law.

79
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,500
You also have digital privacy issues

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,780
where you could find

81
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,500
that you're losing private
or proprietary data.

82
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,840
And then of course you have
the data security issues.

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,650
In which case you might be hacked

84
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,750
and nobody likes to see that.

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,560
So we have a poll question for you.

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,250
We're gonna invoke that now.

87
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,810
I'm recording this ahead of time,

88
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,120
but I'll be in the Slido chat

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,950
so we can answer any
questions in real time.

90
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,019
The question I wanna ask,

91
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,130
is how involved are your cybersecurity

92
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,430
and risk professionals in
your IoT infrastructure?

93
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,140
And the answer is yes,
no, or I don't know.

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,510
And I'm gonna be very interested

95
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,910
to see your answers in that.

96
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,800
So at RSA,

97
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,240
we look at the digital transformations

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,210
as in context of the
digital risks they create.

99
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,090
Now, obviously the positive digital

100
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,710
of digital transformation
is that you are adding

101
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,710
new features, function, capabilities,

102
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,450
you're satisfying markets better,

103
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,570
you're building better products,

104
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,940
you're building better processes.

105
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,640
Each of those, however, would
bring you additional risks.

106
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,010
So we think about, you
know, the cyber attack risk

107
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,400
you might bring on with the
digital transformation like IOT.

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
The workforce risk,

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,469
the third party risk,

110
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,620
the privacy risks, the cloud risk.

111
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,890
All of these are the questions

112
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,070
that the customers are asking us today.

113
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,240
They're not so, you know,
talking about firewalls

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,470
or, you know, or blocking malware.

115
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,670
They're talking about
these big business problems

116
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,650
that they want to make sure

117
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,429
that they're addressing correctly

118
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,920
in order to take advantage
of the opportunity.

119
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,530
And one thing about IoT,

120
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,849
and again, I said, it's
as big as any of these

121
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,530
is that it will be
something that's involved

122
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,549
in all of your digital risks.

123
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,560
So no matter what problem

124
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,090
or what problem area you're attacking,

125
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,640
there's going to be an
IoT component of that.

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,960
And one of them that you've
probably heard of already

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,080
is around Distributed
Denial of Service attacks,

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,163
or DDoS.

129
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,000
Most of us have heard about
the Krebs on Security DDoS

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or the Dyn attack in 2016,

131
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,340
where insecure devices,

132
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
mostly cameras and DVRs were recruited

133
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,700
to have a DDoS attack

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,890
on a particular target.

135
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,440
We all know that the targets themselves

136
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,420
are you know typically suffering a lot

137
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,650
of hassle heartache, lost visibility.

138
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,440
Customers are having problems
interacting with these sites.

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,140
But an interesting study

140
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,969
from the University of
California, Berkeley

141
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,450
was around the other costs,

142
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,400
the hidden costs that
actually accrue to the folks

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,179
who own and deploy and
manage these devices.

144
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,920
And they did some analysis on this.

145
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,840
First of all, the Krebs
on Security Attack,

146
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,460
they found that over $300,000

147
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,770
in expense accrued to the
folks who owned those devices,

148
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,909
irrespective in and above
and beyond what happened

149
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,770
to the Krebs on Security website.

150
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,669
And the Dyn Attack,

151
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,290
which was the same year,

152
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,240
the Dyn DNS servers were all taken down,

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,990
leaving the internet unable to reach

154
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,870
many major websites for several hours.

155
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,440
That attack cost to others outside of Dyn,

156
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,410
was actually a little less,

157
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,300
a little over $100,000.

158
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,940
They also have done a calculation

159
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,580
where you can look at
a worst case scenario.

160
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,520
So in this case they've taken a look at

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,729
what could potentially happen

162
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,010
if this same model of DDoS attack

163
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,969
with hijacked devices were to take place.

164
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,150
And they found that it
could be up to $68 million.

165
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,640
This is a very interesting report

166
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,469
and I would certainly advise you to,

167
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,790
if you have a chance to
download it and go through it,

168
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,380
you can also play with this calculator

169
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,400
with some different variables to show

170
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,130
exactly what the impact would be

171
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,650
again, not on the victims,

172
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,640
but on the community of device owners

173
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,513
when one of these DDoS
attacks takes place.

174
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,640
Fortunately, there are a couple
of critical IT evolutions

175
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,090
that are underway that
are gonna help clean up

176
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,200
the hairball that we have
right now in the IOT space,

177
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,099
as well as position us in the future

178
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,900
for a much more manageable
and secure IOT foundation.

179
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,770
The first is edge computing
and edge computing

180
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,159
is an interesting concept

181
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,830
will go over in quite some detail here,

182
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,620
but what it essentially does

183
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,250
is it puts a layer between the devices

184
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,680
and the cloud services to
which they're connected

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,390
and to which they typically report.

186
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,940
That gives you a lot of flexibility

187
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,900
to do things you cannot do today,

188
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,462
including get things under
control and manage them.

189
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,040
The second major evolution

190
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,170
is around standards and frameworks.

191
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,980
As we all know IoT kind of grew up

192
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,240
outside the IT and risk world,

193
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,220
typically in operational technology

194
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,280
or OT or industrial control
systems or ICS environments

195
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,049
that run manufacturing,

196
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,840
that run distribution services,
energy systems, et cetera.

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,359
And many of them were purpose-built

198
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
for a single application.

199
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,530
And as such, the focus was on

200
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,200
how to make sure that
all of those applications

201
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,560
run reliably with no downtime

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,670
and deliver the value to the company.

203
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,720
Things like manageability, security,

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,780
certainly with thoughts,

205
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,349
but mightn't have kind
of taken a back seat

206
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,690
to some of the operational
requirements of the systems.

207
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,940
And the ability to apply
standards and frameworks,

208
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,360
both for manufacturers,

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,700
as well as folks who deploy these systems

210
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,690
is really of great promise

211
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,120
to make the whole IoT world,

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
work a lot better in the future.

213
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,060
We'll talk about that
going forward as well.

214
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,709
So let's talk first
about the edge computing

215
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,570
and this chart from the IEEE,

216
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,090
we see how the fundamental design

217
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,990
of today's existing systems works.

218
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,900
You have your IoT devices at the bottom,

219
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,980
and you have your,

220
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,300
kind of commanding control
systems at the top.

221
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,959
And each of these connects
directly from the device

222
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,350
to the cloud or data center application

223
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,810
to which it belongs.

224
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,619
And there's some good,

225
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,010
certainly some good factors around that.

226
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,300
One is that you can apply all sorts

227
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,199
of administration, security,

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,560
management, analytics

229
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,670
at the cloud or data center level

230
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,187
that attaches to the, you know,

231
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:28,900
the appropriate device.

232
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,380
And you can do all sorts
of data manipulation,

233
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,560
and you can command things back

234
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,353
to the devices themselves.

235
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,360
And, you know, when you
look at them individually,

236
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,400
that's actually a pretty clean operation.

237
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,819
The issue that arises

238
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,540
and has arisen over the past several years

239
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,180
is that as more and more of
these systems are deployed

240
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,719
in this kind of silo architecture,

241
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,020
they don't talk to each other

242
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,400
and they kind of multiply the task

243
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,230
of securing managing
de-risking these things.

244
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,960
And that's why typically
they haven't belonged

245
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,700
to the IT security

246
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,430
or the risk functions,

247
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,329
but to the operational functions

248
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,830
that actually deploy, manage them

249
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,433
and bring value to the business.

250
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,270
Again, works great,

251
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,890
the problem is being that,

252
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,300
it really has created a lot of complexity

253
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,959
and it makes it ever harder

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,350
to gain control of them.

255
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,170
So with edge computing,
it's a different approach.

256
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,339
What happens is that
through a number of small

257
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,660
but powerful gateway and server devices,

258
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,650
you create a middle layer,

259
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,860
that's sitting out toward the
actual devices at the edge,

260
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,770
that's why it's called edge computing.

261
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,910
And you are able to do some things

262
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,760
that you can't do in the siloed model,

263
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,080
specifically around, you know,

264
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,320
creating additional
processing and analytics.

265
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
At the edge, doing
things like data caching,

266
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,170
buffering optimization again at the edge

267
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,339
and particularly machine
to machine communication.

268
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,200
So in this case,

269
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,587
you can actually integrate the devices

270
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,040
and their applications

271
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,949
at the device level themselves,

272
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,540
not at the cloud or data center level.

273
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,400
So it's a kind of on the ground
or in the field integration

274
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,610
that isn't possible today.

275
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,940
When you talk about,
exactly what it looks like,

276
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,120
the anatomy of an IoT
solution and an IOT platform.

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,630
It looks pretty much like this.

278
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,050
You've essentially got your,

279
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,150
you know, your IoT end points

280
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,870
talking to your IoT apps

281
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,100
with the IoT platform in the middle.

282
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,550
What that allows you to do

283
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,469
is you can enable these core services

284
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,450
such as data management,
device management,

285
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,810
discoveries, security, risk management,

286
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,810
right in that middle layer

287
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,180
as a common layer across all

288
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,839
of the different
applications and services.

289
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,130
And what it allows you to do

290
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,780
as an open and an extensible platform

291
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,800
is to let vendors who do things well,

292
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,130
do the things that they do well.

293
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,070
So if you've been a vendor

294
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,140
who's good at discovering
devices and inventorying them

295
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,020
and knowing what their capabilities are,

296
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,960
what patches they need, et cetera,

297
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,260
that vendor can participate
and contribute to the ecosystem

298
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,100
where multiple vendors can do that.

299
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,480
And you, as a customer could choose

300
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,150
which vendor you wanna use.

301
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,870
Similarly, with security,

302
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,830
you have the ability to
add security at that layer

303
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,430
in a very powerful way.

304
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,339
And again, you could choose

305
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,270
from multiple vendors to apply,

306
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,050
that level of functionality.

307
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,339
So it really is important
to be able to understand

308
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,540
that this middleware layer is all about

309
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,120
taking the previously
separate applications

310
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,150
and making them behave as one.

311
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,810
Let's take a look at an example

312
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,020
that I think, especially
for the technical folks

313
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,780
in the audience will give a better view

314
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,199
of what's going on in this case.

315
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,650
So this edge platform architecture

316
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,492
is one called EdgeX Foundry.

317
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,390
It's an open Apache.2 Dato Driven project

318
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,590
that's hosted by the Apache

319
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm sorry, the Linux Foundation.

320
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,780
And it's available
freely to anybody to use

321
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,640
and certainly available
for any community member

322
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,080
to contribute to and to enhance.

323
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,270
So let's take a look at something

324
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,460
that's not uncommon in the world of IoT

325
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,740
where you'll get an alert

326
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,740
from a particular piece of
equipment in the system.

327
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,040
Now this is all loosely
coupled of microservices,

328
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,569
but there are some core services

329
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,840
that come with the Foundation

330
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,740
that can be exploited
directly out of the box,

331
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,790
or it could be replaced
with other versions.

332
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,589
But when something like
a temperature sensor

333
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,990
detects that it's 102 degrees

334
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,260
and that's out of the envelope

335
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,200
that you would typically work with,

336
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,430
then that alert would be
sent from the device itself

337
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,175
using in this case the back net protocol

338
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:49,040
to the core data services layer,

339
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,900
which then forwards it

340
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,800
on to additional services

341
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,620
and then onward to the
application itself in the cloud.

342
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,030
So you've gone southbound
to northbound with that,

343
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,863
but you've passed

344
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:03,000
through the EdgeX Foundation
platform to do that.

345
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,150
Nothing that the system

346
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,470
that has been installed sees

347
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,890
is anything different than it's ever seen.

348
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,280
And it really is just, you know,

349
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,560
from the device to the application.

350
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,810
But since you've run it
through this middleware layer,

351
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,000
you have the ability to do other things.

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,370
And some of these things as
you'll see are very useful.

353
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,320
So in this case, one of the services

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
that passed, you know, passively passed

355
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,040
that information onto the cloud,

356
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
takes a look at this and says,

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,060
hey, let's run it
through the rules engine.

358
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,119
Let's do some local analytics.

359
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,290
And doing so, they've discovered

360
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,060
that the high temperature

361
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,280
is due to one of the devices

362
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,113
in the system,

363
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,520
which might talk a
completely different protocol

364
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,240
MQTT in this instance,

365
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,990
we'll talk about that in a minute.

366
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,580
And it turns out there's
machine that's overheated.

367
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,150
Well here, right in the application layer,

368
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,540
in the middleware layer,

369
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,240
you can automatically have the system

370
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,570
using analytics shut off the machine

371
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,210
that's creating the temperature problem.

372
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,363
Whereas in the pure kind
of traditional model,

373
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,140
that alert would have gone to one system

374
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,240
and something would have had
to happen up in the cloud

375
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,520
or data center layer

376
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,550
that would have taken that information,

377
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,780
turned it into actionable intelligence

378
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,500
and caused something or somebody

379
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,750
to go and stop the machine
that's causing the problem.

380
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,870
So, as you can see,

381
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,340
you know, a simple kind of,

382
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,160
you know, if then command set

383
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,490
can ring this whole loop closed

384
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,390
and create much more value

385
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,310
than any of these individual systems

386
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,369
could have on their own.

387
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,800
Now, since this is a modular architecture,

388
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,620
you can add all sorts of capabilities.

389
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,320
One of the beauties of the edge gateway

390
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,910
and server architecture

391
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,339
is that it's a place to put an agent.

392
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,370
You really can't put an agent in many

393
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,460
or even most pure IoT devices,

394
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,410
because many of them don't
have the processing power

395
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,310
or the memory to handle an agent

396
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,319
without slowing down

397
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,260
or potentially being impacted.

398
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,080
And many of them are
deployed in places and ways

399
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,850
that you probably wouldn't
be able to get to easily.

400
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,970
So giving, you know, attaching
those devices to the gateway,

401
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,140
gives you a place to put a very
powerful agent if you want.

402
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,010
And you can do things that are different

403
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,710
than what you could do
in the traditional model.

404
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,180
So in this instance,

405
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,219
we could apply a security monitoring agent

406
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,530
that would also integrate with
the rest of the application

407
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,920
and in this particular problems
that we just talked about,

408
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,270
talk to the core services,

409
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,380
as well as potentially other environmental

410
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,350
external information sources,

411
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,300
and then send that information
off to a security cloud.

412
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,290
And that security cloud,

413
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,790
could then look at this anomalous behavior

414
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,610
and say, you know, analyze it,

415
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,720
whether it's something that
was just a random failure

416
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,580
or might be something that's associated

417
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,350
with an exploit or an
intrusion of some sort.

418
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,910
So this is, you know,

419
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,869
again, this is passive,

420
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,829
we're not getting in the
way of the application

421
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,230
or it's performance.

422
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,270
We're just observing what's going through

423
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,359
and acting upon it if appropriate.

424
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,193
And one example of this

425
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,869
is the RSA IoT security monitor service

426
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,000
that we've got to do exactly
what we're describing here,

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
but you could do this
for any feature function,

428
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,819
and you can do this with many vendors.

429
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,510
It's totally up to the customer,

430
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,650
essentially, future-proofing
your deployment

431
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,800
because you can actually work
with any vendor at any time,

432
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,909
instead of being locked into one of these

433
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,660
you know proprietary vendors
proprietary protocols.

434
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,463
So very exciting stuff.

435
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,610
So the second half of what's going on,

436
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,469
that's really important,

437
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,420
is this evolution of
standards and frameworks.

438
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,460
Because initially, as I mentioned before,

439
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,400
most of these products and
services and applications

440
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,010
were purpose-built and they
were necessarily engineered

441
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,810
to the tightest possible standards

442
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,360
to give you what you
wanted as an application,

443
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,090
not necessarily in context

444
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,340
of all of the other things

445
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,780
that you might wanna do
when you're an organization,

446
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,399
especially around IT security and risk.

447
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
So the emergence of these
standards and frameworks

448
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,639
gives us something,

449
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,940
a layer of commonality

450
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,240
that we're you know be able

451
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,300
to take advantage of going forward,

452
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,930
and really does hold the
promise of cleaning things up.

453
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,370
And I'll walk through a few of these

454
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,300
to give you an example

455
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,450
exactly of what they're delivering

456
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,400
in context of what we're trying to do,

457
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,170
to you know, not just clean
up the existing problems

458
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,440
with all of these brownfield deployments

459
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,740
or existing deployments,

460
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,080
but to give us a roadmap

461
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,600
on how to eliminate or minimize

462
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,800
such inconsistencies and
problems in the future,

463
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,379
and bring us to a world where
IoT is, you know, like IT,

464
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,143
largely and integrated
manageable infrastructure.

465
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,090
So the first one I
wanna point out is NIST.

466
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,620
So the National Institute
of Standards and Technology

467
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,330
in the US has developed for manufacturers

468
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,970
of IoT devices and systems,

469
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,000
a set of a cyber security
capability core baseline,

470
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,520
as well as the activities

471
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,760
that should take place for
IoT device manufacturers.

472
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
We looked at those digital risks before.

473
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,640
And one of those is third party risk.

474
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,860
One of the third party risks

475
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,030
that customers are worried about

476
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,340
is something being implanted
in the supply chain.

477
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,870
It's a malware or an extra chip

478
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,620
on a circuit board somewhere

479
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,330
implanted by a nation state.

480
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,090
You never know where
something might have been put

481
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,419
into the system before you even got it.

482
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,560
Well, companies that follow and conform

483
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,990
to things like the NIST
standards in this area

484
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,140
are going to offer a much
higher level of assurance

485
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,420
that the devices and
systems that you deploy

486
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,410
haven't been hacked

487
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,970
or you know otherwise compromised

488
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,743
before they even got
unpacked from the box.

489
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,330
Next one I'd like to
talk about is the MQTT.

490
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,840
Now this is the telemetry transport

491
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,270
or machine to machine connectivity,

492
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,740
and it's been around for awhile,

493
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,130
continues to mature.

494
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,780
It's extremely lightweight.

495
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,399
It's very useful for connections

496
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,270
that are remote,

497
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,200
they'll have a small code footprint

498
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,810
or when network bandwidth

499
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,139
is either intermittent or at a premium.

500
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,510
So it's ideal for these
mobile applications, you know,

501
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,180
energy meters, you know,

502
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,040
distribution points for
cable TV, et cetera,

503
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,879
the things that are kinda
out in the community

504
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,240
that can't be easily physically touched

505
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,040
or, you know, dealt with

506
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,680
and have typically very low power.

507
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,860
MQTT gives them a way
to talk to each other.

508
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,870
And as this is something that's supported

509
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,840
by the edge frameworks,

510
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,389
it means you can do it at the edge

511
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,040
instead of going back and
forth to the server to do that.

512
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,530
The next one is the OPC UA

513
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,460
or the Unified Architecture.

514
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,280
And this is kinda derived from
a long historical sequence

515
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:57,800
of inter application protocols,

516
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,230
starting with the COM
framework for Microsoft.

517
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,840
And what it does is the
Unified Architecture

518
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,389
gives you a way and a platform

519
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,120
to integrate all of these
individual classic specifications

520
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,409
into a coherent

521
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,240
set of processes and designs

522
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,090
that you can work between systems with.

523
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,689
So again, really easy to use

524
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,210
takes a lot of things that are hard

525
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,900
to conceptually, you know kinda grok

526
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,320
and then implement

527
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,899
and give you a way to put them to place

528
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,260
very easily with security
and extensibility.

529
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,610
For example, EdgeX Foundry
we talked about that

530
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,310
this is the open source project
hosted by Linux Foundation.

531
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,060
It's one of many, there
are several Edge platforms,

532
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,639
including from the cloud
service providers themselves,

533
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,760
all of them have the same kind of design

534
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,230
of getting the computing
and the management

535
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,890
and the security out to
where the devices are

536
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,860
and being extensible
with products and service

537
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,090
from different community members.

538
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,500
So, you know, this whole ecosystem

539
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,050
or plug and play components

540
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,930
really gives a lot of capability

541
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,514
that we discussed earlier in this session

542
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:11,514
and empowering the people
who deploy and manage IoT

543
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,053
to you know get control
of them and secure them.

544
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,410
So the IEEE has a number of standards.

545
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,400
The draft standard P2413

546
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,500
for architectural
framework is very useful.

547
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,420
It defines that architectural framework

548
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,160
and describes the various IoT domains,

549
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,760
the abstraction, et cetera.

550
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,100
And there's a couple of sub drafts

551
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,810
for a smart city and power distribution

552
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,230
could be more in the future.

553
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,063
Again, these are just

554
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:43,650
kind of larger conceptual frameworks

555
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,714
that folks can kind of map
their activities against

556
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:50,520
and add coherence to what they're doing

557
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,593
in the IoT world.

558
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,500
The IIC or Industrial Internet Consortium,

559
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,333
has what's called

560
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,260
the Industrial Internet
Security Framework or IISF.

561
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,070
And this is again another

562
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,590
kind of large comprehensive resource

563
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,220
for understanding how things

564
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,670
are put together properly
in the IoT world,

565
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,560
including security best practices,

566
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,620
and the building blocks
for security concerns

567
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,010
and an implementation
guidance and techniques model.

568
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,760
And importantly it also includes

569
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,830
an IoT Security Maturity Model or SMM.

570
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,020
And what this allows you to do

571
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,060
is to measure where you are

572
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,379
and where you need to go

573
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,160
in terms of the maturity model,

574
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,410
very similar to you know

575
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,200
some of the NIST maturity
models for cybersecurity,

576
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,350
where if you evaluate yourselves

577
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,090
against you know what's really done well,

578
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,399
you can find out where you are

579
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,270
and where you have room to improve.

580
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,070
So this is, you know,

581
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,899
helps IoT providers and
implementers understand

582
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,750
where they need to be and it
enables intelligent choices.

583
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,060
FIDO, which is the identity group

584
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,590
has an IoT technical working group

585
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,889
that's doing some very
exciting things as well.

586
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,430
And in the end game for this,

587
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,530
you'll be able to treat in many respects,

588
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,530
your IoT devices, like any other entity

589
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,407
on your network with its own identity

590
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,750
or unique identifier.

591
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,040
And it will be able to provide

592
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,120
device attestation and authentication.

593
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,239
You can do some automation
of your onboarding

594
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,950
and binding of applications.

595
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,760
You can do authentication provisioning,

596
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,050
you can do access control.

597
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,090
So you can say this application or device

598
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,189
can only talk to these things

599
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,530
and only do those activities.

600
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,120
Again, locking down the capabilities

601
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,889
of some of these devices and apps

602
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,010
to a way that's consistent

603
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,160
with best security and
identity and processes

604
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,093
and lifecycle and governance as well.

605
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,709
So ETSI and DDS have
done a couple of things.

606
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,670
The object management groups,

607
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,480
data distribution service
for real time systems

608
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,130
is a virtual global data space.

609
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,440
So again, everything in that data space

610
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,570
will be unique and interconnected.

611
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,409
It will give you a place
where applications can share.

612
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,350
You can have quality
of service parameters,

613
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,350
including reliability,
bandwidth, deadlines,

614
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,929
resource limits, et cetera,

615
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,330
really kinda tune what you're doing

616
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,530
with these applications and these devices.

617
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,149
And it also supports the
construction of local object models

618
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,040
that fit into the global
data space environment,

619
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,420
and you know kind of become

620
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,233
a component of that automatically.

621
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,620
ETSI has done something called the M2M

622
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,699
or the radio standards

623
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,800
for to machine real time communications

624
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,970
that allows you to do things wirelessly

625
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,950
and, you know, conforming
to this particular standard

626
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,220
will open up a universe of other things

627
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,980
you can communicate with,

628
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,150
without individual or
kinda custom programming

629
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,983
to make things happen,

630
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:47,389
which traditionally has
been a lot of the work

631
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,410
that goes into one of these integrations

632
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,200
is making the things talk to each other

633
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,550
with the use of these
growing body of standards.

634
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,050
You really get a lot of
that effort and time back.

635
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,070
ISO/IEC is another great one.

636
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,450
So they've created these
global standards and frameworks

637
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,620
for IoT around information
technology vocabulary,

638
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,540
interoperability both from a framework

639
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,920
and a transport perspective.

640
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,950
IoT use cases that you can study

641
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,900
and conform to in terms of best practices.

642
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,450
They've also got one on edge computing

643
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,050
and another on industrial IoT.

644
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,970
So these important emerging areas

645
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,340
in how people are actually
deploying these IoT systems.

646
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,986
And lastly, the IETF has an RFC,

647
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:36,120
and this is kind of a
really large, broad view

648
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,659
analysis in an investigation of space

649
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,420
it's a document that
implementers and designers

650
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,620
and authors of IoT specs, other IoT specs,

651
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,300
including implementers have a reference,

652
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,960
for details about security
considerations, challenges,

653
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,350
threat models and mitigation.

654
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,959
So this is really another great document

655
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,670
to absorb and to conform to,

656
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,440
as you design your own
systems and solutions.

657
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,930
So all of these together,

658
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,740
I think you'll agree
offer promise to clean up

659
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,220
some of the traditional problems we've had

660
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,770
in trying to do more than
single things at a time

661
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,350
with the IoT world.

662
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,350
And they're very important.

663
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,360
They give us a lot of kind of roadmap

664
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,409
to where we wanna be in terms of security,

665
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,000
manageability, risk reduction, et cetera.

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,133
And very importantly,

667
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,980
you don't have to adopt all of them.

668
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,870
I would say that if you've
adopted one of them,

669
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,199
you've improved your posture very greatly

670
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,510
in your IoT deployment, especially
around security and risk.

671
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,503
So let's wrap this up,

672
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:46,500
just a couple of finishing
points and recommendations

673
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,250
that I'd like to leave you with.

674
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,320
So again, we're talking about
security and risk managers.

675
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,020
There's a whole bunch of operational folks

676
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,070
who are very interested in this as well.

677
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,460
What we're trying to do here,

678
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,880
is to illustrate the value

679
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,230
of integrating your IoT,

680
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,290
not just as an operational activity,

681
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,290
but within your organizational
security and risk procedures.

682
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,700
So I would urge you to make IoT

683
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,130
part of your risk and security plans

684
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,790
treat it like any other digital risk,

685
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,080
like cloud, like mobile, like
third party, like privacy,

686
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,820
and engage all the right functional areas.

687
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,840
This gives you a way to address the kudzu

688
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,459
or freely deployed devices
that are out there.

689
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,270
Kudzu is a Southern US vines

690
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,879
that tends to cover and
engulf anything it touches,

691
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,780
whether trees or poles
or bridges or whatever.

692
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,010
And, you know, we have customers tell us

693
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,725
that that's what it feels like.

694
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,189
You know, one anecdote is we were talking

695
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,710
to a large manufacturing
company here in the US,

696
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,910
a Black Hat last year in Las Vegas.

697
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,380
And one of the IT security
managers said to us

698
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,600
that he doesn't even know how many

699
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,860
or what type of IoT devices are deployed

700
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,693
in their environment,

701
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:54,940
'cause they've been
pretty permissive about it

702
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,020
through the years.

703
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,379
And that the only way he can find out

704
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,060
is to unplug something and
wait for somebody to scream,

705
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,260
and it's certainly no
way to run a business.

706
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,669
The other point I'd like to make here

707
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,850
is that you wanna empower your IoT use,

708
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,409
where you don't want to be,

709
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,770
is seen as the blocker

710
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,710
or the thing that keeps people

711
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,260
from doing what they want to do

712
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,790
to improve operationally the business.

713
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,280
So let's encourage use of IoT

714
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,230
wherever and whenever appropriate,

715
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,560
but impose security and risk review

716
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,159
and create a playbook that helps people

717
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,600
who want to deploy IoT
in their organization

718
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,699
to get them to where they wanna go

719
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,620
without the friction of you know feeling

720
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,320
that they're being restricted
or held back in any way.

721
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,080
And lastly, I'd like to
just kind of tell you

722
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,520
some points around
de-risking IoT in general,

723
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,900
just have these questions in mind

724
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,040
when you consider the topic.

725
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,280
Do we have a handle on our
current IoT deployments?

726
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,870
Where do challenge exist today

727
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,989
in the existing or
brownfield device deployment?

728
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,670
Are there any proprietary
or siloed systems

729
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,533
that you wanna integrate?

730
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:59,120
And you know, sometimes the
answer's gonna be no here

731
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,100
that they just should exist
in a silo where they are now,

732
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,760
but in many cases you'll find
opportunities to integrate,

733
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,450
especially at the edge layer

734
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,950
where you can you know take advantage

735
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,140
of having systems work together.

736
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,500
Ask yourself, do we really know

737
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,640
what's out there in our environment?

738
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,313
Do we start unplugging things.

739
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,450
You'll find that there's probably more

740
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,450
out there than you thought.

741
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,670
There's IoT devices in your coffee makers,

742
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,800
in your conference room TVs, right?

743
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,899
So do you inventory those?

744
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,810
Do you lock them down

745
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,379
and do you de-risk them?

746
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,720
And then lastly,

747
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,160
what is your strategy for
future IoT deployments?

748
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,340
Because it's very likely

749
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,350
that the areas of standards and of edge

750
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,490
are going to apply very quickly to you

751
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,350
and, you know, kind of
shooting where the puck is,

752
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,669
heading where the puck is being shot

753
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,610
is where you wanna be there so.

754
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,443
Ask yourself,

755
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,730
have we implemented or considered

756
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,570
or investigated an edge architecture?

757
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,320
And are we able to track
and prove conformance

758
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,419
to standards and frameworks

759
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,230
either individually using the frameworks

760
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,230
or with our integrated risk products?

761
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,230
Know that's what your
risk team wants to do

762
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,063
is to take these things

763
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:01,740
and plug them into their environment

764
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,200
and make them manageable,

765
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
like any other risks in the organization.

766
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,470
So with that, I think my time is up.

767
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,340
I really appreciate talking to you today.

768
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,600
If there are any questions,

769
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,689
I'm in the Slido chat right now,

770
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,810
and hopefully we're
having a nice interaction.

771
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,580
I'm Art Fontaine,

772
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,870
feel free to reach out to me

773
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,219
or to follow me online @arthurfontaine.

774
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,510
And I look forward to
seeing you again next year,

775
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,350
hopefully in person in Singapore.

776
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,183
Thank you.
