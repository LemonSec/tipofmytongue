24
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,169
- Human factors or human failures?

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,440
Welcome to a walkthrough

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,360
of a business email compromise scam.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,080
My name is Kai Roer.

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
I am the managing director
of the research center

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,500
for KnowBe4 called Culture.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,040
With me today, I have Espen Otterstad,

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
who is the acting CISO of the
European telemetrics company,

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,363
ABAX AS.

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,700
We are here today to share their story

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,410
about business email compromise.

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,440
And we'll also go into
a little bit details.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,410
So why this talk about
business email compromise?

37
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,190
Well, first of all, this is
a huge and global phenomenon.

38
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,200
This happens to organizations
around the world.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,620
No organization out there is actually safe

40
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,540
for these kind of scams.

41
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,750
This is something that we've
seen in the United States,

42
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,090
in Norway.

43
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,580
We've seen it in Australia.

44
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,990
We've seen it everywhere.

45
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,929
In the United States alone, last year,

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,310
more than 24,000 cases

47
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,890
of business email
compromise were recorded.

48
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,890
A total payout of more than 26
billion United States dollars

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,019
were spent or paid out
in these kinds of scams.

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,870
That's a huge amount of money.

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,993
Next time, give them to me instead.

52
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:20,260
The other reason that we think
business email compromise

53
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,440
is an important topic to tackle here

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,660
at the RSA Conference is that

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,630
these are highly organized criminals.

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,900
They have been planning
this for some time.

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,790
They have operationalized their operations

58
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,700
and they know exactly what to do.

59
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,579
They have scripts that takes them through

60
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,100
the different stages and stop signals

61
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,859
or kill switches, if you like,

62
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,130
when they feel like, okay,
we have been compromised.

63
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,540
So when the criminals have
been compromised, they leave.

64
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,673
The question then is what
happens when you are compromised?

65
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,550
What does the timeline of
a business email compromise

66
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,670
look like?

67
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, from a high level,
it looks like this.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,340
You start with a phishing or a
successful phishing campaign.

69
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,830
Typically where you or
someone in your organization

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,553
give away the credentials and
the access to an email system.

71
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,910
When that happens, you are owned.

72
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,440
Someone, the criminal have
access to all your information,

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,070
all your emails, the
history, your supply chains,

74
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,790
and all the invoice data.

75
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,690
They use this then to set up the scam

76
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,609
and their goal is to
make you send them money

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,443
while you think

78
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:43,220
that you actually send
money to your supplier.

79
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,950
That's a fantastic scam,
if you're the criminal.

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,329
And very often what we see here is that

81
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,340
these kinds of incidents,
you discover them

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,970
after you make that payout.

83
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,609
So first you get phished,
then you get owned,

84
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,660
then you make a money transfer,

85
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,563
and then you discover it too late.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,350
Now, Espen your organization

87
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,993
had this kind of experience last year.

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,750
Before we dig into the
details of the scam at ABAX,

89
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,390
could you share with us
how the normal situation

90
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,673
when you work with your suppliers.

91
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,880
- Of course, Kai.

92
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,710
As you said, a normal situation for us

93
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,250
is that we have a lot of suppliers,

94
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,230
both small and some of
them are a bit larger,

95
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,730
like the one in ABAX.

96
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,360
The normal situation is
that communication flows

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,320
both on the higher level

98
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,090
between senior vice president

99
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,799
in the supplier chain

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,070
and maybe a director in our organization,

101
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,283
but also on the more operational level,

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,750
between accountings
departments, for example.

103
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,380
So, things flows normally.

104
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,219
We are invoiced every
month from this supplier.

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,323
So that is basically
how it works, normally.

106
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,200
- So, this sounds like a
normal business relationship.

107
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,853
- Yeah, normal businesses
relationship, relatively relaxed,

108
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,143
easy communication.

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,220
We communicate in English

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,830
and neither our companies
are native English speakers.

111
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,469
That is probably something

112
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,623
that will be key for this
incident we will find out later.

113
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,070
- So, in a normal situation,
you have a supplier,

114
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,290
you deal with them and
you make some payments.

115
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,850
And then at some point last year,

116
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,730
we had someone accessing your system.

117
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,563
- Yeah.

118
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,190
As you described in the timeline,

119
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,193
we were a victim of a
random phishing campaign.

120
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,590
One of our senior directors,

121
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,017
actually went ahead and
clicked on the link,

122
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,210
gave away his credentials.

123
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,570
And we were owned,

124
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,070
the criminals had access
to his email accounts,

125
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,920
of course, without us knowing it.

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,373
- And what did the criminals
do when they had this access?

127
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,700
- They started off with, what
we could call investigation.

128
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,490
They started digging through his email.

129
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,800
They looked into his One Drive.

130
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,930
Looked at documents,

131
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,523
obviously to find suitable
candidates for a scam.

132
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,600
And they didn't use long time.

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,610
Within 24 hours, we found out

134
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,270
that they had registered
a fake domain name,

135
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,332
very similar to one of our
suppliers domain names.

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,272
That was how it all started.

137
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,040
- That means that within
24 hours of gaining access

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,750
to the email system,

139
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,010
the criminals already
had chosen their targets.

140
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,020
- Yeah.

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,760
Obviously we don't know if
they chose multiple targets,

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,130
but the target we know of, they
had chosen within 24 hours.

143
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,990
So they were efficient.

144
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,580
They knew what they were looking for,

145
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,082
and they worked quick.

146
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,920
- Then what started to happen?

147
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,240
- What started to happen was actually,

148
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,840
initially the criminals
didn't do anything.

149
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,710
They registered the domain
and they started waiting.

150
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,549
They are actually waiting
for the timing to be correct.

151
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,210
They needed to find an invoice

152
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,840
that was quite old, or not old,

153
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,140
but that was sent some time ago.

154
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,613
So it was natural for us to have paid it.

155
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,450
- So they selected an invoice

156
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,719
and waited for that invoice
to go past the due date?

157
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,340
- Yeah.

158
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,210
And then they started
with the intervention.

159
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,950
They actually started to set up a story

160
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,430
or they set up two stories

161
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,690
and that's key here, of course.

162
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,650
They set up one story toward us,

163
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,712
claiming that we had paid
into the wrong account.

164
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,450
And then they set up a
story toward our supplier

165
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,960
claiming that we had paid
from the wrong account.

166
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,250
And both these stories
eventually of course means

167
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,810
that the payments needs to be reversed.

168
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,773
So this is how they started the scam.

169
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,020
- I think, as you said,
it's a key part here

170
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,299
that they set up, not only
one story to trick you guys,

171
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,120
but the second story that they will use

172
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,640
to trick your supplier into authorizing

173
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,470
the transactions that are
necessary on their part.

174
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,530
- Absolutely.

175
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,230
- But I also think it's
really important to know that,

176
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,850
or your organization thought
you were communicating

177
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,130
with your supplier

178
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,530
and your supplier thought they
communicated with you guys.

179
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,420
- Yes, and that is of course the key here.

180
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,449
Because since they have access

181
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,320
to our director's email account,

182
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,520
they could easily fake the
communication both ways.

183
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,390
They have the fake email
domain and they had access

184
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,530
to one of our email accounts

185
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,939
so they could fake transactions both ways.

186
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,950
And that is really important
for the scam to work.

187
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,680
At this time we had no
knowledge of this being fake.

188
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,120
- And then what happened?

189
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,193
- After that,

190
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,550
they started to introduce,

191
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,923
actually to start sending emails,

192
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,140
to both us from the fake
domain and to our supplier.

193
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,630
They started to push

194
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,939
for the reversal of
the payment, of course.

195
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,110
- But did they send the
emails to your supplier

196
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,920
from the fake domain?

197
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,752
- No.

198
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,820
They sent emails to our supplier from us,

199
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,460
from the compromised account,

200
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,850
and they sent emails from our
supplier from the fake domain.

201
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,530
And that's of course, where we
had the potential to spot it.

202
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,910
But, in a normal working day,

203
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,252
you won't notice one letter
different in an email domain.

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,883
So, they started sending emails,

205
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,160
we started to communicate,

206
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,992
obviously with the fake, or the criminals,

207
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,760
regarding the reversal.

208
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,210
And after a while we felt,

209
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,760
or our accounting department
felt that this was real.

210
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,583
We need to reverse the payment.

211
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,730
We contacted our bank,

212
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,210
which again, contacted the Polish bank,

213
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,960
which is on the receiving end here.

214
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,040
And they did the right thing.

215
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,510
They started to ask questions.

216
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,760
- So the bank system actually
started asking questions

217
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
about what is going on?

218
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,319
- Yeah.

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,060
The Polish bank said that,

220
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,199
to actually reverse the payment,

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,780
they need confirmation
from the vice president

222
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,193
at our supplier.

223
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,130
And here,

224
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,910
when they're starting to ask questions

225
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,569
is one of the key elements in the case.

226
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,590
Because when he was asked the question,

227
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,830
he of course contacted our senior director

228
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,123
to get confirmation of the reversal.

229
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,160
But before that, the criminals
had put up email filters

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,660
in our senior director's inbox.

231
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,900
So the email never showed up in his inbox.

232
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,590
It was put in another folder

233
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,490
where you would never look for emails.

234
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,089
They, the criminals, saw this coming in

235
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,840
and quickly responded to it,

236
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,110
confirming that the
reversal should be done.

237
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,173
It was correct.

238
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,350
And of course the vice
president at our supplier

239
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,100
thought that, okay, this is
the confirmation we need.

240
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,600
And they authorized the bank
in Poland to reverse the money.

241
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,970
- So at this point, the vice
president of your supplier,

242
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,020
think he is communicating
with your director

243
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,120
while in fact he is communicating directly

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,690
with a criminal instead?

245
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,390
- Yeah, he's communicating directly

246
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,620
with the criminal through our email.

247
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,570
So it was through our email system.

248
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,910
But he was communicating with a criminal.

249
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,240
- And then he bought that
story that you had paid out

250
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,950
from a wrong bank account.

251
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,730
- Yes.
- Which meant that

252
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,040
he could go back to his bank

253
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,819
and say, well, we actually have
to revert this transaction.

254
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,310
- Yeah, and we bought the story

255
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,510
because they claimed, of course,

256
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,830
that the account we paid to,

257
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,690
they weren't able to
get the money out of it.

258
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,680
So yeah.

259
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,949
Both sides have now bought the story.

260
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,900
There's no questions asked at all.

261
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,260
This is now more a matter
of our accounting department

262
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,350
trying to do their job, trying to solve it

263
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,090
and get the invoice paid.

264
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,420
- And to what extent did
your accounting department

265
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,963
take this personally?

266
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,530
- I would say that they are
proud of their job, of course.

267
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,425
So their goal is to pay the invoices,

268
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:19,589
we get correctly at the right time

269
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,543
to the correct receiver.

270
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,090
So I think they basically did their job.

271
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,703
And as long as they don't
suspect anything wrong,

272
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,810
they went ahead and tried
to solve a situation,

273
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,020
which had arised.

274
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,220
- Exactly.

275
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,830
They were being forced or
pushed by the criminals

276
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,960
into a situation where they
no longer felt comfortable.

277
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,500
And to some extent, maybe even felt

278
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,420
that they had made some kind of a mistake.

279
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,689
And we all know what
happens to a human person

280
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,853
when you are pushed into
a stressful situation.

281
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,200
- And after the payment was reversed,

282
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,390
the pressure increased because
now the criminals starting

283
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,699
to increase their activity--

284
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,760
- And by reverse, just
to make this very clear

285
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,910
by reverse, you mean that the Polish bank

286
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,780
sent back the money to
your bank in Norway?

287
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,579
- Correct.
- Based on what

288
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,373
the criminals had asked them to do.

289
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,939
Or also you and the supplier to do.

290
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,030
And now the money is back in Norway

291
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,020
and the criminals are back saying,

292
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,480
hey, now pay it to the right account.

293
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,320
- Yes, that's correct.

294
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,800
So, initially they started
to ask a lot of questions

295
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,209
about how long will the reversal take.

296
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,590
Can you confirm that the money

297
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,740
is reversed into your account?

298
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,470
And of course it creates stress

299
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,020
with our accounting department.

300
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,920
And, when the money was actually reversed,

301
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
they changed and said, can you confirm

302
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,223
that you have paid the amount
to the correct account?

303
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,250
So the whole time they stressed
the accounting department.

304
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,710
- In the the now "correct account",

305
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,693
so the new, the criminal
account, where was this located?

306
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,310
- That was actually
located in another country.

307
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,683
It was located in the
Netherlands instead of Poland.

308
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,330
Maybe some alarm bells
should have gone off here.

309
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,370
It didn't,

310
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,883
because obviously
companies can change bank.

311
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,400
That happens from time to time.

312
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:35,970
And we just went ahead
and paid to the bank

313
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,070
in the Netherlands without any questions.

314
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,130
And also of course, we confirmed

315
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,140
that now we had paid
to the "right account".

316
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,939
- So at this point, you
authorize the transaction

317
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,870
and your accounting
sends in a confirmation

318
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,840
to the criminals, thinking
they are the supplier

319
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,940
that we fixed the mistakes.

320
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,220
We have now paid everything.

321
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,300
Everything should be fine.

322
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,132
- Yes.

323
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,830
So now both parties
think that they've done

324
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,570
what they should, and
that everything is fine.

325
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,610
- Perfect.

326
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,693
Then I think I have one question here.

327
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,020
Because I think there's someone

328
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,100
who may be missing their money here.

329
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,933
- Correct.

330
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,770
So after a couple of days,

331
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,333
our supplier starts
asking where's the money?

332
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,770
We have reversed it, and you
promise to pay it back to us

333
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,923
to the right account and
from the right account.

334
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,760
And now we're talking
about a real supplier.

335
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,610
They are asking questions,
where is our money?

336
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,080
- And who are they now talking to?

337
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,030
- Now, they're talking to
our accounting department.

338
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,680
And our accounting department,
they're not compromised.

339
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,920
Their email accounts is controlled

340
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,823
by our accounting department.

341
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,640
And after awhile, both
our accounting department

342
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,819
and our senior director realizes

343
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,220
that, oh, we have paid
to the wrong account.

344
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,990
And that is actually the topic
on one of the emails sent

345
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,180
in our organization with capital letters.

346
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,740
We have paid to the wrong account.

347
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,740
- And can I ask how long
after the actual payout

348
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,419
to the criminals, did you guys

349
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,703
and the supplier realize
that, oh, it's that moment.

350
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:25,560
- It was about five business days.

351
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,099
So just around a week.

352
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,899
Because of course being
transactions through banks

353
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,530
in various countries,
you expect some delays,

354
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,793
but after a week, where is the money?

355
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,112
So then the alarm bells goes off.

356
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,230
And luckily for us,

357
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,880
we were able through our bank,

358
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,670
to stop or to freeze the payment done

359
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,970
to the Netherlands bank.

360
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,470
We never communicated with
any of the other banks,

361
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,380
but we had good
communication with our bank.

362
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,803
And they were able to do that.

363
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,010
It wasn't easy and it didn't go quickly,

364
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,960
but we were able to freeze it at least.

365
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,330
But some chance of luck,
it was before the criminals

366
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,439
had gotten around getting the money,

367
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,423
either taken out or
transferred to another bank.

368
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,550
- And then, what about police?

369
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,690
- We involved police both
in Norway and in Poland.

370
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,700
But as you mentioned in the introduction,

371
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,130
the amount of this,

372
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,650
kind of where a compromise is, it's huge.

373
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,403
So they took it seriously.

374
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,163
We provided a lot of
information on both sides.

375
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,600
But of course, this is
not easy to investigate

376
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,533
for the police.

377
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,670
It's a fake email domain,

378
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,200
hard to find out who registered it.

379
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,140
They operate from multiple sites.

380
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,390
You don't really know where people are

381
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,160
and they're on the internet.

382
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,210
So, the police was involved,

383
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,200
and it helped us

384
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,490
to convince the Dutch bank,

385
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,480
because that was also a
part of it that wasn't easy.

386
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,930
They froze the payment,
but of course for them,

387
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,640
it might actually seem
like a legit payment.

388
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,930
So why should they reverse it?

389
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,140
They asked the same
question as the Polish bank,

390
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,690
they didn't start off the case.

391
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,597
But eventually we got through the heist.

392
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:26,150
- So you got all the cash back.

393
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,660
- Yes, it took some time
we got some cash back.

394
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,160
And then after a while,

395
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,450
we actually got the whole amount back.

396
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,270
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

397
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,810
- Very few business
email compromise victims

398
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,100
that we work with actually
get their funds returned.

399
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,149
So this is huge.

400
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,290
It may actually suggest

401
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,040
that the criminals screwed
up somewhere along the way.

402
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,670
But as we've seen here,

403
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,770
they went through all
the way from the start

404
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,400
through the phishing, get
access, do the research

405
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,010
and then actually get the payout.

406
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,350
So something happened after you authorized

407
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,330
the money transfer and they
probably ran away somewhere.

408
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,723
- Yes, that is I think--
- Their loss not ours.

409
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,562
Very good.

410
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,570
So what can we learn
from this kind of case?

411
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,867
Why are we sharing this, Espen?

412
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,470
- I think we can learn a lot
from these kind of cases.

413
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,650
First of all, as you said,
why are we sharing this?

414
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,290
I think we can learn that
openness around this,

415
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,720
actually makes it easier
for other companies

416
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,293
to not do the same mistakes that we did.

417
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,953
So we were lucky.

418
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,700
Actually we were lucky to find it out

419
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,440
and we were lucky to get
our money back as well.

420
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,050
So for us, this was an eyeopener,

421
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,280
but nothing serious happened in the end.

422
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,133
So that is important.

423
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,920
We also learned that
routines are important.

424
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,820
We learned that

425
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,880
technical aspects of this,
we are able to improve that,

426
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,760
but maybe the focus wasn't right.

427
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,680
We weren't focusing on
that we had challenges

428
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,420
with the technical security,

429
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,950
only our email servers, for example.

430
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,103
So there are multiple learning points.

431
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,689
- So I believe that
language is a crucial thing

432
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,070
when it comes to scams like this.

433
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,610
Imagine two people who do
not speak the same language

434
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,740
and their mother tongues
are very different

435
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,149
in the starting point.

436
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,650
Then these two parties are forced

437
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,460
to speaking a third language.

438
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,750
And even if they speak it very well

439
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,250
from a business perspective,

440
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,490
they may not command it to such an extent

441
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,423
that small nuances may actually get lost.

442
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:55,540
In your case, I think we saw that,

443
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,070
in these two different stories
that the criminal set up.

444
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,590
Both of them talking
about the wrong account.

445
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,449
So that's a keyword.

446
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,220
That's what you hear.

447
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,883
But it was two kinds of wrong accounts.

448
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,410
We paid to the wrong account

449
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,440
and we paid from the wrong account,

450
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,323
depending on who you
were communicating with.

451
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,090
And that kind of nuance
is very easy to lose

452
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,570
in translation.

453
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,230
- I think you're absolutely right there.

454
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,843
And, I think as well that,

455
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,129
the other factor here,

456
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,970
that we should learn
from is that they used

457
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,203
the stress rut.

458
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,840
- And stress is very fascinating.

459
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,820
So, we know Daniel Khaneman, for example,

460
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,810
in his book, "Thinking Fast and Slow"

461
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,710
where he talks about,

462
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,900
how when we concentrate, slow things down

463
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,560
and try to find the
answers while normally,

464
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,760
or especially in stressful
situation which was a key here,

465
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,510
we automatically go into automation mode.

466
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,020
The thinking fast.

467
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,530
It sounds like thinking
fast is a great thing,

468
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,370
but in these kind of stories, it's not.

469
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,620
It's actually the enemy of great.

470
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,699
Because what happens your mind
goes into automation mode,

471
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,840
and then you just do things,

472
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,372
instead of thinking through
things before you do them.

473
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,710
Espen, we are running out of time now,

474
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,230
but we promised the participants
here to get something

475
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,590
to bring home.

476
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,590
So what should the participants
do in the next 30 days?

477
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,810
- I think at least the most
important thing you can do

478
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,810
is to start reviewing your
current policies and practices.

479
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,540
Because obviously, I
guess, in all scam cases

480
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,460
and phishing attempts,

481
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,350
they utilize weaknesses in your policies

482
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,439
and in your frameworks
and how we do things.

483
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,810
So you need to start
looking at how we do things

484
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,320
and you need to start ensuring

485
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,460
that people do things according to

486
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,280
the current framework
or the current policy.

487
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,710
In our case, for example,

488
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,081
we saw that we never did
out of band verification

489
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,610
when they started to discuss
different banking details.

490
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,719
We trusted the communication in the email.

491
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,950
- I had to interrupt you here.

492
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,760
I see that you, that's
you, have this question,

493
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,080
what do we mean by out
of band communication?

494
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,010
- So, out of band communication,

495
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,560
we talk about, using a
different communication channel.

496
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,440
There's no point of verifying
something back to the email,

497
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,500
to the sender of the email,
because as in this case,

498
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,390
that was the criminal.

499
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,490
You need to pick up the phone for example,

500
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,600
and don't call the number in the email,

501
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,629
because that is always also fake.

502
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,770
Call the number on their
official website, for example,

503
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,100
and talk to the people
you usually talk to,

504
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,500
making them confirm that they have changed

505
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,800
the banking details.

506
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,310
I think that is key.

507
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,250
And that is out of band verification.

508
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,880
- Thank you for that clarification.

509
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,900
And for you who are listening to this,

510
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,240
that kind of changes in your policies,

511
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,873
you can apply right away.

512
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,770
What else should we be doing?

513
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,510
- I think, we should do
something you know a lot about,

514
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,340
measuring and training
and assessing our people.

515
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,100
Because our people here
is probably the weak link

516
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,199
or where we can improve.

517
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,920
- Or the strong link as I like to use,

518
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,123
the human firewall.

519
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,250
But in order for them to
become human firewalls,

520
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,060
we need to figure out where they are,

521
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,780
including their weaknesses so
that we, as an organization,

522
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,653
can improve and build them
as strong as they need to be.

523
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,500
In the first part, measuring you can do,

524
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,883
I mean, this month,
get up, just do it now.

525
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,729
But the training will
take a little longer.

526
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,563
- Absolutely.

527
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,220
And that is what we have seen as well.

528
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,080
We are able to measure
as you said, quickly.

529
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,260
But training is hard.

530
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,670
Training need to be targeted

531
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,330
and you need to train the correct way

532
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,909
and your employees might not be interested

533
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,410
in being trained in this kind of things.

534
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,470
So then we should also
look into technical things.

535
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,420
What can we do from the technical side?

536
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:20,490
And then implementing a
multifactor authentication

537
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,693
on your email system is,

538
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,639
I'm not going to say easy,

539
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,400
but at least it's a low hanging fruit

540
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,060
and you should do it within six months max

541
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,050
from this talk.

542
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,090
- And although my colleague,
Roger Grimes will tell you

543
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,949
that multifactor authentication
is not 100% security.

544
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,170
If you don't use it,

545
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,120
it's going to improve
your security by a lot.

546
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,600
- Yeah, of course.

547
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
And I think in this case,

548
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,290
it would have made it much
more difficult, not impossible,

549
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,572
but much more difficult for
the criminal to do the scam.

550
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,679
- So thank you so much for
joining me on this talk, Espen.

551
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,030
It's been great.

552
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,560
I know that we have some
questions from the audience,

553
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,820
which we have been trying

554
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,763
to answer using the chat.

555
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,020
So, with that, I think it's
time for us to say thank you.

556
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,610
And I hope that you have
learned something today.

557
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,080
Feel free to reach out
to both me and the Espen.

558
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,960
We are here to help you.

559
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,680
We can't guarantee that you
will avoid these things,

560
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,420
but obviously we will love talking to you,

561
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,050
if it happens to you.

562
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,210
Bye bye.

563
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,043
Goodbye.
