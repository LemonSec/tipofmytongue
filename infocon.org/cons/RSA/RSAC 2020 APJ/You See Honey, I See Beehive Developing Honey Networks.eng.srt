00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,000
- Hello and welcome to You
See Honey, I See Beehive,

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,300
Developing Honey Networks.

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,759
If you're joining us live,

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,150
our speaker is in the
Slido chat discussion

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,470
answering your questions right now.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,150
For audio video issues,

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,558

support button below.

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,140
I'd like to now turn
it over to Joseph Muniz

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,223
for the presentation.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,118
- Good morning, good
afternoon, good evening

11
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:42,845
wherever you're at in the world.

12
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,537
As she said, my name is Joseph Muniz

13
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:49,530
and this is You See Honey, I See Beehives,

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,063
Developing Honey Networks.

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,990
First off, why care about this?

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,400
What's the point of spending
this short time with me?

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,800
Well, I'll summarize it like this.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,462
Basically any security expert

19
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:08,370
will tell you that it
is a cat and mouse game

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,395
when it comes to attack and defend.

21
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:14,339
What I mean by that is things
are constantly changing.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,130
You cannot, as I call it, ambulance chase.

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,085
You can't say, oh my God,

24
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:21,423
I need to defend against this threat today

25
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:23,979
because things are constantly changing.

26
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,990
We've seen this throughout
the time of computers,

27
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,809
pretty much, where computers came out

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,830
and the attackers would start to realize

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,350
these are viable resources
and try to compromise those.

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,940
As the defenders developed techniques,

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,780
the attackers would basically
switch to different targets.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,070
Let's try the internet browser,

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,250
which is still, by the way,
super vulnerable today.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,640
A tool I like is the
Browser Injection Framework

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,473
known as BIF.

36
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:54,340
It finds vulnerable browsers
and you can run exploits.

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,709
But even with browsers,
the attackers figured out,

38
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,860
oh, there's plugins.

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,510
And about 2008 or nine,

40
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,680
you had the golden era of
Flash and Java exploits.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,640
And the point is this, things
are constantly changing.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,225
So the purpose of today's talk

43
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,470
is to think about the attacks of tomorrow

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,800
and prepare you by basically developing

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,850
a defense and depth strategy.

46
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,863
So the assumption is you have firewalls,

47
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,260
you have anti-virus,

48
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,600
you have these traditional security tools,

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,000
but what is a true way
to do defensive depth

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,120
and particularly breach detection

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,883
in order to prevent the
attacks of tomorrow?

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,090
Now, as I said, my name is Joseph Muniz.

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,370
I work at Cisco, but I also
am a security researcher.

54
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,840
So I have my blog, thesecurityblogger.com,

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,670
I have a bunch of publications.

56
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,380
I have two new books coming out.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,030
One is on a new security
operation center book for Pearson,

58
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,934
and then one is for Cisco Press.

59
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,250
If you haven't heard Cisco has changed

60
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,920
their certification program

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,399
and I'm doing the training for the VPN.

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,341
So the SVPN exam, I have
that book coming out as well.

63
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,230
You can follow me on my Twitter.

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,519
So this is basically
who I am and what I do.

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,780
Again I'm here alive to receive questions.

66
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,420
You can reach out about today's talk

67
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,630
as well as anything security,
attack, defend related

68
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,010
and I'd be happy to
talk to you about that.

69
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,600
But let's move into the
actual conversation at hand,

70
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,000
which is what I'm focusing
on is breach detection.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,400
I say this because I assume
that you have a firewall,

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,960
anti-virus, the traditional tools.

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,930
And that's fine,

74
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,170
but we've seen these tools
fail time after time again.

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,829
And I mean, yeah, a firewall
anti-virus detection tools

76
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,090
can work at times,

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,644
but all you need is the
right social networking

78
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:42,000
or the right malware using
like a packing technique

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,081
or encoding technique that
your tools don't detect

80
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,000
and you will have a failure.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,191
We see it time and again,

82
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:52,010
you need to be thinking
beyond just the edge defense

83
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,100
and that's where the focus of today's talk

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,530
is really gonna show value

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,940
is not only validating those tools

86
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,650
are working or not working,

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,210
but also giving you a proper
way to respond, identify,

88
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,060
and then be able to deal with a breach.

89
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,420
So I find when I talk to customers

90
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,140
that a lot of them are
hyperfocused on the wrong things.

91
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,500
Again, I keep throwing out terms,

92
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,899
network access control,
firewall, anti-virus.

93
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,630
All important tools, but
they focused on the attack

94
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,790
and the attack is not
the actual threat here.

95
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,180
It's not the actual problem.

96
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,320
It's the results of the attack,
it's what's being delivered.

97
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,610
So imagine this exploit
happens, what's next?

98
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,750
Well, it's typically
ransomware or a backdoor

99
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,960
or a remote access tool, RAT.

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,810
It's some bad stuff,

101
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,830
and that's what people
tend to be blind on.

102
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,719
That's where they tend to fail

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,144
because it gets challenging
to scale breach detection

104
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:49,400
across all parts of the network.

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,900
I mean, think about the
cloud, the internal network,

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,866
the data center.

107
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,246
Right now, we're all at home.

108
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,479
We all have our internal home networks.

109
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,990
How do you scale breach detection?

110
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,640
This Phantom network
approach I'm gonna talk about

111
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,349
is a end-to-end host and network approach

112
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,790
that can actually scale

113
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,430
as well as provide this
true breach detection,

114
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,683
and that's the value of this talk.

115
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,120
Now it's not about blocking.

116
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,150
It's about time reduction.

117
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,659
So assume that other tools I mentioned

118
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,952
are all about blocking,
but when they fail,

119
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:25,030
you need to basically determine
that happened and respond.

120
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,530
Any industry report, whether
it's a variety security report

121
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,830
or whatever it may say

122
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,870
uses the term weeks,
months, and even years

123
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,740
to determine the time of response,
which is not good enough.

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,550
My goal and the focus of this
is to bring it down to hours.

125
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,142
So I'm talking about
dramatic time reduction

126
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,210
to improve your response,

127
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,150
hence an effective breach
detection approach.

128
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,929
Now it can be awfully complicated.

129
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,590
What I'm suggesting is keep it simple.

130
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,969
So the main focus that I
would say is reconnaissance.

131
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,420
Because if you think about it, if malware,

132
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,250
if a insider threat, if
somebody breaks into something,

133
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,546
they don't know what
they have access to now.

134
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:12,140
And what that means is they
need to do reconnaissance.

135
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,229
So by focusing on that behavior,

136
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,370
that allows a simple way to determine

137
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,200
that you have some unusual activity.

138
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,127
Whether it's a IOT
device that's compromised

139
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,220
or whatever it may be,

140
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,320
that has basically breached your network.

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,710
So I will focus on other
detection capabilities,

142
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,440
but reconnaissance is definitely a key one

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,793
and a simple way to determine
that you have been breached.

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,149
Now, if you look at the industry,

145
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:40,630
whether it's any main
guideline, NIST, ISO,

146
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,430
whatever guideline's out there,

147
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,700
and you say, I need breach detection,

148
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,120
these are the kind of capabilities

149
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,930
that they're gonna talk about.

150
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,760
Again, it's not gonna be a firewall

151
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,969
that's controlling ports and protocols.

152
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,420
It's not gonna be network access control.

153
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,727
That's more about allowing
things on the network,

154
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,650
and it has no care about what they do

155
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,150
while they're on the network.

156
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,768
So if you look at this list,
some of these tools can work,

157
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,789
but there's challenges.

158
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,933
And I would say in my approach,

159
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,320
what I'm gonna talk about now

160
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,180
is about honeypots and NetFlow.

161
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,860
I'm gonna focus on those
two industry capabilities.

162
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,125
And the reason why is
something like a packet capture

163
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,010
or like an IDs, these types of other tools

164
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,890
that could work, they're expensive
and they're hard to scale

165
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,130
because you have to actually
be on a tap or span port

166
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,920
to collect the actual data.

167
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,443
And that's a challenge because

168
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:34,919
in a data center cloud, a large network,

169
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,480
how many of these span
ports and taps you deploy?

170
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,950
And that becomes a challenge
where if you go that approach,

171
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,030
you're gonna have blind spots.

172
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,979
So I'm recommending a NetFlow
and honeypot approach,

173
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,760
which I'm titling as the
honey network approach,

174
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,110
because it can scale and
it can actually be real.

175
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,620
It can be affordable.

176
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,480
So looking at a network diagram,

177
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,940
this is me throwing together
a generic branch network.

178
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,390
I'm showing you the focus area,

179
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,520
which is the inside network.

180
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,030
All the gateway stuff I don't
care about or end point.

181
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,981
And I bring this point up as well,

182
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,940
because if you just do
a end point approach

183
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,310
like a honeypot approach,

184
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,100
well, you can only put those

185
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,490
in certain parts of the network.

186
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,861
If you just do a network approach,

187
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:19,500
what happens if the attacker

188
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,230
doesn't basically scan multiple networks,

189
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,260
they may not trip one of your areas.

190
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,190
So my belief

191
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,270
and what I've been deploying
at customer networks

192
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,770
is this combo approach

193
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,010
to give you the true end-to-end.

194
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,179
The one final concept

195
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,532
before I get into the meat
and potatoes of this talk

196
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,419
is understanding what
we're actually looking at,

197
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,074
how we're actually looking.

198
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:44,710
So most edge technologies
like anti-virus and IPS's

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,660
are heavily signature focused.

200
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,980
So pattern matching, I see this hatch,

201
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,430
or I get this threat feed.

202
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,030
And when I see this alarm.

203
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,860
However, those as I
mentioned, you probably have,

204
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,870
and they're likely to fail
through encoding, polymorphism,

205
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,000
all these attacker techniques.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,550
So my focus by using honeypots and NetFlow

207
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,020
is a combination of anomaly and behavior.

208
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,620
Anomaly means baselining.

209
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
This is more of the NetFlow approach

210
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,550
where I'm gonna baseline the network

211
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,339
and look for unusual behavior.

212
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,569
Behavior is like looking
for reconnaissance.

213
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,209
This may be an unknown threat,
but its behavior is bad.

214
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,010
Now it's key to know that these two

215
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,270
are heavily complimentary of each other

216
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,088
because attackers know
when they breach a network,

217
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,880
it's like, oh, I'm inside
this unknown environment.

218
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,100
There's probably security
tools in here looking for me.

219
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,610
So they're gonna use stealth.

220
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,790
And what's awesome is the
more stealth they use,

221
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,719
the more of anomaly they become.

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,052
So by trying to beat
the behavior capability,

223
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,890
they're gonna actually
stand out as an anomaly.

224
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,850
And if they don't try to use stealth,

225
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,710
they're gonna stand out and
be caught as a behavior piece.

226
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,270
So again, it's another reason

227
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,103
why I'm not just talking

228
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,500
about Phantom networks or honeypots,

229
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,505
but the combination is

230
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:58,051
I'm combining anomaly
behavior capabilities

231
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:00,485
to give you a true
defensive depth approach,

232
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:02,198
again, that can scale.

233
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,020
So let's get into it.

234
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,050
Part one, Phantom networks.

235
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,650
So a Phantom network is essentially,

236
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,220
the way I'm defining
this, is using NetFlow.

237
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,191
Now, Netflow's been around for a while

238
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,000
and there's different forms of NetFlow.

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,528
My recommendation is to have
the most data rich NetFlow,

240
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,900
NetFlow 9.

241
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,377
And the reason why is because

242
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:24,400
you can see the who, what, when, where.

243
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,060
You can actually get those details

244
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,780
to understand that you have a problem.

245
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,839
Using a less chatty or a
less informative NetFlow

246
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,770
won't give you the same results.

247
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,218
Also understand IN the world of NetFlow

248
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:40,290
that just because you have the data,

249
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,510
doesn't mean anything.

250
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,199
You can collect logs and have those,

251
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,630
but you get absolutely no value

252
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,670
unless there's some intelligence involved.

253
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,069
So certain NetFlow tools,

254
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,550
I don't want a vendor bash here,

255
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,670
because certain vendors are
really good at what they do,

256
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,319
but they just don't do security.

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,160
One example will be like SolarWinds.

258
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,319
It's really good at doing
the peaks and valleys,

259
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,284
determining if you have RAT problems,

260
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,660
fixing your telephony network,

261
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,900
but they're not necessarily
focused on security,

262
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,790
which is identifying malware,
worms, insider threats.

263
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,540
So you definitely wanna
have the right tool.

264
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,122
It's not just having NetFlow,

265
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,370
it's having the right NetFlow

266
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,900
and the way to use the NetFlow.

267
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,790
Now I would say sampled flow,

268
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,959
any type of sampled
NetFlow is not good enough.

269
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,700
It's not gonna work for this approach.

270
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,750
You're gonna get an alarm

271
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,320
that says something's
happened in the last 24 hours,

272
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,310
and that's just not that valuable.

273
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,882
So my recommendation, NetFlow 9.

274
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:38,910
There are vendors out
there that offer converters

275
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,270
that could convert raw traffic to NetFlow.

276
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,856
And if you have questions again I'm here.

277
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:45,180
Message me in the chat

278
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,410
and I will be able to respond to that.

279
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,770
Also know that most modern
tools support NetFlow today.

280
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,569
I get questions about performance.

281
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,210
It shouldn't really be a major important

282
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,630
performance increase,

283
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,580
unless like you already are tapped out.

284
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,704
And this is that as they say,

285
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,479
the straw that broke the
camel's back type deal,

286
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,273
where this last little thing's
gonna break the system.

287
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,761
Now, really what I'm talking about here,

288
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,964
when I say NetFlow,

289
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,020
yeah, there are a lot of
different detection mechanisms,

290
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,071
but what's kind of cool is,

291
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,200
and what a lot of my
customers don't know about

292
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,150
until I informed them of this concept

293
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,510
that we're talking about is

294
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,558
you could actually create fake networks,

295
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,314
which I call Phantom networks

296
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:27,860
and basically have them
as a detection tripwire.

297
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,022
So the idea is, as I said,
reconnaissance is the focus.

298
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,660
If somebody does reconnaissance and trips

299
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,339
or tickles one of those networks,

300
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,380
an alarm will go off

301
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,750
because nobody should be
interacting with those networks.

302
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,430
They're fake, they're Phantom.

303
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,810
And the idea is you can stand up

304
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,031
as many of these as you want.

305
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,160
So it allows you to create a deception

306
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,089
between what's real and what's not,

307
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,910
where an attacker as doing reconnaissance

308
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,630
will likely hit the network.

309
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,770
That's the idea.

310
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,420
Now I have done this as well
by looking at existing networks

311
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,510
and looking at crossing between networks.

312
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,080
So I would say like a
classified unclassified,

313
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
and you can say if a
traffic from the classified

314
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,640
ever goes to the
non-classified, also an alarm.

315
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,490
I've seen situations
where my customers say

316
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,190
thou shalt, that there will
be no, it's not happening.

317
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,900
And then you actually
monitor with this approach

318
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,840
and you find that there
is an old exception

319
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,010
in the firewall list

320
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,860
that's actually allowing traffic to happen

321
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,580
and an attacker is
taken advantage of that.

322
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,170
So it does happen.

323
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,546
But for this particular
purpose, the easiest way,

324
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,670
one other way is using my
Phantom network approach,

325
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,740
which is creating the fake networks.

326
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,630
Here are some examples of
customers using this approach.

327
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,770
One is I can't give the
details of this one,

328
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,650
but you can get the
high level understanding

329
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,770
that in a DISA based network,

330
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,800
there was an X-ray
machine doing port scans,

331
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,569
trying to find other networks.

332
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,020
And by doing that reconnaissance,

333
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,170
they tripped over one
of the Phantom networks.

334
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,411
The phantom network was like,
why you port scanning me,

335
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,719
because we'll talk about white listing

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,147
and vulnerability scanners,

337
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,860
versus actual malicious activities,

338
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,800
but an IP address that
was not authorized to scan

339
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,420
scanned one of the tripwires

340
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,170
and we were able to find it.

341
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,449
Same one as another customer
example with using Splunk

342
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,510
and pulling in Phantom information

343
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,620
and basically once an alarm went off,

344
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,580
you'd click and open up the the widget,

345
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,890
which I'll talk about making
those in a few minutes

346
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,564
and you can see the
details of what's going on.

347
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:22,180
So that's an extremely effective approach.

348
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,724
I would say if you have
concerns of false positives,

349
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,410
while things are most common one

350
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,850
will be like a port scanner or something,

351
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,080
or I'm sorry, a vulnerability scanner,

352
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,580
and you need to white list the tools

353
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,120
that do security scanning.

354
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,870
So it's basically anything

355
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,272
that's not expected to be doing scanning.

356
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:41,180
I'll also talk about a little
later, right integrations

357
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,540
where you can even integrate
with an access control

358
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,510
or packet capture tool to give
you some other cool things.

359
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,500
But that's really the
summary of Phantom network.

360
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,860
It's part one of those talk,
but there are limitations.

361
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,830
One limitation.

362
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,127
Let's say that I'm going
to attack a network

363
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,949
and I don't wanna just scan everything

364
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,609
'cause again, I'm afraid that
I don't know where I'm at,

365
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,610
I don't wanna trigger a security alarm,

366
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,490
so I'm gonna be tactical with my scanning.

367
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,900
I may not trigger a Phantom network.

368
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,750
And that's where part two
comes in, which is honeypots.

369
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,800
Now honeypots have been
around for a while.

370
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,579
This is gonna be a shorter explanation

371
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,856
'cause I assume you've
heard of a honeypot.

372
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,750
But I'll say for this purpose,

373
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,390
think of it as three
different types of honeypots,

374
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,923
low, medium and high interactive.

375
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,671
Low interactive means it's just there

376
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:28,970
to pick up on seeing scanning,

377
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,820
which is completely cool
and simple to deploy.

378
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,980
Media means you can allow
the attacker to log in,

379
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,110
but then you don't really
give a lot of resources.

380
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,190
And that's also, I would say fine.

381
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,580
The high one is the full
interactive almost sandbox

382
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,153
where the attacker could interact.

383
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:47,233
To me, unless you wanna
learn about the attacker,

384
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,000
and you have other goals

385
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,862
for the honey network deception
approach I'm talking about

386
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:54,400
keeping it simple as
probably the easiest route,

387
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,770
which is placing simple honeypots

388
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,319
that look for the reconnaissance activity.

389
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,113
Now you have to think
persona with this approach

390
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:04,160
'cause again, you're
creating a Phantom network.

391
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,010
So I would think on a network,

392
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,930
do you wanna use IOT devices
to basically be the Phantom,

393
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,000
find a IOT based honeypot

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,701
and there's many of these
open source simple honeypots

395
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,760
that can give you that value.

396
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,770
So think persona as you build
out this Phantom network,

397
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,780
and I would say low or medium
interactive, makes sense.

398
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,000
But if you're not, please pay attention

399
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,040
if you're not paying attention right now.

400
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,199
Huge warning.

401
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,510
Do not just go to YouTube and just,

402
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,380
oh, I know some 13 year
old blasting the matrix

403
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,530
with acne problem says,
here's how to do this

404
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,670
and follow their directions.

405
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,276
What we find is every once in a while,

406
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:41,980
and this is my job now at Cisco,

407
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,170
if we're using an incident response team,

408
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,170
sometimes it happens because
a person has used YouTube

409
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,480
and misconfigured a device

410
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,270
and allowed the threat on the network.

411
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,079
So for example, you put a honeypot,

412
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
which is a vulnerable system,

413
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,940
and then give a outside IP address.

414
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,690
That's called in the industry,
a resume generating event,

415
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,609
meaning you're gonna get yourself fired

416
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,189
if your company is spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars

417
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,319
to bring an incident response team out

418
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,079
to find out you infected yourself.

419
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,949
So if you don't know what you're doing,

420
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,782
I'll mention some vendors

421
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,139
and you can also, again,
message me here live

422
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,031
and I will give you recommendations

423
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:21,659
of enterprise tools that
would reduce the risk

424
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,098
because a lot of the things
are built correctly for you.

425
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:28,600
So looking at the honeypot usage.

426
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,860
Basically to summarize, I
would say high interactive ones

427
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,939
are not necessarily
needed for this approach.

428
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,090
So low or medium interactive ones.

429
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,330
I would say also understand

430
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,560
if you're gonna use a
more interactive honeypot,

431
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,250
you're gonna get a lot more alarms.

432
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,920
Where you're gonna find in part three,

433
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,037
the final part of my short talk here

434
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:50,550
is that I'm all about
simplicity and quick value add.

435
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,915
And by adding a lot of additional
alarms and information,

436
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:57,020
you may dilute the value add

437
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,750
'cause you'll basically
be causing confusion.

438
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,140
Also one final key piece
before we move on is

439
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,941
do not forget about your honeypots.

440
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:07,651
We see at times people
start a project like this,

441
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:09,310
put all these systems,

442
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,450
but don't actually assign management.

443
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,734
And then what happens is
you have a warning system

444
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,449
that nobody's looking at it anymore

445
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,150
and just sitting here on the network.

446
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,560
That's also bad as well.

447
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,919
So being strategic about
the usage of honeypots.

448
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,450
So, again (poor connectivity
drowns out voice)

449
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,020
it's an insider threat trip wire,

450
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,353
but it's not a wire, it's
an end point tripwire.

451
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,936
And by combining this with
the Phantom network approach

452
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:34,312
that I'm gonna talk about
now, for part three,

453
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,890
you can basically scale
this via end-to-end.

454
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,200
Now, a couple of final tips here is,

455
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,855
think about tuning as well as think about

456
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,950
the attacker's point of view.

457
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,030
Now, as I mentioned, Phantom networks

458
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,356
is a newer concept

459
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:50,050
than the one I'm bring
it to you right now,

460
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,000
but honeypots is definitely
not a newer concept.

461
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,833
With that being said,

462
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,425
if an attacker is going to do
anti-detection capabilities,

463
00:18:57,425 --> 00:19:00,350
they're gonna basically try to use

464
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,800
some of those monitoring,
beaconing and stealth techniques,

465
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
but the Phantom network
approach overcomes that.

466
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,840
But when it comes to honeypots,

467
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,129
there are already detectors

468
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,662
that will detect if it's a honeypot.

469
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:14,730
And one example I'm showing here is

470
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,343
you can use Cali Linux
and download Metasploit

471
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,720
and look for, this is an example

472
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,230
of running the kippo honeypot detector.

473
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,120
Now, even though it's a kippo detector,

474
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,939
it can actually detect
other honeypots as well.

475
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,800
So my recommendation is when
you build your honeypots

476
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,004
try downloading Cali, use no
Metaspoilt that's built in

477
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,940
and try using some of these detectors.

478
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,780
Don't make it easy for the attacker.

479
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,230
Make sure at least your
honeypots look like real devices.

480
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,490
And this is again just some
recommendations that you can do

481
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,940
as you do your initial setup.

482
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,980
With that being said
with my last 10 minutes,

483
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,240
we get to the final topic here,

484
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,090
which is the total deception topic.

485
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,639
So to summarize thus far,

486
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,110
what I'm talking about
is breach detection,

487
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,139
looking for the threats of tomorrow.

488
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm talking about doing this

489
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,900
and scaling this across
any type of network,

490
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,550
virtual, cloud, it doesn't matter,

491
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,350
and being able to do
this in a simplistic way

492
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,129
where when your initial defenses fail,

493
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,960
you have a way to detect it.

494
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,500
I believe his approach
is extremely effective

495
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,457
because first you have the
Phantom network approach.

496
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:23,060
Allows you to create as many
fake networks as you want.

497
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,470
And when somebody trips that network,

498
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,590
you can get the alarm

499
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,310
and know that there's a breach
within that network segment

500
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,919
and be able to then do your response.

501
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,500
I also believe that there
are gaps in this approach.

502
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,610
I admit to what I know

503
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,610
and that's where I'm not just here

504
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,860
talking about Phantom networks.

505
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,734
But I believe the honeypot approach

506
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,970
is a strong method to fill those gaps.

507
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,030
So if you're in a data center

508
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,629
that doesn't have multiple networks,

509
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,060
you can still throw virtual
servers more or less.

510
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,778
That could be the persona honeypots

511
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:51,438
in that piece of the network.

512
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,267
Now, as you scale this by recommendation,

513
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:55,750
you definitely need a SIEM

514
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,160
or some centralized
piece of taking the logs.

515
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,166
It's not about logging
into multiple tools.

516
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,557
Again, it's about simple value add.

517
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:05,250
And you basically having
a good incident response

518
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,120
means being able to
consolidate all the data

519
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,060
so you can actually review
it and respond to it.

520
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,500
So I would say you would need

521
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,940
some kind of centralized
SIEM soar XDR type tool

522
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,360
to take in those logs.

523
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,959
And then from there you can
determine and/or honeypot.

524
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,950
So put some honeypots
on the Phantom network,

525
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,490
put some within your real network

526
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,444
and have the Phantom
networks spread throughout.

527
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,399
Now you have total deception.

528
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,850
It doesn't matter day zero
or whatever the attack is,

529
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,437
reconnaissance, as I keep harping on,

530
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,290
is an activity that the
attackers are gonna do

531
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,460
as well as they're gonna do

532
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,880
other internal monitoring of a network,

533
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,403
which these detection
points will determine

534
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:44,890
when somebody is inside your network.

535
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,609
Now to make it even jucier,

536
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,750
some things I've done
for some of my customers

537
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,280
is integration with response tools.

538
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,960
The two most common I've done is

539
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,790
either using a packet capture tool,

540
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,379
so it could be like a net witness,

541
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,230
or it could be some other type of tool

542
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,652
or a script that watches a TCP dump,

543
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,905
or integrating with like an enterprise

544
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,857
access control solution.

545
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,720
It could be FortiNAC it can be Forescout,

546
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,050
it can be a Cisco ISE doesn't matter.

547
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,211
The industry vendors that
are enterprise capable

548
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:14,626
tend to have APIs

549
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,131
and they tend to do basically

550
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:20,120
the ability to do quarantining.

551
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,939
Now to be crystal clear

552
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,504
quarantining does not mean

553
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:25,463
kicking something off the network.

554
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:27,780
For most of my customers
they're afraid of that.

555
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,770
They're afraid of causing that problem

556
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,200
and causing the whole
project to look awful.

557
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,770
So quarantine can mean
reducing network access,

558
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,440
putting them on a guest network

559
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,127
so as the incident response is occurring,

560
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,310
the threat at least has been isolated

561
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,550
away from the sensitive data
center and other things.

562
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,120
And this is something that's been around

563
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,699
for the last five years is
integration with NAC solutions

564
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,870
with SIEMS to respond to big events.

565
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,469
So I'll build literally
that type of integration

566
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,303
within the SIEM

567
00:22:57,303 --> 00:23:00,270
using the APIs that again
have been around for a while.

568
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,260
If you're unfamiliar message me.

569
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,220
I'm happy to give you some white papers

570
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,000
and talk about these integrations.

571
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,240
This is what I do and as you
can see, I like what I do.

572
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,673
Now to summarize the components.

573
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:15,110
At the very beginning of
it was the NetFlow tool

574
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,270
that I understand a lot
of you may not have.

575
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,360
And that's the idea of
creating Phantom networks.

576
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,850
Cisco StealthWatch, Plixer

577
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,469
are two examples of
security focused vendors,

578
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,930
but there are also other ways of doing it

579
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,550
with open source tools.

580
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,139
And then on the end
point side is honeypots

581
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,220
which there's hundreds of them out there.

582
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,310
I can throw out enterprise
vendors like TrapX

583
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,554
that do really cool things,

584
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,060
or you can keep it simple

585
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,540
and pick a open source like
I wanna simulate an IOT

586
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,270
that's hanging thing as an example.

587
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,536
So there's many open source options

588
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:50,810
that also could work there
as well for that value.

589
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,899
Finally, I heavily, heavily, heavily

590
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,780
suggest a centralized tool.

591
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,591
Whether it's SIEM SOAR,
XDR you need something

592
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:58,810
to take in the logs.

593
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,714
You're not going to log into each device.

594
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:04,790
And then as you develop value,
then think about responses,

595
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,007
which maybe you integrate
with a packet capture tool

596
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:09,830
and/or network access control solution

597
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,149
to automate the response

598
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,116
to really give you a cool
end-to-end incident response,

599
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:18,363
as well as a breach
detection offering here.

600
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,510
So here's just some final tips
on how to make this all work.

601
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,600
First off, when you use honeypots,

602
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,629
you need to collect the data.

603
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,090
You don't wanna be monitoring
the honeypot directly.

604
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,129
So if I'm using Splunk or QRadar,

605
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,218
we'll use Splunk as it's example,

606
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,440
you need to have some kind of exporter.

607
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,467
So it could be Splunk stream,
Splunk universal forwarder.

608
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,160
Splunk has been around for a while,

609
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,510
they have many exporters.

610
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,560
You need that inside the
honeypot to get the alarms.

611
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,330
Then you wanna filter out all the crap.

612
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,600
Because again, I'm all about simplicity

613
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,889
and quick to value-add.

614
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,260
So all inbound activity doesn't matter

615
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,410
because it's a fake system.

616
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,520
There's no value coming from the honeypot.

617
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,905
It's a fake system, just
looking for the insider threat.

618
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:03,670
However, you may wanna have the
medium interactive honeypot.

619
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,030
That's totally cool.

620
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,324
If you wanna do that, I would still say

621
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:09,400
simplify the triggers.

622
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,710
Don't look for every
single alarm from there.

623
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,590
I'm giving you examples of
the top six I would recommend

624
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,010
'cause these are the things
that typically happen.

625
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,180
You log in as an attacker
to a compromised system,

626
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,190
and you're gonna modify files

627
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,260
or maybe a hide your
history is pretty common,

628
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,400
or you do a W getting downloaded
your tool kits and stuff.

629
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,160
So look for a couple of things
like that, and that's it.

630
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,750
Keep it simple and that's it.

631
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,030
From the NetFlow tool,

632
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,732
you're just having the NetFlow tool

633
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:38,020
send your alarms or logs to the SIEM,

634
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,566
and once the data is in the SIEM,

635
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,640
then you can do your tuning.

636
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,959
Now for me and my customers,

637
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,604
again, I'm all about simplicity,

638
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:47,620
I would say, just build
a couple simple widgets.

639
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,453
And the way you do this,

640
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:51,041
is you take in all the
logs from your honeypots

641
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,624
and from your NetFlow tool,

642
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:57,624
and you simplify it down to,
wait for it, reconnaissance.

643
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,469
Because again, reconnaissance

644
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:02,660
is likely the activity you're
gonna see from a breach.

645
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,250
There are other things you can do as well

646
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,230
if you wanna see value.

647
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,310
You can see who's the attacker

648
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,270
and create a widget for the IP addresses.

649
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,790
You can maybe do a country
thing if you're interested,

650
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,280
even though I believe personally,

651
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,334
it doesn't matter about
the other countries

652
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,582
where they're coming from,

653
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:20,890
unless you're doing geo-fencing.

654
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,981
But other than that stuff,

655
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,690
it's not about stopping the attacker.

656
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,580
It's about, this is breached,
this is your network.

657
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,500
But you can collect
other interesting facts

658
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,770
is my point as well.

659
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,569
So the goal should be to
translate this to widgets.

660
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,290
When I do this for customers,

661
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,530
it's typically combining the honeypot

662
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,940
and Phantom network or a
NetFlow tool into one widget,

663
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,180
and what do you see reconnaissance,

664
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,130
or focusing down to the reconnaissance,

665
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,520
set off an alarm and then
maybe have another widget

666
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,670
that gives me the IP addresses associated.

667
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,570
So if it happens to be a
new scanner or something,

668
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,939
and you see that you can open a ticket,

669
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,120
somebody says, oh, that's
our vulnerability scanner.

670
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,939
It's simple to understand, respond

671
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,000
and know that that's a false positive.

672
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,422
Finally, you may wanna get some stats.

673
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:07,870
Leadership, love stats,

674
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,560
and you can also collect
some diagrams on it as well.

675
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,679
But I'm harping to keep it simple

676
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,200
versus just dumping all the NetFlow logs

677
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,470
or dumping all the event
logs from your honeypots.

678
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,430
That's not necessarily
gonna give you value add.

679
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,720
Now, typically I do demos a lot more,

680
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,100
but I only have 30 minutes.

681
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,089
So I have to wrap this
up, but like I said,

682
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,860
I'm a text message, a message away.

683
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,459
So we can always take it
offline after this talk.

684
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,380
I'm here live.

685
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,783
Feel free to talk to me.

686
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,728
But for the next steps, I will say,

687
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:39,700
first off my recommendation is

688
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,740
try to develop this Phantom concept.

689
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,830
If you're gonna go after
buying tools, et cetera,

690
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,149
it's gonna be expensive.

691
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,760
The approach I'm talking about here

692
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,188
is acquiring a NetFlow tool.

693
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,273
I understand there's some cost to that,

694
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:52,750
but that's the way it is.

695
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,939
There is some investment
to make this work.

696
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,870
Build that out, try
creating a Phantom network.

697
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,929
Try adding a honeypot and
keep it simple and small.

698
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,540
Then make sure you're getting
the logs and your SIEM.

699
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,899
Start to do the tuning.

700
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,250
So then basically adjust the logs,

701
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,900
just focus on reconnaissance,

702
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,567
create those widgets I'm talking about

703
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,320
create the activity so
you can download AngryIP,

704
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,960
Nmap, Zenmap, whatever it may be

705
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,790
and scan and trigger the alarms

706
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,460
and see how they look inside your SIEMs.

707
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,310
It's the way that I do it when
I do it with my customers.

708
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,139
And then from there, you start to scale

709
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,110
because to be honest,
building it is the hard part.

710
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,649
Scaling it is not hard.

711
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,990
Adding more Phantom networks

712
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,310
or replicating a cloned
honeypot is not that hard.

713
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,669
It's the initial build

714
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,740
that is gonna take you a little more time.

715
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,420
At that point, you assign
somebody to use this,

716
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,600
get some value add,

717
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,070
and then start to think
about building upon that

718
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,700
with your integrations, with
your network access control

719
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,533
and so forth.

720
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,377
And I'll close with this,

721
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,773
security is not a journey,
it's a destination,

722
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,629
you don't become secure.

723
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,530
This is something you're
gonna have to work towards

724
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,430
and threats are constantly changing.

725
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,360
You control buying ideas, try to put it

726
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,722
in some part of the network,

727
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:04,400
but I find that in my customer base

728
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,506
where I see the most success

729
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:07,590
is an easy way, simple way

730
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,129
to get basically breach detection
across the entire network.

731
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:15,100
I feel like the Phantom
network stealth type approach,

732
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,179
where the attacker can't
tell what's real or not,

733
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,350
it's extremely effective and
it doesn't matter the attacks.

734
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,860
So it's preparing you for the
attacks today and tomorrow,

735
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,693
but there are depths.

736
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:26,020
So that's where the
honeypot comes in as well.

737
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,370
We can deploy the honeypots as well.

738
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,684
And with the combined
solution put into a dashboard,

739
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:34,690
you now have a continuously
place to monitor

740
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,053
for breach detection.

741
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,560
Again, my name is Joseph Muniz.

742
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,040
This was a talk on honeypots

743
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,580
and honey networks basically is the talk,

744
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,870
to give you total
deception from end-to-end.

745
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,330
I'm here, if you have questions,

746
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,230
but I truly appreciate your time

747
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,740
and hope that you stay safe
and your security journey.

748
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,940
Thank you for your time.
