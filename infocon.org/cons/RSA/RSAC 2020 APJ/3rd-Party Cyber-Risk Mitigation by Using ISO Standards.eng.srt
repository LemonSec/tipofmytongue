00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,931
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,931

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,793
Willy Fabritius for the presentation.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,669
- Thank you very much for the intro.

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,820
My name is Willy Fabritius.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,290
I'm with BSI British Standard Institution

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,730
and I'm very happy to present to you

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,423
Third Party Risk Mitigation
by Using ISO Standards.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,179
But what is ISO?

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,710
Who is ISO?

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,360
What are international standards?

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,350
These are all very valid questions.

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,460
And I hope that I will be able

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,169
to answer those questions

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,833
in the next couple of minutes.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,360
So, ISO is an international organization

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,770
and it stands for
International Organization

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,893
for Standardization.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,839
It's a worldwide federation

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,610
of national standards body

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,810
and the nongovernmental organization

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,400
representing or consisting
of 160 organizations

30
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,423
with a global footprint.

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,810
For example, American
National Standards Institution

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,567
also known as ANSI as an example

33
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,970
and we present in writing

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,730
in Singapore Standards Council SSC

35
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,103
or from India we have BIS,

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,660
Bureau of Indian standards.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,859
And I'm working under institution BSI

38
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,223
which is representing the
United Kingdom at ISO.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,489
The member organizations

40
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,450
are collaborating development

41
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,250
and promotion of international standards,

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,520
for technology science and set testing,

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,630
working condition, social issues at work.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,990
ISO and its members

45
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,430
then sell those documents as standards.

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,040
At General Assembly,

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,429
which consists of
representatives from ISO members

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,080
and elected leader
called Principal Officers

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,220
act as the decision making body for ISO.

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,728
The organization is headquarter's
in Geneva Switzerland.

51
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:55,640
We are controlling Secretary

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,142
to oversees the operation.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,090
So ISO is not an abbreviation

54
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,600
and it's very important to understand this

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,710
because ISO is actually a word.

56
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,810
And it's derivated from the Greek word

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,620
called isos, meaning equal

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,040
which is the root for the prefix

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,602
of a lot of words in the English language.

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,620
For example isometric,

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,890
which stands for the equal
measure of dimensions

62
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,549
or isonomy equal to the law

63
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,390
or people before the law.

64
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,459
Isobar the famous line we know all from TV

65
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,130
and to weather reports signify

66
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,079
where the same barometric
pressure is present

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,460
or as a genetic
characterizing the assembly

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,280
or the identical identical genes.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,490
So, for example identical
twins isogenetic.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,910
Now, you may say, why are we using ISO

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,600
and not IOS

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,489
like International Organization
for Standardization?

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,640
Well, as said earlier,

74
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,779
ISO is actually a word.

75
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,510
And it's globally meant to denote

76
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,870
and describe the organization.

77
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,000
And avoid severity of abbreviations,

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,553
which would be the result of translations

79
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:32,290
of that expression
International Organization

80
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,270
for Standardization to
different languages.

81
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,479
So for example, German
language we would say,

82
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,920
International organization for normal.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,390
Now, you can imagine how many
different languages they are

84
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,990
and how many different
abbreviations we would have.

85
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,710
So ISO makes a lot of sense

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,883
to have the same term on
an international level.

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,099
Here, we see a quick map of the countries

88
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,483
and territories represented at ISO.

89
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,263
As you can see,

90
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,900
the majority of countries and territories

91
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,573
have representation at Geneva.

92
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,272
And help to shape International Standards.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,570
The next area I would
like to talk about is

94
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,253
the concept of third parties.

95
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,060
And traditionally, we
think about third parties

96
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:35,543
like our customers, our suppliers.

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,540
Well, there's actually a
little bit more to that.

98
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,660
Because when we look at ourselves

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,380
as the green dot in the middle,

100
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,790
we recognize that we the organization

101
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,120
have actually a lot of connection points

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,270
to our customers as
mentioned to suppliers.

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,640
But also to investors to
contractors and subcontractors

104
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,960
to governmental and
regulatory authorities.

105
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,662
But also to interest groups.

106
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,799
And all those groups may have

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,400
sub relationships to their third parties.

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,299
So it's not unusual to see that customers

109
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,070
may have their own customer relationships

110
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,599
or that our suppliers are using suppliers

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,483
and to suppliers of the
suppliers are using suppliers.

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,623
So the question would be obviously,

113
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,859
how can we protect ourselves

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,560
in an increasingly complex

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,083
and interconnected
world, from cyber risks,

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,303
to the IT systems of those third parties.

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,159
The connections are not limited

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,380
to one level as I mentioned earlier,

119
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,020
so even if we protect ourselves

120
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,130
from our direct contacts,

121
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,450
it's quite feasible to understand

122
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,219
that a risk that materializes itself

123
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,300
to the third fourth level

124
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,670
can easily bubble up and risk us as well.

125
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,060
So the question would be,

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,180
how can we do that?

127
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,720
How can we protect
ourselves from those risks?

128
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
And I would like to talk about

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,140
a couple of ISO standards in this context.

130
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,590
The most important one is I believe,

131
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,690
ISO 31,000.

132
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,280
ISO 31,000 is a standard

133
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,760
that describes options

134
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,723
an organization can use to address risk.

135
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,870
But I also would like to emphasize

136
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,900
that in the ISO word

137
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,472
risk is not meant to be negative.

138
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,000
Risk is actually neutral.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,820
Risk can be positive can be negative.

140
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,849
Risk is just simply

141
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,533
the level of uncertainty
of a particular situation.

142
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,850
And it's very very important

143
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,060
that organizations do
proper risk assessments,

144
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,130
identifying potential risks

145
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,000
they are exposed to,
or might be exposed to.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,700
So that they can exploit those
risks if they are positive,

147
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,393
or avoid those risks if they are negative.

148
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,000
So ISO 31,000 last issued in 2018

149
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,070
provides a wonderful framework

150
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,620
to describe possible risk,

151
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,340
but I'd like to emphasize that
in is a guidance document.

152
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,683
And organizations cannot
be certified to ISO 31,000.

153
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,910
But it's a standard
that can be easily used

154
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,403
and utilized by organizations
of all types and sizes.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,440
And the risk management is
a very iterative process.

156
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,139
It's not something that
you do and forget about it.

157
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,840
It's something that you keep on doing

158
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,410
at a regular base

159
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,640
because the risk environment is changing.

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,090
New risks will pop up,

161
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,070
and all the existing risks
might vanish over time.

162
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,440
I'd be not getting as relevant

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,730
or not being relevant as you'd be.

164
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,500
So it's very important to understand

165
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,180
that the risk assessments,

166
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,323
need to be done on a regular base.

167
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,470
The next standard is ISO 27,001.

168
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,260
And it was last revised 2017.

169
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,803
And it's a standard about
Information Security.

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,410
Information security is the domain

171
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,410
that governs or addresses

172
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,709
how information can be

173
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,143
and should be protected
by an organization.

174
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,250
The fundamental idea of ISO 27,001

175
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,690
Is that it addresses risks concerning

176
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,690
the three areas of availability,
integrity, confidentiality.

177
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,883
On a regular basis this is
referred to the CIA angle.

178
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,089
It describes the information
security management system

179
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,993
also called ISMS.

180
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,040
The establishment and
implementation of an ISMS

181
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,400
is influenced by the organization's
needs and objectives,

182
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,040
its security requirements

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,610
and the organization's processes

184
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,483
used and the size and
structure of the organization.

185
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,120
In other words,

186
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,980
there's not one ISMS
for all organizations.

187
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,440
Each organization will need to have

188
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,300
their own specific ISMS

189
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,970
that is addressing its
specific requirements,

190
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,440
its specific situation

191
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,393
and its particular size and
organizational structure.

192
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,540
the ISMS will provide confidence

193
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,122
to interested parties that
the risk adequately managed.

194
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,940
The ISMS is supposed to be integrated

195
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,053
into the organization's
processes and overall structure.

196
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,370
So, it's very imperative to understand

197
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,230
that there is not the
organization's processes

198
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,890
and then there is the ISMS.

199
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,650
No, it's all coming together

200
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,380
into the ISMS for the organization

201
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,523
addressing the organization structure.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,430
It is expected that your
information security

203
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,250
management systems
implementation will be scaled

204
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,313
in accordance with the
needs of the organization.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,980
This translates into the
need to revise the ISMS

206
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,120
on a regular base and adapt

207
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,923
and adopt the situation
as it presents itself.

208
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,730
So, what are the benefits

209
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,823
of an ISO 27001 Management System?

210
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,940
The four areas that ISO 27,001

211
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,920
really helps an organization with

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,920
is reputation, engagement,
compliance and risk management.

213
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,880
So, how is ISO 27,001
helping an organization

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,150
with regard to reputation?

215
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, it helps the organization

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,800
to identify the risks to the information

217
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,150
under their jurisdiction.

218
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,180
It helps the organization
to place procedures

219
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,160
or enables prompt detection

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,730
of information security breaches

221
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,010
and it helps with the requirements

222
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,400
to continually improve

223
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,930
the information security
management system.

224
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,000
And that in itself helps

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to promote the reputation
of an organization.

226
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,810
With regard to engagement,

227
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,979
ISO 27,001 requires the organization

228
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,478
to identify internal and
external stakeholders

229
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:05,949
which are relevant to
the management system.

230
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,440
It requires the
organization to communicate

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,190
the ISMS policies and ensures

232
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,230
that the workforce understands,

233
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,860
how they contribute to it.

234
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,093
Thus leading to bigger
and greater engagement.

235
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,810
And last but not least,

236
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,640
top management needs to
define the ISMS rules

237
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,760
and ensures individuals are competent.

238
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,689
And with that management commitment

239
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,360
and with that top management engagement,

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,530
it really helps to drive

241
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,357
the ISMS throughout your organization.

242
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:45,780
ISO 27,001 also helps
with regard to compliance.

243
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,110
ISO 27,001 gives the
organization a framework

244
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,590
which helps you to manage

245
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,220
your legal and regulatory requirements.

246
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,440
It makes you to review and communicate

247
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,223
to your regulatory requirements
to other interested parties.

248
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,430
With regard to risk management,

249
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,459
ISO 27,001 makes you assess the risk

250
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,690
on to information security,

251
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,630
so you can identify potential weaknesses

252
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,830
and response to those.

253
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,910
It requires you to put in place

254
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,659
controls that are
proportionate to the risk.

255
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,912
And it requires you

256
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,110
to continually evaluate the risks

257
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,840
to your information security

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,053
and makes control super appropriate.

259
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,930
Now, the benefits the information

260
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,079
with regards to reputation

261
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,430
and risk identically improved reputation,

262
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,959
the stakeholders will be more confident

263
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,263
and it establishes trust building.

264
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,070
With regard to engagement,

265
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,070
an ISO 27,001 Management System
improves InfoSec awareness

266
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,270
and demonstrates management commitment.

267
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,810
Compliance it reduces
likelihood of legal issues.

268
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,449
And I would like to emphasize

269
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,610
it doesn't eliminate legal issues.

270
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,380
It reduces the likelihood

271
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,240
of legal issues

272
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,760
has a huge difference.

273
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,390
With regard to risk management

274
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,360
and ISO 27,001 Management System,

275
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,440
provides cost savings
to to minimize risks.

276
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,750
And last but not least,
and improves a CIA posture.

277
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,863
Remember confidentiality,
integrity and availability.

278
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,050
On this slide, I would like to quickly

279
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,593
talk about how 27001 works.

280
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,523
It was published in 2017.

281
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,670
It's in the third or fourth revision now,

282
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,819
based on a British Standard

283
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,410
that was published many many years ago,

284
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,520
and later on then adopted
as an ISO standard.

285
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,040
It's based on the high level structure,

286
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,420
which is a common framework

287
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,729
for all ISO Management System Standards.

288
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,880
At the Annex SL is
encouraging the incorporation

289
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,460
of various management systems

290
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,650
into one management system
for the organization.

291
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,500
So, for example,

292
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
if an organization has
Quality Management System

293
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,513
or an Environmental Management System.

294
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,410
These systems can be easily integrated

295
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,978
combined with InfoSec Management System.

296
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:35,979
Cause the fundamental clauses
of fundamental requirements

297
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,439
will... management
responsibility identification

298
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:45,983
of context it Shall audit
are corrective actions,

299
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,640
documentation requirements.

300
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,500
All these kind of things

301
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,750
are common for all management systems.

302
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,460
And once you have management system

303
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,270
following the ISO standards,

304
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,130
it's very very easy simple

305
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,960
as an additional management system

306
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,653
for other ISO standards.

307
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,819
ISO 27,001 address it explicitly

308
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,429
information security or we
can also say cyber risks

309
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,869
in supply chain relationships.

310
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,463
There's a very specific
clause in ISO 27,001

311
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:25,099
that addresses the need to know

312
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,022
and to properly manage your supply base.

313
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,133
Talking about supplier relationship.

314
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,800
Information Security Management System

315
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,159
is mitigating the risk associated

316
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,000
with suppliers accessing
the organization's asset

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,623
shall be agreed with the
supplier and documented.

318
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,233
So translation into plain English.

319
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,020
If there is a supplier
if there is a third party

320
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,020
that accesses your
information your assets.

321
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,820
This will need to be documented

322
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,102
and properly assessed for its risk.

323
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,260
It needs to agreements with your suppliers

324
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,820
including requirements to
address information security

325
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,760
with regards to communication
technologies services

326
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,713
and the product supply chain.

327
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,370
And I really would like to emphasize

328
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,479
that word supply chain.

329
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,780
So even if you have a
contract with a supplier

330
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,200
it really forces the supplier

331
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,600
to have similar agreements

332
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,193
and similar controls for their suppliers.

333
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,220
Subsequently the supplier
suppliers will have the same

334
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,043
control requirements for their suppliers.

335
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,493
Therefore it cascading down
the entire supply chain.

336
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,476
Organization shall regularly monitor

337
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:03,477
and review and audit
supplier service delivery.

338
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,930
This means that you need
to monitor the performance

339
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,883
of your suppliers with regards
to information security.

340
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,290
Many organizations have
already a very solid

341
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,716
and traverse system to monitor

342
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,930
the suppliers performance with regards

343
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,490
to quality of their products and services,

344
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,320
with regard to on time
delivery and so forth.

345
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,820
But ISO 27,001 emphasizes

346
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,810
that you need to audit an organizations

347
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,570
or should I say your
suppliers performance,

348
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,862
with regards to information security.

349
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,130
Moving on to the next standard.

350
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,830
It's ISO 22301.

351
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,342
ISO 22301,

352
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,620
last revised last year.

353
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,453
It's now in the second edition.

354
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,220
Also originally based
on a British Standard,

355
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,520
of many many years ago

356
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,860
and it's addressing

357
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,750
very generically speaking,

358
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,060
the need of organizations
to continually operate

359
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,003
even in the presence or even
after so called disruptions.

360
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,170
And ISO 22301 is not addressing
any specific disruptions.

361
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,080
But we can easily see that disruptions

362
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,006
can be natural occurrences
like earthquakes,

363
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,343
tsunamis, name it.

364
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,413
But it also could be man-made.

365
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,643
The result of terrorist
attacks, the result of war.

366
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:04,659
Recently we have heard about disruptions

367
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,860
because of some kind of pandemic.

368
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,060
Covid-19 is a wonderful
example of a disruption

369
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,610
organizations needs to consider

370
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,382
when implementing their
22301 management system.

371
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,787
The standard specifies the structure

372
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,590
and the requirements

373
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,610
of Business Continuity Management System,

374
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,479
also called BCMS

375
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,160
requires organization to implement.

376
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,450
The outcome maintaining a BCMS,

377
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,850
is yet with the organization's

378
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,409
legal regulatory organizational

379
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,850
and industry requirements.

380
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,629
Its products and services
provided processes employed,

381
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,900
the size and structure of the organization

382
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,543
and the requirements of
its interested parties.

383
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,980
Does this relate verbatim
out of the standard?

384
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,130
It really emphasizes,

385
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,600
it's about evaluating

386
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,550
what the organization ought to

387
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,680
in order to deliver their desired outcome.

388
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,230
So if you are a manufacturer
of some kind of a gadget

389
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,540
that's what you're doing
manufacturing a gadget

390
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,270
and delivering it to the users.

391
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,760
In order to do that,

392
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,810
you need to have a system that helps you

393
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,200
to evaluate possible disruptions

394
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,200
and the possible results
of those disruptions,

395
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,980
impact of those disruptions.

396
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,900
So that you can implement
appropriate countermeasures,

397
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,373
appropriate controls.

398
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,240
So, the two important concepts in 22301

399
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,020
are circling around the
Business Impact Analysis

400
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,120
also called BIA

401
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,139
as well as the risk assessment.

402
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,820
And depending upon which school of thought

403
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,780
you're coming from,

404
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,566
there might be people say,

405
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:08,143
BIA is for us and then
the risk assessment.

406
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,209
And then they obviously say no,

407
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,800
the risk assessment is first
and then you do the BIA.

408
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,163
The truth is actually
somewhere in between.

409
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,520
It really doesn't matter
which one you do first.

410
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,020
But the important thing
is that an organization

411
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,770
is doing BIA and risk
assessments on a continual base.

412
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,510
And it's an iterative approach.

413
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,860
It's not something you once do

414
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,429
and forget about it.

415
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,860
No, it's really something

416
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,540
that needs to be done on a regular base.

417
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,210
And organizations really
needs to implement

418
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,910
and maintain the risk assessment process

419
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,610
to properly identify
the risks of disruptions

420
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,409
to the organization, in order to analyze

421
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,593
and evaluate the identify risks

422
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:57,360
and determine which
risks require treatment.

423
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,419
Of the Business Impact Analysis,

424
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,700
organizations need to
evaluate and determine

425
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,920
the dependencies they have,

426
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,440
including the partners and suppliers

427
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,363
and interdependencies of
prioritized activities.

428
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,970
Many people see the ISO 22301

429
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,189
like an umbrella that is protecting

430
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,750
an organization to a certain degree

431
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,703
from the weather from the environment.

432
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,680
Like an umbrella protects
you from rain or sunshine,

433
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
an ISO 22301 management
system in certain way,

434
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,879
so green protects an organization

435
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,530
from a issues not necessarily
easily predictable

436
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,350
from those disruptions that may occur

437
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,669
or should I say risk that will occur.

438
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,723
Because it's only a
question of probability,

439
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,080
things will go wrong things will happen.

440
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,889
The only question is how can we prevent

441
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,580
the serious impact to our organization

442
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,770
and to our customers.

443
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,290
And ISO 22301 provides a framework

444
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,600
to help organizations

445
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,673
to be prepared for the unexpected.

446
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,639
It's very very important that

447
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
while you're doing the risk assessment

448
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,613
or the Business Impact Analysis,

449
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,680
don't leave anything off the table.

450
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,240
Everything needs to be considered.

451
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,300
How ridiculously it might sound,

452
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,690
but it is very important
to really consider

453
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,593
that things can go
wrong and will go wrong.

454
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,510
Here I would like to address

455
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,963
the concept of Organizational Resilience.

456
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,306
Organizational resilience
is the ability and capacity

457
00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:06,197
of an organization to
withstand potentially

458
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,770
significant economic, and systematic risks

459
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,770
or systematic discontinuations
or business interruptions

460
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,110
by adapting or recovering
or resisting being affected

461
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,180
and resuming its core
operation to continue

462
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,133
to provide an acceptable level
of functioning and structure.

463
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,929
Let's start with the last
portion of this paragraph.

464
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,170
It's really talking
about an acceptable level

465
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,720
of functioning and structure.

466
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,720
It does not say a perfect
level of functioning.

467
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,350
Everybody understands that
in case of a disruption,

468
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,560
there will be the degradation,

469
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,419
there will be less performance

470
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,730
and that's okay to a certain degree.

471
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,060
Organizational Resilience is the concept

472
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,909
that helps organization
to be able to adapt

473
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,943
and align its strategies.

474
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,879
Its management systems

475
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,380
and its governance structure

476
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,380
as well its supply chain quickly
to changing environments.

477
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,689
Coming back to the theme of 2020.

478
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,580
Pandemics.

479
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,403
How many supply chains were interrupted?

480
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,470
Or should I rephrase the question?

481
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,723
How many supply chains were not affected?

482
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,740
So obviously, that is something

483
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,760
that every organization needs to consider.

484
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,230
So moving forward towards
Organizational resilience

485
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,193
and increasing resilience.

486
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:54,700
There's a very important thing to consider

487
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,840
with regard to your suppliers,

488
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,523
information security and
information resilience.

489
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,879
In conclusion, I would
like to share with you

490
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,120
that there are these four standards

491
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,120
31,000 27,001 22301 22316,

492
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,610
which is another standard,

493
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,870
which I did not address,

494
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,912
but it's definitely something to review.

495
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,440
The two standards,

496
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,530
the first and the fourth
one are guidelines

497
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,930
and the other two in the middle

498
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,310
are certification standards

499
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,310
to which organizations can be certified.

500
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,760
So what are the next steps?

501
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,593
I think

502
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,353
No third parties your organization has.

503
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,750
You should review the content

504
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,540
of 31000, 27001, 22301

505
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,213
as well as 22316.

506
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,509
And then in the first few months

507
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,310
after following this presentation,

508
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,230
understand what these third parties do

509
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,050
with you unto you.

510
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,850
You should identify the risks
associated with third parties

511
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,860
and then within six months

512
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,560
you define and implement process,

513
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,169
which allows for a proactive
review of all third party

514
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,543
bound to succeeding if possible.

515
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,620
Thank you very much for your time.

516
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,639
Thank you very much

517
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,770
for attending this everybody

518
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,352
and thank you
