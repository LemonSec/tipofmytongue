8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,760
I'd now like to turn
it over to Craig Jones

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,973
for the presentation.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,959
- Hello, my name's Craig Jones,

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,092
I'm the director of
cybercrime at Interpol.

12
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:33,310
A little bit about Interpol
and myself, first of all,

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,758
just to set a bit of scene here.

14
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:38,320
Interpol is a global,

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,720
mutual international
nongovernmental organization.

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,449
We have 194 member countries

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,790
and our ambition is to connect
leasing for a safer world.

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,070
As part of ambition, we
have a mission of preventing

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,730
and fighting crime, through
enhanced cooperation

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,580
and innovation on police
and security matters.

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,150
But what does that actually mean?

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,440
What is Interpol?

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,720
How do we work?

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,030
How do we support our 194 member countries

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,300
and more importantly,

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,473
how do we look to reduce the
global impact of cybercrime?

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,670
I'm a seconded officer

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,300
from a national crime
agency in United Kingdom.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,697
That's where I'm paid from normally

30
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,340
and that's where I normally work.

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,770
However, I've been seconded
into Interpol as many of the,

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,130
over a thousand plus people
working in the organization

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,570
from different law enforcement
agencies around the world.

34
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,800
My role previously in United Kingdom

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,330
was leading on the prepare
side of capability building

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,179
within the UK for law enforcement.

37
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,020
That entailed managing a budget

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,060
of about 45 million pounds a year

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,610
to help build out law
enforcement capabilities

40
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,580
on a local, regional, national
and international manner

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,880
against the national cybersecurity
program, United Kingdom

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,422
in order to combat cybercrime.

43
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:51,300
But as we all know, crime itself

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,009
and cybercrime especially is global.

45
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,950
So effectively Interpol,
that's their role,

46
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,860
is how do they help coordinate

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,210
the fight against cybercrime
for the member countries

48
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,312
across the world.

49
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,240
What's the concept we
look at, how do we work?

50
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,500
How does actually policing
look to prevent cybercrime?

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,650
Because that effectively comes back

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,840
to what is the policing purpose?

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,877
The policing purpose is
to protect communities,

54
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,463
that's their first purpose

55
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,010
and that's to save life and property,

56
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,709
but also we have to prevent crime

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,573
and we do this in a
number of different ways,

58
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,230
in a physical sense.

59
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,130
That's what policing is very good at.

60
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,250
We understand how to work
within our communities

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,810
on that physical sense.

62
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,230
Patrolling communities,
taking care of them,

63
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,280
speaking and engaging with them.

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,850
But how does that move across
now to that online world?

65
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,590
What does that policing context look like?

66
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,900
Well, we meant crime has moved massively

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,910
in the last 10, 20 years.

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,590
It's moved online.

69
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,730
In some cases now over
50% of crime is online.

70
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,380
We look at the average
cost of a data breach

71
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,670
or an attack on an organization.

72
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,119
It should prove to in some
cases to be $13 million a time.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,330
We do also look at, how is this allowed?

74
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,680
How does this happen?

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,680
We have over about 6 billion
internet users at the moment.

76
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,549
So effectively always people are online

77
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,030
and there were benefits of
being able to work online

78
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,250
and use it for our normal purposes.

79
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,470
We will benefit greatly from that.

80
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,650
But again, the cyber
criminals will then use that.

81
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,550
When we talk about cybercrime,

82
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,450
we're talking about a
non-commodity based crime type.

83
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,519
So when policing looks at
dealing with drugs, firearms,

84
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,780
modern human slavery, that's
a commodity based crime.

85
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,660
Policing has good techniques

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,500
to deal with that sort of crime.

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,940
We understand the commodity.

88
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,750
We understand how to break
that cycle of a crime.

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,356
But effectively in your mind well,

90
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,880
we're looking at criminals
using infrastructure

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,690
we use on a day to day basis.

92
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,820
So how do we remove that playing field?

93
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,070
How do we take what they use
out of our infrastructure

94
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,683
and prevent them from
being able to commit crime?

95
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,810
Who does that?

96
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,970
How do we do that?

97
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,500
Is it just a policing responsibility?

98
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,580
That's what we need to look at.

99
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,440
So at Interpol we have
three global crime programs.

100
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,740
We have an urbanized
emergent crime program,

101
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,040
we have a counter terrorism program

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,830
and we have the cybercrime program,

103
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,000
which is the program
that I'm responsible for,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,670
based here in Singapore,

105
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,620
but leading that fight around the world

106
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,633
with our member countries.

107
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,660
So what did we see just recently?

108
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,330
Well, we saw a massive uptake
in people working from home.

109
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,530
It was around the world.

110
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,270
We all suddenly have to upstate

111
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,030
and start working from home.

112
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,936
I'd be working at home now
since March, I'm still here now.

113
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,730
And we all of a sudden have
to set up that infrastructure

114
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,670
in a home based environment.

115
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,000
And that had to be done quickly.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,830
A number of companies
struggle to get that sort of

117
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,130
infrastructure in place

118
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,780
and also the security around it as well

119
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,789
in order to protect
the workforces at home.

120
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,590
That was also coupled with this massive

121
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,060
first of knowledge at
the time around COVID-19.

122
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,800
And what did the cyber criminals do?

123
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
They exploited it.

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,740
They looked at the panic

125
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,800
and the fear that was going on,

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,910
and they look to repurpose the cyber tools

127
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,620
that they would use to commit crime

128
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,110
and repurpose it into
that COVID environment.

129
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,260
There was a huge first information,

130
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,560
as I said, from all of us.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,430
So we were all online
looking at COVID situations.

132
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,380
What's going on?

133
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,520
What's the latest data?

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,013
What's the latest information?

135
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:37,580
And the criminals looked
into that as well.

136
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,960
And effectively then they repurpose

137
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,130
a lot of the tools they've previously used

138
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,409
and use those then to
change the methodology

139
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,264
that they're working in.

140
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,200
We also had to look at,

141
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,760
the key supply chain
in all of this as well.

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,920
How was it the health care product?

143
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,450
And you saw it, different tech there,

144
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,430
the different scams online
about, face masks available

145
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,300
and people going online
trying to buy face masks

146
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,666
and et cetera, putting orders

147
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,090
and paying money over

148
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,289
and for those orders not to not to arrive.

149
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,180
Those sort of scams were
the criminal sector.

150
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,030
But also more importantly,
we have to look at the frets

151
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,039
and the surfacing, the new vulnerabilities

152
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,160
targeting people working from home.

153
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:20,130
(mouse clicks)

154
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,940
So, what are roles and responsibility

155
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,963
for creating that safer world?

156
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:28,870
Who does it, what role
do we all have in there,

157
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,260
that ecosystem of cybersecurity?

158
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,510
How do we protect that critical
national infrastructure?

159
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,830
How do we protect the
different industries?

160
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,000
How do we protect the
small medium enterprises,

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the communities, the individuals online?

162
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,703
We have to look at this

163
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,070
and we have to discuss this.

164
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,890
We all have to understand
our different roles

165
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,250
that we have to play,

166
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,630
but more importantly,
within that ecosystem,

167
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,240
we all have a very, very important role,

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,450
but it's much like the
internet, it's interconnected.

169
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,409
And without one piece fulfilling its role,

170
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,890
the others are not able to as well.

171
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,599
So from policing, it's a
different world for us now.

172
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,960
We very much, as I said earlier,

173
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,409
used to working in
their physical settings.

174
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,890
Working in the community,

175
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,110
talking to people in the communities,

176
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,553
patrolling in the communities

177
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:15,130
and that's what police does.

178
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,330
It works within the communities.

179
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,650
In that own mind sense,

180
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,010
the presence of policing
in the online world,

181
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,320
whilst it's there,

182
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,510
it's not like us walking
down the street every day

183
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,469
or us having those interactions.

184
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,120
So we're having to look at
different ways that we can work.

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Different ways that we
can go into the community,

186
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,570
we can understand what's happening.

187
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,480
But again, looking at expertise as well.

188
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,070
Most of us joined policing
as I did many years ago.

189
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,180
My first day on the beat
was spent putting a hat on,

190
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,170
walking down the street

191
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,280
and spending many hours talking to people,

192
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,729
finding out what was going
on in that local community.

193
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,320
We've now moved into this online space

194
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,150
and this is what we're looking at now.

195
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,270
How do we work in that online space

196
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,719
and how do we work
effectively with our partners?

197
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,580
So what's that global ecosystem like?

198
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,919
Many of you here today
are from private sector.

199
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,680
You're either working in cybersecurity,

200
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,993
you're working in companies
that provide those systems,

201
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:15,400
that provide those tools
that allow us to get online,

202
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,440
to live online effectively,
to use the tools throughout,

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,573
and then we'll look and play online.

204
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,130
We also look with
different partners as well.

205
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,250
So we look at different
international organizations.

206
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,169
What are the different
international organizations roles?

207
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,130
We work closely with the
United Nations as well,

208
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,780
looking at the issues around cybersecurity

209
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,600
and cybercrime as well.

210
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,110
But we in policing are focused

211
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,460
on the cybercrime aspect of this.

212
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,760
What do those cyber criminals look like?

213
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
How do we develop those
important partnerships

214
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,609
with different organizations,

215
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,230
both internationally,
regionally and locally.

216
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,560
We've known government
organizations as well

217
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,130
and civil society.

218
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,290
We look at people around the world,

219
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,270
how can we interact with them?

220
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,610
How can we look at how we
can prevent cybercrime?

221
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,840
How do they do that?

222
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,930
How can we learn from them?

223
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,319
But one of our main
partners in all of this

224
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,040
is private industry,

225
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,930
and we've looked to develop
a public-private partnership

226
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,709
for three to four years now,

227
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,300
and that's developing key partnerships

228
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,209
with those industry sectors.

229
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,400
They're even looking at
the cybercrime threats,

230
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,170
they're looking on a
sector specific basis,

231
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,469
or they're looking across
the whole ecosystem.

232
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,540
We have a special project
called Project Gateway,

233
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,150
and that allows us to
receive data information

234
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,870
from these private partners.

235
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,880
We have to look at as well

236
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,750
about our rules of processing data.

237
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,470
Many of you heard about GDPR in Europe.

238
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,360
There's a specific way
now that we are governed

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,680
in different international
context, in national context

240
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,589
and regional context, about
numerous ways you'll receive

241
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,810
and process and handle data.

242
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,369
Interpol's no different.

243
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,830
We have our own rules of processing data,

244
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,000
which is specially monitored

245
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,530
by independent part of the organization.

246
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,910
They look to see what
data sets we bring in,

247
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,260
how long do we retain those data sets for,

248
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,248
how relevant are they as well

249
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,960
and what are we using them for?

250
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Because effectively what
we aren't using them for

251
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,730
is to fight crime with
our member countries.

252
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,360
So we have 13 public private partners

253
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,210
that work very closely with us.

254
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,210
We have some working directly with us

255
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,570
in our cyber fusion
center here in Singapore,

256
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,860
which I'll go into a
few more details later,

257
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,970
but how do we actually share that data?

258
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,830
What do we do with that data?

259
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,730
How do we add value to it as
well in the policing context?

260
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,930
Another important partner
is the National CERTS.

261
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,510
And those are the government bodies

262
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,000
that look after mainly critical
national infrastructure.

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,830
We share information with them,

264
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,860
we speak to them on a regular basis.

265
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,030
We use such organizations as FIRST,

266
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,140
which many of you might be aware of,

267
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,270
which is Forum for Incident
Responders and Security Teams

268
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,607
to look at best practice together.

269
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,550
And we look to work more closely with them

270
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,520
in the coming months and years as well.

271
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,420
We also, during COVID-19,

272
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,719
had to look at different ways of working.

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,700
As I said, what are those
communities that we serve?

274
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,440
How do we serve them?

275
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,550
We looked at such uses on
the Slack groups as well.

276
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,949
A number of different
Slack groups came together

277
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,470
during the COVID-19 situation

278
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,810
and they just brought together
lots of different people

279
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,589
from the cybersecurity will,
all wanting to do roles

280
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,372
that we're looking to
protect the community,

281
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,110
that we're looking to take
down some of the infrastructure

282
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,207
that the cyber criminals repurpose.

283
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:41,460
But the main driving factor
for all of this is trust.

284
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,430
We have to trust each
other within this area.

285
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,969
The cyber criminals can form their

286
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,860
groups together quite quickly.

287
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,100
They trust each other sometimes,
sometimes they don't,.

288
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,993
But certainly in the policing

289
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,880
and the private sector,
we have to build that bond

290
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,520
with our communities, that bonded trust,

291
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,449
we trust, they trust us

292
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,830
and then that allows us

293
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,460
to flow that data information between us.

294
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,250
We have to look on this as
a global approach as well.

295
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,030
We can't just look on this in
small local areas or regional,

296
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,490
we have to do this on a global basis.

297
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,170
But also we have to be very conscious

298
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,283
of the different priorities that we have.

299
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
So, looking at the priorities then

300
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,230
and that was very important to us

301
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,130
during our response to the
global pandemic of COVID-19,

302
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,000
we looked at the cyber threats.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,502
So how did we work first of all?

304
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,890
Well, first of all, we had
to understand the threat.

305
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,199
What was going on?

306
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,370
What was the threat?

307
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,410
What was the risk?

308
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,780
What was the harm?

309
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,600
And then we have to put
mitigation in against those risks.

310
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,980
We had to look to see how
we could reduce the harm

311
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,940
that was being pulled to the communities

312
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,980
by cyber criminals
during the COVID 19 side.

313
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,147
We have to look at how
we collected that data

314
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:54,330
and information with our private partners.

315
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,720
We then had to store that, process it,

316
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,450
evaluate it, analyze it,

317
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,760
and then disseminate that
out to our member countries.

318
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,330
'Cause there's no point
in having all these data

319
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,270
and not doing something with it.

320
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,040
We then had to look at
the different activities

321
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,610
we could undertake with
our member countries

322
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,730
and how could we support
them in either operations

323
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,360
or awareness campaign, in order
to protect their communities

324
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,690
within the countries.

325
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,530
And we did this at a
number of different ways,

326
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,810
and I'll talk about our
global awareness campaign

327
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,530
of Wash Your Cyber Hands in awhile.

328
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,569
We also look to our capability.

329
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,260
So what are the capabilities
that we currently have,

330
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,790
but also what are the capabilities

331
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,140
that we're building here
at Interpol at this moment?

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,250
How could we advance those,
bring those online quicker

333
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,320
in order to get those capabilities out

334
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,190
in order to support member countries?

335
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,820
So what are the different
areas that we looked at?

336
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,220
Well, we looked at the malicious domains.

337
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,530
We saw the massive increase in there,

338
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,480
where domains have been created

339
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,643
with the word COVID or corona.

340
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:56,510
And obviously a lot of
these were perfectly normal.

341
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,360
But what the cyber criminals were doing,

342
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,070
they were spotting an opportunity.

343
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,630
So creating those were malicious attempt.

344
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,200
And we looked at approximately 40,000

345
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
high risk newly registered domains.

346
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,620
But we did that with
different areas as well.

347
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,510
We looked at the Slack
group that sets out,

348
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,433
we work close with these
new groups that form,

349
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,810
this online platforms, these groups,

350
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,400
which form almost overnight effectively,

351
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,810
but they're morphed into this community.

352
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,270
But we're looking at ways
that they could protect

353
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,877
everybody that was online.

354
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,180
It was different companies,
different organizations,

355
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,186
different individuals coming together

356
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:33,030
and we joined this Slack
group we took part in them

357
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,203
and we're really grateful
they're stood up and running now

358
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:37,540
and we're still talk about community.

359
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,540
We also looked at the malware
that was being put together

360
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,370
and that ransomware
attacks that were going on.

361
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,800
Some of these would target
specifically at hospitals.

362
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,839
And we were very close
about our private partners

363
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,050
in order to mitigate some of those attacks

364
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,140
on specific hospital where
their systems were locked down,

365
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,530
they couldn't access
that data information.

366
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,069
They weren't able to
put in that information

367
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,245
that they need in order
to treat their patients.

368
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,740
We also looked through the
online scams and phishing,

369
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,550
because again, we said
there was that first

370
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,680
and people were going online.

371
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,849
Do we always know what links
we click on when we're online?

372
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,063
I've got two young sons, they'll
just click the information.

373
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,030
They just go on to different sites,

374
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,490
they click on different
sites as many of us do.

375
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,820
How protected are they
when they're on there?

376
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,400
As we know, the criminal repurpose this.

377
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,360
They look for the vulnerabilities there.

378
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,310
They look in order to download,

379
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,699
but it's just coded steel,

380
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,680
used to prevent you from passwords,

381
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,630
and then use those back to commit crime

382
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,886
or sell those details on.

383
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:45,089
They also created the full
website due to COVID-19

384
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,800
to lure victims into
providing personal details

385
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,370
with sensitive information.

386
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,860
And then of course, we
looked at the key fret

387
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,560
related to remote workforce as where

388
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,969
a huge amount were suddenly online,

389
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,130
sorry, went online over the night.

390
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,163
There was a massive outbreak
on the use of infrastructure,

391
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,933
VPNs for example.

392
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,709
Companies had to pull together
really packages very quickly

393
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,702
to allow people to work
remotely from home.

394
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,980
We looked at potential
vulnerabilities on VPNs.

395
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,060
We also looked at teleconferencing
tools, which are on now,

396
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,119
what are the vulnerabilities
in those as well?

397
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,690
So some of the things that
we did then during that time

398
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,340
was our global malicious domain taskforce.

399
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,000
And we focused on the identification

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,430
and take down of malicious
domains related to COVID-19.

401
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,000
The taskforce identified

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,300
and analyzed about
200,000 malicious domains.

403
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,329
And we're still working through those

404
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:40,410
with private partners,
with our member countries,

405
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,762
looking to take those down.

406
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:43,820
I also said about Interpol,

407
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,440
we connected uniquely to
the 194 member countries.

408
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,600
And probably some of you heard
of the Interpol Red Notices,

409
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,710
those arrest notices that we hear about.

410
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,530
But we also have Purple Notices

411
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,120
where we put the emo details out

412
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
about different crime types.

413
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,359
And we looked at three different ones

414
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,930
during this current period.

415
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,810
We looked to the ransomware attacks

416
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,129
on critical infrastructure, hospitals,

417
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,390
and released information to
member countries on that.

418
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,069
We looked at a Trojan
malware called coronavirus,

419
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,955
and again, we pushed information out

420
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,990
through all 194 member countries.

421
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,450
And we looked to the banking Trojan

422
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,107
using COVID-19 information as a lure.

423
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,619
Another part there was on
cyber activity reports,

424
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,849
and they're more specifically
designed to go out

425
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,840
into specific member countries

426
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,169
or region, where we
notice, some certain acts.

427
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,730
We published their 15 votes in total

428
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,310
and they were identifying
specific cyber threat,

429
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,230
particularly around where

430
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,670
malicious infrastructure was identified

431
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,180
or potential threat actors
were facilitating ransomware.

432
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,470
We pass those details out
to the member countries

433
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,330
and then support them in
their activities around that.

434
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,600
As I said, we looked at
the ransomware attack.

435
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,570
That's a full team organizations

436
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,200
and providing technical support

437
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,160
and guidance for them
to the organizations,

438
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,037
with our private partners,

439
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:05,533
and again looking that
observation aspect as well.

440
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:06,590
And then as I mentioned lastly,

441
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,709
our global awareness campaign
of Wash Your Cyber Hands.

442
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,890
We ran over a four week that
had 42 member countries,

443
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,810
23 public versus private partners,

444
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,870
and we run that campaign
looking at the cyber threats.

445
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,341
We looked at a number of
different areas in there.

446
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:24,270
We looked at the sort
of the general threat,

447
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,280
we looked at the working from home,

448
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,910
we looked at the ransomware

449
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,070
and then we looked more
importantly at the end of the year

450
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,389
what people can do to protect themselves.

451
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,997
It reached more than 7.5
million users on May online,

452
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,170
as under the hashtag
of #WashYourCyberHands.

453
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,280
It was mentioned on
Twitter about 10,000 times

454
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,760
and it also generated 65 media
articles in 21 languages.

455
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,960
So again, this was about
looking at how we could prevent,

456
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,163
the cybercrime from
occurring in the first place.

457
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,460
(mouse clicks)

458
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,290
So as I mentioned, this is what
a Purple Notice looks like.

459
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,470
This is what we supposed for
all of our member countries.

460
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,770
It goes out, you pull the data

461
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,050
and information in from
the private partners.

462
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,832
We work with them closely to
put out this Purple Notices.

463
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,780
It goes around a specific threat type.

464
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,510
As I said, this one was
the ransomware attacks

465
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,860
potentially on healthcare institutions.

466
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,580
And we're raising that
awareness within the country.

467
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,139
So, the policing could then
go out into those communities

468
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,820
to look for how to protect them.

469
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,996
As I said, we also did
our Wash Your Cyber Hands

470
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:37,407
and we saw an impressive
take up during that period.

471
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,530
Again, this is how we release now,

472
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,180
this is how we go out into the community.

473
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,010
This is how we share information

474
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,460
around preventing cyber attacks.

475
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,290
We did it on the full feeds effectively.

476
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,310
We have it translated into
many different languages.

477
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,340
Again, coming from a UK organization

478
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,620
and maybe working in Europe
for most of my career,

479
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,889
it's been a fantastic
opportunity for me to come out

480
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,920
and see and work, with
many different cultures,

481
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,810
looking at the way Interpol
is able to reach out

482
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,500
around the world into
those 194 member countries.

483
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,180
But again, we all look

484
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,950
that we all working towards the same goal

485
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,183
to make the world a
safer place effectively.

486
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,479
So how do we do that then?

487
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,610
We've gonna have Global
Cybercrime Program.

488
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,030
As I said, we have three prime
programs here at Interpol.

489
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,820
Well, the way we're looking to do that

490
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,240
is on a local to regional and global,

491
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,177
and then back from a global
to regional to local basis.

492
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:39,637
We have a three key
pillars to our program.

493
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,600
And as I lead you to it earlier on,

494
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,189
we first of all, have to, you
know, what do we need to do?

495
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,260
We need to understand that threat picture,

496
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,910
so that's the first
area we need to work on.

497
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,197
We also then need to collect data

498
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:54,000
and information and that's
continual process forward.

499
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,720
We store it, we evaluate
it, we analyze it,

500
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,050
we process it again, we add value to it

501
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,010
and then we disseminate out
to our member countries.

502
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,300
And for many policing colleagues

503
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,950
that is our normal intelligence on it.

504
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,250
And again that's a business methodology

505
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,920
for a number of users.

506
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,520
We then talked about this
operation side that we work on.

507
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,150
So how do we support our member countries

508
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,460
in their investigations, in
their operational activity?

509
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,750
How do we school back?

510
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,130
We we're not executive body,

511
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,840
so, we don't have arrest powers now,

512
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,810
we have to work with our member countries

513
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,080
and provide the data information for them,

514
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,169
in order for them to take
action on effectively.

515
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,210
And as I said, the last one
is that capability building.

516
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,260
So what does that model look like?

517
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,340
Well, I have a little diagram here now.

518
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,090
We have it under the three main pillars.

519
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,128
We have the cybercrime threat response

520
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:48,650
and that area deals with
the data information.

521
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,480
Bringing that in, analyzing that,

522
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,450
using that data information effectively.

523
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,474
We then have our cybercrime
operations response,

524
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:57,822
that's cybercrime operation.

525
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:59,169
And what they do is work closely

526
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,835
with cybercrime threat response

527
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:02,257
to identify those opportunities

528
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:05,240
and there's operations,
which we can then work with

529
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,330
within the region

530
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,100
and member countries.

531
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,810
A good example of this
is in the Asian region,

532
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,360
where we have a special project

533
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,800
at cybercrime operations desk

534
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,840
and that's 10 member countries

535
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,939
where we work closely with
them, coordinating activities

536
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,630
and acting around taking positive

537
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,430
and proactive action within that region.

538
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,810
And that can either be
identifying a vulnerability,

539
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,550
and we're looking to
reduce that vulnerability.

540
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,360
One breach that we have was
there was a vulnerability

541
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,179
in some commercial regions.

542
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,890
We work closely with law enforcement

543
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,620
and assert as well there.

544
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,179
So we could then reduce the
effect of that vulnerability

545
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,460
within the region.

546
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,100
We identified over 20,000
routers just in that region

547
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,010
and we worked to each country

548
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,240
to reduce the vulnerability
in those routers as well.

549
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,526
So that was law enforcement

550
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:57,333
and assert working closely together.

551
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,057
We also have also then our
cyber capabilities program.

552
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:03,800
And the capabilities
we've covered in building

553
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,690
is the knowledge

554
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,170
and skills base within countries.

555
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,780
We also work closely with
our capacity building team

556
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,097
here at Interpol.

557
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,724
And what we will look to do

558
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,909
is to boost the cooperation
between countries

559
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,257
and regional (poor
audio drowns out sound).

560
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,669
We have our agent cybercrime
capacity development project.

561
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,280
We also have our glassy
class project as well,

562
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,070
which is similar to capacity building.

563
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,033
And then also we have our projects,

564
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,300
cyber capabilities building program

565
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,450
under our cyber foundation project.

566
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,230
And that's looking at the different tools

567
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,480
and techniques that we need
for us to connect leasing.

568
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,647
So we've just launched a
secure property platform

569
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:50,800
for 194 member countries
to share best knowledge

570
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,169
and best practice about cybercrime.

571
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,240
We're just about to launch our
secure operational platform

572
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,490
and that will allow us to
share operational information

573
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,020
and data between member countries

574
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,720
and ourselves as well.

575
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,097
And then also we're building out

576
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:06,440
our secure property platform,

577
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,238
sorry, our secure anical platform

578
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,460
and that's going to be to
bring in local data set

579
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,590
from national policing around
victims around operations,

580
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,389
and then combining that
with private sector data

581
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,220
here in one pool,

582
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,750
and that will then give us that

583
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,390
massive global overview
of what that means,

584
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,970
and then we can plan our
activities around that

585
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,883
to support our member countries.

586
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,899
So effectively what this is
looking at doing for all of us

587
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,710
is reducing the global
impact of cybercrime

588
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,890
and protect communities for a safer world.

589
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,450
That's the mandate that
the program ought to bring.

590
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,810
Again, it's looking at
reducing, how do we reduce that?

591
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,060
It's looking around global impact.

592
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,090
So this area, how can we remove the tools

593
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,459
that cyber criminals have access to?

594
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,320
How can we protect ourselves,

595
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,570
and our communities more effectively?

596
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,899
And again, coming into
communities for a safer world,

597
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,940
in much as in the physical sense,

598
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,450
we also want to do that
in an online sense.

599
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,330
But as I've said, we have to
do that with private sector,

600
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,556
and the cyber security industry

601
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:11,790
and our ecosystem.

602
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,180
So just to finish with that is,

603
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,730
how do we look to apply that?

604
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,610
Well, taking prevention as a thing.

605
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,469
And I'm trying to sort of merge together

606
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,260
the crime prevention side of this,

607
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,960
but also looking at cybersecurity.

608
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,967
We need to better understand the threat

609
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:31,076
and the attack vectors
to our organizations.

610
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,374
So again, that comes back to understand

611
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:33,980
that threat that we're saying.

612
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,250
We need to continuously
monitor all our systems

613
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,200
and network and applications,

614
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,510
and we need to look
unusual activity as well,

615
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,730
as also we have the inside
effect potentially as well.

616
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,480
So those are some of the
short thing terms we do.

617
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,870
And then mid term, well,
how do we prioritize?

618
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,409
You know, it's very important to

619
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,950
what's that vital information
that we need to protect

620
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,360
because we still need
to be able to use it.

621
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,409
I'm sure during COVID-19, a lot of us had

622
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,860
these business continuity plans

623
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,659
which were suddenly
brought out, looked out,

624
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,450
oh, that means that we're gonna this now.

625
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,840
So much in the sort of
cybersecurity space.

626
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,860
We don't wanna be busting off those plans

627
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,350
when we might have a data breach

628
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,969
and we suddenly think, Oh,
what do we really need to do?

629
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,030
What's the data set.

630
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,580
Do we know what data sets we have?

631
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,470
Who are key actors within
the business ecosystem?

632
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,816
Who do we collaborate with, at that time?

633
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,020
And then looking at a longer term future,

634
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,720
how do we set those
clear security policies

635
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,430
and rules for organizations
for remote workforce?

636
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,180
Well, I think that maybe might
not be so much long term,

637
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,780
I think all of us certainly have,

638
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,020
again, look at the different policies

639
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,670
and procedures, get those on,

640
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,780
make sure their fit for purpose.

641
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,090
And we learned, we all
learned as we go along.

642
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,350
But how do we enhance these
public-private partnerships

643
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,899
to boost our cyber capabilities

644
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,654
and also our prevention.

645
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,790
And again, coming back from our

646
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,889
cyber awareness campaign that we did,

647
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,450
we have to raise that awareness

648
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,150
to promote good cyber hygiene,

649
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,203
also take that into the
prevention include as well.

650
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,899
So I'd like to thank you all
very much for your time today.

651
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,361
I'll be taking questions,

652
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,880
I also have some questions coming through

653
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,300
when I look across at the moment
on the chat side of things,

654
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,110
so thank you very much, indeed.
