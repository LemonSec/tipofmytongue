14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,413
Hugh Thompson, RSA Conferences
Program Committee Chair.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,489
- Thanks Linda, and welcome everybody.

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,412
I hope you've had a great RSA Conference.

17
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:46,970
And thanks so much for
your time and attention

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,600
and your patience as we
adopt this, this new format

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,910
in interesting times, and I can tell you,

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,910
I am so excited about our
closing session, this year.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,490
We are privileged to have

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,950
one of my personal favorite actors.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,660
I'm a huge "Star Trek"
fan as many of you know.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,660
We have George Takei with
us who will be here shortly,

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,539
incredibly excited to talk to
George and get his thoughts.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,730
But before we get started I just wanted

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,370
to begin with a couple of comments

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,890
about the situation we
all now find ourselves in.

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,850
And I think doing things
over video conference,

30
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,850
having conversations, video
chats is now a multi time,

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,070
a day thing for most of us.

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,070
And a lot of adaptation has
had to happen by many of us

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,760
to be able to deal with this new reality.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,660
But I can tell you that

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,340
as Information Security Professionals,

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,820
this is an industry of change
that we embrace change.

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,289
In fact, I think we thrive on it

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,173
and I wanted to share with you,

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,090
a personal security
story that happened to me

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,610
as I've sort of gone through this change

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,790
and have been preparing for
these video conferences.

42
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,780
I think one day I
clocked 14 hours on Zoom,

43
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,393
which is pretty amazing.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,959
And I wanted to tell you

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,640
about this particular Zoom conference

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,500
that I was on because
in these conferences,

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,100
because most people are
doing them from home,

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,040
you really get to see the
humanity of people, kids run in,

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,600
there's a path that comes over,

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,630
some kind of fire truck pulls up outside,

51
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,299
and it's a very, very, very interesting,

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,682
more intimate look and
into somebody's life.

53
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:59,060
And so I'm on this call,
it's a very important one.

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,020
It's very, very intense.

55
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,100
There's quite a few regulators
and lawmakers on it,

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,420
and I'm talking about
something very technical,

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,500
a BGP, Border Gateway
Protocol and how it works.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,830
And I'm trying to explain
it to politicians.

59
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,830
And I just glance up to my right,

60
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,130
just like this and as as I'm speaking

61
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,130
and I'd gone into this room
that was as isolated as possible

62
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,760
from our five kids to try
and kind of minimize chaos.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,760
And I see the largest spider
that I have ever seen,

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,280
not in captivity during that glance.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,686
And he is slowly descending down

66
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,090
and the trajectory would put him

67
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,090
kinda right on the top of my
head in six to seven seconds.

68
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,117
So I'm looking at the
spider at the same time

69
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:02,859
I'm very engaged in my explanation.

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,480
And so I quickly then just
close it off with a phrase

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,200
that I find, you can
use at almost any time

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,200
in any circumstance, which is
the data speaks for itself.

73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,820
And then I shut the video off

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,170
and then absolute chaos
breaks out in the room.

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,273
And my hand goes up as I move it away,

76
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,670
I kinda hit the spider.

77
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,460
He goes to the edge of the room

78
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,090
and then I start trash talking this spider

79
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,080
'cause I can't find him like,
"Show yourself, come on out,

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,490
you're no match for me,
or your time's come."

81
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,090
All of this stuff.

82
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,109
And then maybe a minute
later I just resolved

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,630
that I wouldn't find the spider anymore,

84
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,710
at least during this call.

85
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,243
So I sat back down and realized

86
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:58,580
that while I had turned the camera off,

87
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,580
I had not un-muted or I
had not muted the session.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
And so I came back to
four or five text messages

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,450
with, are you okay?

90
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,620
Is everything fine?

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,400
Should I call someone?

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
So I can only imagine how
that sounded to a third party,

93
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,010
but only bring this up
because what we're seeing

94
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,289
in these times is the humanity of people.

95
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,551
We're people first, before
we're anything else.

96
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:34,150
And I am so excited about this session

97
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,620
because I get to have it

98
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,390
with one of the most
positive people that I know.

99
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,390
So George Takei is an absolute
legend in the acting world.

100
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,330
Those of you who like myself

101
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,800
ended up in the technology
field, grew up on "Star Trek".

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,760
It's how we even related to each other.

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,710
It's how you have models of the world.

104
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,710
And so excited to have George here with us

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
to chat about the human element
of technology and security.

106
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,690
George, welcome, thanks
so much for being here.

107
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,940
- Good to be joining you
here, we are RSA Conference.

108
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,520
I spoke at the February
conference very briefly.

109
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,289
And so it's wonderful to
be rejoining you again

110
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,750
for a more intimate conversation.

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,660
- Oh, thanks for coming back.

112
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,450
And I loved your speech,
very, very aspirational

113
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,340
and everything you do
feels like that to me,

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,539
I know that there's almost
an engine of positivity

115
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,550
that lives in you, that
that kind of comes out

116
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,230
and reverberates in everything you do,

117
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,100
at least that's how it feels to me.

118
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,160
- And well, that was "Star
Trek" to be positive.

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,660
The creator of "Star Trek"
was Gene Roddenberry,

120
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,510
who was a real visionary.

121
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,599
And he wanted to use television

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,630
to project that view or
that vision of the future

123
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,630
by commenting on what was
going on at that time.

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,010
And it was very difficult to do that

125
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,599
because this is television,
it's an advertising medium,

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,083
and there's handrails, very constraining.

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,870
He wanted to deal, the
'60s was a turbulent time,

128
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,920
not unlike our times today.

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,796
We had the civil rights
movement coming to a head.

130
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:41,796
We had the Vietnam War and
that was dividing this country

131
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,830
those that were pro-war and
others that were pro-peace.

132
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,700
And there was a cold war going,

133
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,212
at this probably hardness
most frozen point.

134
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,580
And he wants to make all
those commentaries on that.

135
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,120
And so he found the key
to doing it, metaphor.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,120
To use metaphor as a means
of commenting on the times

137
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:13,969
with an optimistic view of the future.

138
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,730
And so what he came up
with was science fiction

139
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,730
and a starship boldly going
where no one has gone before.

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,240
And this starship was a
metaphor for starship earth.

141
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,309
And the strength of this
starship was in its diversity.

142
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,099
That was the problem we were
having back into the '60s,

143
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,490
the inability to deal with diversity.

144
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,490
Whether it was race or
political thought or ideology.

145
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,740
And what was necessary
was to see that diversity

146
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,450
as a strength of this starship.

147
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,980
Because each part of that diversity

148
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,310
has a unique way of looking to the future

149
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,310
and solving problems and where
one view might be lacking.

150
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,735
The other part of that diversity
might be able to fill it.

151
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:18,180
So we saw that a diversity metaphorically

152
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,469
on this metaphorical starship

153
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,490
represented by the diversity of our planet

154
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,200
at that time, the captain
was a North American.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
The first officer was in himself diverse.

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
His mother was an earthwoman
with all her positives,

157
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,757
but also the human feelings

158
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:45,757
and the father was a
Vulcan, a supremely rational

159
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,217
and cool and calm and collected race

160
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,770
and Spock was the first officer

161
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,770
combining the best of the
two, the rational thinking,

162
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,630
the strong driving at the
solution to the problem

163
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,520
and the mother giving him a
touch of humanity, compassion,

164
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,960
and so he combined all that,

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,730
but this this planet at that time

166
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,160
was more diverse and the issue was race.

167
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,160
And so we had a black
woman, an African woman,

168
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,689
as our communications officer,

169
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,690
we had as representing
Europe, the Scottish Engineer,

170
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,540
my character was to represent Asia.

171
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,520
And so you saw that
diversity metaphorically

172
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,350
on this starship.

173
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,330
And the storytelling was
also in terms of metaphor.

174
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,080
- And what an impact that series,

175
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,700
and then the movies afterwards.

176
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,440
And I gotta say I was
very pleasantly surprised

177
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,889
to see you in that captain's chair

178
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,110
during that movie.

179
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,610
- It was about time.

180
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,830
- Very well deserved, I
agree, it was about time.

181
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,359
- A whole new series and
two or three decades,

182
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:28,359
and finally Sue, starkly it is
supposed to be a meritocracy.

183
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,650
And each one of us kept
getting advances in title.

184
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:39,775
I became a lieutenant
commander and then a commander,

185
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,787
but there I was at that
same Old Elm Council saying,

186
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:49,558
"I aisle walked through here."

187
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:54,200
Their substance of those
advances had to be reflected.

188
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,270
And I kept, George Takei kept
lobbying Gene Roddenberry

189
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,930
for some kind of a visual

190
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,849
and substantive reflection
of that advance.

191
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,400
And finally in "Star Trek VI",

192
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,870
The Undiscovered Country,
Sulu God is just rewards.

193
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,940
- Alright, came to fruition.

194
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,170
Oh my God, it's gonna be incredible

195
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,294
to have been just a part of that journey.

196
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:28,294
Is that I use metaphors from
"Star Trek" maybe too much,

197
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,550
but all the time to describe things

198
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,209
or it was an incredible vehicle,

199
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,200
not just to describe how
we may interact in a world

200
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,620
where technology makes us more connected.

201
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,398
It absolutely did that.

202
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:49,010
And I would argue it
helped it help Genesis

203
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,203
some of those technologies, right?

204
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,150
But if you look at each
episode, it was so human.

205
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,800
It was about emotion and struggles.

206
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,800
And how do we persevere through an issue

207
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,079
and have hope that we can
get on the other side of it?

208
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,170
And if we didn't have that hope,

209
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,067
we wouldn't have gotten
on the other side of it.

210
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:18,360
And it was very inspirational,
I thought that way.

211
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,730
- And finding in ourselves,

212
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,620
in our human selves, the solution.

213
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,230
For example, the "Star
Trek IV, The Voyage Home",

214
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,460
we had this strange baffling situation.

215
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,280
And we found out that what we were doing

216
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,030
in the 20th century with
the the environment,

217
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,470
and that was what was causing the problem.

218
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,347
And so what we simply
did was technologically

219
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:49,347
go back in time to earth and
the United States in a decade.

220
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,536
I think we were in about the '70s or '80s.

221
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,780
And we went back to San Francisco

222
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,780
and we had some difficulty
adjusting to a 20th century,

223
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,620
San Francisco, for example

224
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,180
Scotty was presented with a computer

225
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,507
and he said, "Oh, yes, I
know this is a 20th century."

226
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,760
And he starts talking in at the computer.

227
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,257
- I remember that thing
now that you said it.

228
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:30,219
- They pointed to the mouse,

229
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,080
and says, "Oh, yes, of course."

230
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
And he grabs the mouse
and says, "Computer."

231
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,319
(both laugh)

232
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,120
So we find humor, but also
we found the solution.

233
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,010
We found that it was what
we were doing with whales

234
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,210
that was contributing to the
problems in the 23rd century.

235
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,210
And so Spock as the wise
one led us to the solution.

236
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,610
And we made a small
contribution to the preservation

237
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:03,864
of the founder of the 20th century

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,600
or the ocean sea life
of 20th century world.

239
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,843
So-
- Remember that one.

240
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:17,050
- Always story telling
finding the solution

241
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,313
in our human problem solving capabilities.

242
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,098
- That's fantastic and to that point,

243
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:28,099
is something that almost struck me,

244
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,164
and you tell me, I mean,
you're the expert on this,

245
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:34,460
you create, help to build it.

246
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,100
- I was a hired actor, their real genius,

247
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,400
the brain, was Gene Roddenberry.

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,760
And the fantastically
creative writing staff,

249
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,987
that script was, both "Star Trek IV"

250
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,699
and VI were written by Nich Meyer,

251
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,530
brilliant writer, and a true visionary.

252
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,089
And he really understood
Gene Roddenberry's philosophy

253
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,113
of Infinite Diversity in
Infinite Combinations.

254
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,200
- Oh, I love that concept.

255
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,710
When I was first
articulated in "Star Trek."

256
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,205
It just, it really
expands your mind and that

257
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,920
this is a place, yeah.
- (indistinct)

258
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Well, as we said in that
talk in San Francisco,

259
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,087
some of us are hunters,
we seek out and find facts

260
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,860
and scientifically other
facts, others are gathers,

261
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,440
we collect, and we assemble and invent,

262
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,090
others are builders, they build structures

263
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,260
or they build, take an idea

264
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,260
and organize it and build
corporations and enterprises.

265
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
And so it's the human element
in our diversity in all these,

266
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
and then, and particularly
for me, the outliers,

267
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,230
the dreamers, the artists, the poets

268
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,002
that also make their contributions

269
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,423
not quite a technologically,

270
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,649
an artist use technology to tell the human

271
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,043
or they produce human creative works.

272
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,350
But it's in ourselves, it's a human selves

273
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,740
that eventually find the solution.

274
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,009
We're problem solving creatures,

275
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:43,950
and we do it in many ways, gab
venturing forth or gathering,

276
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,850
or taking what's been gathered

277
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,429
and building on it
entrepreneurially or structurally.

278
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,430
So the core is our human
ability to solve problems.

279
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,770
And we can do it with whimsy,

280
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,440
we can do it with our
keen analytical mind,

281
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,440
we can do it with our
ability to think abstractly.

282
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,972
And so it's the diversity within ourselves

283
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,910
and in the human animal

284
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,600
and the diversity within that human animal

285
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,540
that helps find a
solution to the challenges

286
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,832
we face in this complex turbulent world.

287
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:36,785
- Absolutely, and just
hearing you talk about this

288
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,409
brings a new perspective to me

289
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,210
around some of those classic episodes

290
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,650
that I grew up watching.

291
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,160
And I think about how many times

292
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,880
Kirk had to make a call
that was a bold call.

293
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,700
In some cases people were
questioning his call.

294
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,050
But he had a group of folks around him

295
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,940
that were providing him
with different perspectives.

296
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,660
Spock was very analytical.

297
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,243
He would tell him-
- He was always there.

298
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,120
- And bonds almost seemed to
me to be the voice of pessimism

299
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,990
or Jim's hate, caution, like
maybe you shouldn't do it,

300
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,070
maybe it's like stand back from it.

301
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,419
And then there were all of
these voices that came in

302
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,160
and ultimately Kirk had to make decisions

303
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,992
that were meaningful based
on incomplete information

304
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,580
and make them boldly, right?

305
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,240
It's not just him that's making.

306
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,640
And he's gotta get the
whole ship behind him

307
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,640
as he does these things.

308
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,390
And then-
- And give Scotty some credit.

309
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,710
Although he kept complaining
about the laws of physics,

310
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,750
he was able to go beyond and
break the laws of physics

311
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,560
and find a solution to each
one of the characters in his

312
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,649
or her unique human
way, found the solution

313
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,650
to a seemingly baffling
and insolvable challenge.

314
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,110
- And there was always
this, the sense of optimism,

315
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,218
as you said, I mean, even just the phrase,

316
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:18,620
"Go boldly where no one has gone before."

317
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,270
Such as go where no one has gone before.

318
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,389
The word boldly seems to indicate that,

319
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,940
hey, we think something amazing

320
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,840
is on the other side of this,

321
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,409
and that's why we will go, but
not just go, but go boldly.

322
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,740
- And go with courage.

323
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,130
It takes courage and the confidence

324
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,130
to take a prudent,
informed risk, risk-taking.

325
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,350
- What you're saying and just reminds me

326
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,050
it's one thing to have to innovate

327
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,580
because there's a catalyst of tragedy

328
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,340
or a catalyst of something's changed

329
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,439
and we just have to adapt to it.

330
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
And it's another to voluntarily
just sort of boldly go

331
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,367
and kind of create the future.

332
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:11,168
I think one of the things
that we're seeing now

333
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:14,290
is the current crisis that we're in

334
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,909
pushing the bounds of
innovation in so many ways.

335
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,931
Like I even think about this conversation

336
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:25,760
that we're having, there
are so many more people

337
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,180
that are going to be a part
of RSA Conferences here

338
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,570
because it is virtual and
because they don't have to travel

339
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,230
and because they can sit
in their living rooms

340
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,780
and be a part of it.

341
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,780
And it's an interesting unintended
consequence of adapting.

342
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,750
We often talk about the bad
unintended consequences,

343
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,543
but there are a lot of good ones, too.

344
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,428
- Whatever catastrophe,
disaster that we have

345
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:02,420
it's for our mind, the human
mind to do something with

346
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,850
and Ground Zero at the
Old World Trade Center

347
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,459
is an example of it, today it's dazzling,

348
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,460
and today we're in another
catastrophic situation,

349
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,700
not just the pandemic,
but the justice issue,

350
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,730
the police brutality against
black men, Black Lives Matter,

351
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,160
but out of this will come a better society

352
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,420
because we are problem solvers.

353
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,310
We can tap up particularly
under pressure like this,

354
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:45,310
the creative mind, the problem
solving mind and boldly go.

355
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,450
And it takes that what you
said, boldness, risk-taking,

356
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,773
that venture some people
say it can't be done.

357
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,419
And Scotty could say the laws of physics,

358
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,980
but you go beyond the laws of physics

359
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,950
because (indistinct).
- Away this laws.

360
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,947
They're just suggestions, not laws.

361
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:10,363
(both laugh)

362
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,210
George, I can't thank you enough

363
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,250
for being a part of this, like I tell you,

364
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,970
there's never been a more
important time for this industry

365
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,970
to get an infusion of
George Takei in my opinion.

366
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,070
And it's just so amazing

367
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,010
getting your perspective on things.

368
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,499
You're very, very inspiring.

369
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:39,499
- As this greeting goes, it
means live long and prosper.

370
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,370
And we will prosper because
we're gonna live long.

371
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,312
My grandmother celebrated 104 birthdays,

372
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:55,312
and she really did celebrate
each one of her birthdays.

373
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,450
And after she reached 90,

374
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,410
she started lying, women
lie about their age,

375
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,010
but my grandmother lied
in the opposite direction.

376
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,610
She was telling people, she was 91,

377
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,120
and we said, "No, no bachan."

378
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,340
A bachan is grandma in the Japanese.

379
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,320
We said, "No, no bachan, you're 90."

380
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,240
But she says, "No, no, no, I'm Japanese.

381
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,030
She was the immigrant generation.

382
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,543
I'm Japanese, I count the Japanese way.

383
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:27,010
(both laugh)

384
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,010
And she was justifying 91,
but when she turned 91,

385
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,990
she was telling people she was 94.

386
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,247
and I was like,
- Wow, it's exponential.

387
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:39,738
- "That's not Japanese
way of counting at all."

388
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:44,420
But she did legitimately,
reality, not virtually,

389
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,980
in reality, celebrate 104 birthdays.

390
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,810
And she lived a very full rich life.

391
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,810
And her grandson, me,
I'm a competitive type.

392
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,355
I plan to beat my grandmother.

393
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,970
(both laugh loudly)

394
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,803
I'm gonna live and prosper.

395
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,039
- We really need your words on that.

396
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,678
I'm glad you got the genes

397
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:14,970
and the attitude working in your favor.

398
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,430
- And I don't need my
Japanese way of counting.

399
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,076
I'm gonna legitimately
reach 105 and six and seven.

400
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,042
(laughs)

401
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:28,042
- Alright, we will bring you
back on a hundred and fifth.

402
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:30,409
(laughs loudly)

403
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,150
Let's start to show that, yes,

404
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,650
it was here at RSA
Conference so you said it,

405
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,160
and then you've actually achieved.

406
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,160
- Yes, because RSA too
will live long and prosper.

407
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,830
And develop the shields that I
called for in "Star Trek VI".

408
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:51,310
- Okay, I gotta go back to that movie now

409
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,870
and see exactly what
you did to recreate it.

410
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,870
- Hugh, that cyber
security, cyber protection.

411
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,770
(both laugh)

412
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,360
- But George, thank you so much.

413
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,310
It's just been a real treat
getting to talk to you,

414
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,679
and I really, really
appreciate your perspective.

415
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,823
You're just fantastic.
