I'd now like to turn it over to Erich Kron

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,493
and Javvad Malik for the presentation.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,387
- Hello, everybody,
welcome to our session,

11
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:37,910
"Getting Engagement in
the Midst of Chaos."

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm Javvad Malik and alongside me

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,053
is my wonderful colleague, Erich Kron.

14
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,480
(mouse clicking)

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,059
- It's great to be here, Javvad,

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,810
yeah, if you've ever heard of
me, I don't know if you have,

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,150
my background, I've been in
IT and security since gosh,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,690
mid-1990s is when I got into this.

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,699
I've always been a big
fan of the human element,

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,900
so that's kind of what I
focused on throughout my career,

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,620
but if you have a CISSP,
something like that,

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,410
you may have got a letter
from me in the last few years.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,850
That's one of the things that I did

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,780
as a Director of Member Relations
and Services for (ISC)2.

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,780
But as I said, we've been
very focused over the years

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,470
on the human element,

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,410
which is something Javvad
and I are gonna talk about

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,720
quite a bit right here, Javvad?

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,230
- Yeah, sure, so this is me,
despite my youthful young looks

30
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,010
I have been working in the
industry for about 20 years.

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,970
It was my first job, IT
Security and a bit consulting,

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,450
and a bit of consulting and
I was an industry analyst.

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,310
And you know, maybe you've been on YouTube

34
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,700
and you've seen a few videos of mine

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,020
and that's really what,

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,130
I wanted a way to try and explain security

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,310
to the average person and
that's what got me attached

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,390
to, well you know, we have
a lot of technical solutions

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,310
for things, but we're
not really that great

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,330
at or we don't, didn't back
in the day have many resources

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,810
for educating people or
connecting with them,

42
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,570
so that's what brought me
to this stage of my career,

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,820
but, the talk we are going to do,

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,523
it's a three act show.

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,820
We're gonna talk about
some of the disruptions.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,850
We're gonna talk about some of the attacks

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,950
that are happening against home workers.

48
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,890
And then finally, we will go into

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,322
what defenses we can deploy.

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,580
So disruptions, what
disruptions are we seeing?

51
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,920
Eric, talk us through this photo, please.

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,190
- Yeah, this is pretty interesting,

53
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,340
this is the Imperial Palace there in Tokyo

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,530
and what we notice here right away,

55
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,760
is that people have been out and about,

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,410
far less than they originally were, right?

57
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,500
I don't know about you,
but my travel schedule

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,020
has definitely changed, like
how often I'm on the road

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,502
and things like that.

60
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,100
This is a couple of pictures,
this was back in February

61
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
and then again in April, and you'll see,

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,560
there were 63% less cars on the road.

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,470
And so it's definitely
impacted a lot of our habits,

64
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,563
even just in how we get out and about.

65
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,300
- And that's stretching
the physical world,

66
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,860
but in the online world,
we've seen spikes in traffic

67
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,230
and unfortunately one of those spikes

68
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,260
has been in the number of phishing emails,

69
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,410
relating to the pandemic, so you'll see,

70
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,220
like from about March onwards,

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,020
there's almost been a vertical rise

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,530
in the number of phishing
emails out in the world,

73
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,080
that have been latching
onto the COVID-19 pandemic.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,810
We have this broken down
in this chart by waves,

75
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,700
so you see wave one, this is
a way, think of it like this.

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,579
It's gone from just a custom thing

77
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,440
that a few people are trying
out, which was wave one.

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,780
Wave two is where it
begins to get traction,

79
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,730
and you see like ancillary
services topped it,

80
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,906
so it's not just the CDC or
the United Nations saying,

81
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,677
"Hey, here's a healthcare

82
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:46,417
"that has something to do
with the health of COVID-19,

83
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:47,420
"click here."

84
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,670
But then we get other institutes
being spoofed as well,

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,867
like your bank will be like,

86
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,036
"You're entitled to some payments

87
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,410
"or government relief" and "Click here."

88
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,410
And wave three is the scary part,

89
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,090
which is where we see
criminals actually package

90
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,210
all of these together
into their phishing kits.

91
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,480
So if you go on the Dark Web
or wherever they're trading,

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,850
and you wanna pay a bad guy to give them,

93
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,150
give you a phishing kit,
that's pre-packaged templates

94
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,140
that you can send out to
victims of your choice.

95
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,329
You will get a whole bunch

96
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,100
of customizable COVID-19-related
phishing templates there.

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,560
And that's where you see
the bulk of them coming in.

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,873
So it's really quite scary stuff.

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,039
- Yeah, absolutely, and the
world has had to adjust to this,

100
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,760
not only to, you know, the differences

101
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,150
in how we're getting out physically,

102
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,710
but the other things that
are happening as well,

103
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,710
like you showed just there,
I mean, it's amazing to me

104
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,020
that we had such a big spike
in the number of things there.

105
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,520
Now, part of this and part
of what's complicating this

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,729
is the fact that a lot of
information has been put out

107
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,370
about a lot of big things,
you know, for example here,

108
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,780
the Tokyo Olympics and cancellations

109
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,859
with large sporting events
and other things like that

110
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,230
around the world it's
definitely taken its toll.

111
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,470
But what's happened in is a lot of cases,

112
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,040
the organizations or the governments

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,240
behind the changes that are happening,

114
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,900
haven't actually been able to
get the complete information

115
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,186
to people.

116
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,900
And so that makes it very
right for phishing attacks,

117
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,989
if you give somebody some
information, like here in the US,

118
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,870
they said everybody's
gotta work from home,

119
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,390
but then they didn't really give them

120
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,180
a whole lot of guidance
as to how that worked

121
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,870
and what that meant and
things to watch out for

122
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,690
and what you need to do
to actually accomplish it.

123
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,580
So the bad guys were able to take that

124
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,450
and then turn around very quickly

125
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,860
and pray on that, promising to give you

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,260
that missing bit of information.

127
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,130
And that's one of the reasons

128
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,010
the fishing stuff went so crazy.

129
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,380
Now we know that it impacted
the economy as well,

130
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,840
uncertainty drives concern obviously,

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,669
the economic changes,
the prices have gone up,

132
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,790
I shop a lot on Amazon.com

133
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,600
and I've noticed that a
lot of the common things

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,150
that I used to get on Amazon,

135
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,620
either the prices have gone way, way up,

136
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,340
especially things like, here in the US,

137
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,840
plexiglass or the clear acrylic sheets

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,270
that everyone is now using
between the registers,

139
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,570
those prices went way up

140
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,990
and it is extremely
hard to find these days,

141
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,050
along with the other normal things

142
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,800
and of course, you know, this is something

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,220
that we understand people are concerned,

144
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,540
they're worried about it,
they're panic buying, right?

145
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,240
It was kinda like what
happened in the beginning,

146
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,350
where everybody bought
a lot of toilet paper

147
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,360
and you couldn't get toilet paper

148
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,100
in the stores here, you know.

149
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,410
It's a silly thing to do,
but everyone was afraid,

150
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,100
they're like, what happens
if I run out of that, right?

151
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,160
That's a pretty major deal.

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,620
Now the thing is, this has happened before

153
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,173
and it continues to happen,
it will happen again.

154
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,100
We see this kind of stuff

155
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,730
because of the uncertainty with natural

156
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,410
and unnatural events,
whenever there are major news,

157
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,730
breaking events, things like that,

158
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,780
it is always going to be
something that's followed up

159
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,869
by phishing attacks

160
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,040
or some sort of social
engineering attacks.

161
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,660
I live in Florida here, we
deal with a lot of weather

162
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,180
every year, and what happens

163
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,570
is we end up running out of plywood

164
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,110
to put up over our windows and water

165
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,570
and it happens every
year during this time.

166
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,420
But the anxiety drives that panic buying,

167
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,970
which is kind of a scary thing.

168
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,969
- And talking about an unexpected cases,

169
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,940
this is something I
picked up on in the news,

170
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,060
and I thought it was just
a really good example

171
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,450
of how we don't know what all
the things in the supply chain

172
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,870
that are gonna be impacted by
something about the pandemic

173
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,490
so in San Diego if you
were a buyer of meths,

174
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,370
not that I advocate
anyone actually buys meth,

175
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,090
you'd see that there was
a 40% increase in price,

176
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,789
why, because Wuhan has a cottage industry,

177
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,390
apparently there where they
supply the raw elements

178
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,530
that are used to make meth

179
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,760
and they couldn't get out of the country

180
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,469
because they were on lockdown

181
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,980
and cargo planes were grounded,

182
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,210
the Mexican cartels were the
biggest importer of this drug

183
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,130
and they couldn't get their hands on it.

184
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,790
On top of that, the border
between Mexico and the US

185
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,100
was completely shut
because of the pandemic,

186
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,170
so as a result, less supply, more demand

187
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,703
and prices shot up.

188
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,720
So this brings us on to
like, what does this mean

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,060
for home workers and I
think this is a good way

190
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,080
of visualizing why attacking home workers

191
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,870
is a really good strategy for bad guys,

192
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,380
I mean good from their perspective,

193
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,350
not from our perspective obviously.

194
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,190
And the three key areas are
there, there are mental issues

195
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,960
in the sense that people are
anxious, people are worried,

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,719
people are looking for information,

197
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,340
they want to know whether
they've still got a job,

198
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,159
whether they're gonna get paid or not.

199
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,659
These organizational challenges,

200
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,069
like, many organizations were not prepared

201
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,520
to go remote workforce or do
enforce social distancing.

202
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,280
So you know, they've
been trying to struggle

203
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,280
and try to roll out fixes, in
many cases, lowering security.

204
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,790
And then the third element,
there is the home environment,

205
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,380
when someone is working
from home all the time,

206
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,680
they don't have the security
or the luxury of protections

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,719
of working within your
corporate environment.

208
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,390
So all of these things coming together

209
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,430
make that perfect storm of
why attacking home workers

210
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,223
is such a lucrative business
for criminals these days.

211
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,810
This is kind of like a visualization,

212
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,050
where home workers are
like blood in the water

213
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,863
and the criminals are sharks.

214
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,173
So this is a good example like Shodan

215
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,260
they release a blog
and they showed a spike

216
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,220
in the number of RDP ports that
were exposed to the Internet

217
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,323
as soon as homeworking started.

218
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:39,199
And really in a lot of
cases, this is just people,

219
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,520
trying to ensure that, you
know, their systems work

220
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,590
so they're putting in
place these quick fixes,

221
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,360
it's kind of like technical
debt that they're accruing

222
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,116
and we can't say it's necessarily wrong,

223
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:54,290
because they're trynna keep
the business on the road

224
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,560
but keep in mind that
you're putting in place

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,599
all these changes

226
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,620
and you need to wind these back at a point

227
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,090
or you need to monitor these,

228
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,730
'cause the bad guys certainly are,

229
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,790
because where you've got Shodan
reporting a spike in RDP,

230
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,480
you've got Kaspersky release this report,

231
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,810
saying that RDP forces
have increased so, so much,

232
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,400
so if you're an organization

233
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,449
that is desperately trynna
get your employees working

234
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,500
and you're implementing
these kinds of controls

235
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,330
or maybe you're not rolling
out 2FA, or monitoring controls

236
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,570
then you know, you're gonna be blind

237
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,033
to a lot of these attacks.

238
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,210
- Yeah, absolutely Javad

239
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,460
and you know, there's some new tools

240
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,000
that people started
using with this, right?

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,010
Along with RDP, a lot of people

242
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,434
went to these other
collaboration platforms,

243
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:38,300
you know, you have a lot of people

244
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,660
that have never touched
a collaboration platform

245
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,660
in their lives and all of
a sudden, their whole day

246
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,010
circles around these
collaboration platforms,

247
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,170
things like Zoom and we saw
them being heavily targeted,

248
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,849
you know, and it started out
with some smaller things,

249
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,620
you know, the Zoobombing,
and a lot of that was caused,

250
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,870
really because people didn't
know how to set up the rooms

251
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,850
or the meetings in a
secure fashion, right?

252
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,500
They just open a room up

253
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
and then whoever had
the link could come in.

254
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,320
And people were, you know, the bad guys,

255
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,520
they were thrown in random
letter sets and things

256
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,240
and just popping into these
things and doing bad things.

257
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,070
Now the other thing that happened is,

258
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,750
because it took off so much,

259
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,330
now all of a sudden, the
bad guys have pivoted

260
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,080
and focused on this, because
they know that it's in use,

261
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,040
way more than it ever was before,

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,469
so they start focusing some
efforts on that, right?

263
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,950
We always put our
efforts towards something

264
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,570
that's going to give us the best return.

265
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,990
And so when they do that,
they're finding vulnerabilities.

266
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,690
Same thing with security researchers,

267
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,030
they went "Whoa, wait a
minute, this has taken off,"

268
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,579
they turn their effort on
that and they start seeing

269
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,820
a lot of these vulnerabilities as well.

270
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,040
So there was a lot of stuff

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,880
that happened around that,
there was a lot of scariness,

272
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,910
honestly that went around that,

273
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,010
there are still companies
that will not use Zoom,

274
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,890
because of some of their
earlier things that were found.

275
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,970
There was even a case where
there were a bunch of usernames

276
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,510
and passwords supposedly from Zoom

277
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,550
that were dumped out
there, but a lot of that

278
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,900
was actually from previous breaches,

279
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,550
or what they had done is
they'd taken those credentials

280
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,650
from previous breaches and
tested them on the Zoom platform

281
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,230
using credential stuffing or something

282
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,080
and found out that they do in fact work,

283
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,230
so that's actually how a
lot of those got out there.

284
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,210
It wasn't necessarily always the platform,

285
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,260
but people were not used to that.

286
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,310
Now, what we have to
understand in these days

287
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,849
is with the stress of
using these new platforms

288
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,070
and all this other stuff
that we just talked about,

289
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,610
attackers use psychology against us

290
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,390
and what they do is they a lot
of times attack our emotions.

291
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,449
Well, the first thing
we have to understand,

292
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,180
is our brain's job is to filter,

293
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,329
interpret and present
reality, the things we taste,

294
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,360
the things we smell, the
things we feel, okay?

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,200
Those are all reality to us,

296
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,310
but our brain does a lot of filtering.

297
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,530
And just to give you an example,

298
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,400
if you take and you look left, look right

299
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,240
with your eyes right now,

300
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,890
you probably don't see your nose, right?

301
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,010
But that's because your
brain actually filters it out

302
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,140
of your vision.

303
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,610
It's a thing that your
brain does automatically,

304
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,280
if you wear glasses like I do,

305
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,730
I don't see my glasses
until I think about it.

306
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,010
This is your brain doing that.

307
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,270
Well the attackers, a lot of
times, will use psychology,

308
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,829
they'll use emotions
in order to turn around

309
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,770
and attack that portion.

310
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,680
It's really quite amazing
how well this works

311
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,620
and this brings us to Social Engineering.

312
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,140
During these times, it's crazy.

313
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,540
Now, social engineering generally
has a bad, like term to it

314
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,290
but it can also be used for good,

315
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,030
like getting people to
pay attention to training

316
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,600
which we'll talk about in a little bit,

317
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,980
but when it comes to the bad side,

318
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,110
we need to understand,
are we being manipulated

319
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,590
and they use greed like
the Nigerian Prince scams

320
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,050
that we've, you know, heard of.

321
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,079
Curiosity like clickbait
adds, self-interest.

322
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,450
Urgency is a big one too,

323
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,310
there's very rarely,
have I ever even thought

324
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,849
to adhear of you know a phishing attack

325
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,570
or a vishing or smishing
attack, which is voice

326
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,090
or text message phishing as well,

327
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,520
that says something along
the lines of, you know

328
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,120
whenever you feel like it,

329
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,930
go ahead and take care of this, right?

330
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,786
It's always like, "Oh,
something's going on,

331
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:02,980
"we're in an acquisition" or
"Something's happening here,"

332
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,990
there's always a sense of urgency to it

333
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,570
and then of course
fear, people get scared.

334
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,760
There's threats against people,

335
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,270
if something bad is gonna happen
if you don't reply to this,

336
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,720
and then there's the helpfulness

337
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,280
and we see that here in the US sometimes,

338
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,927
with the phone calls that say,

339
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,297
"Hey your nephew's in
jail, this is his lawyer,

340
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,970
"we need you to post bond
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

341
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,270
there's that kind of stuff
too that happens as well

342
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,030
but these are all emotional attacks

343
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,500
and they're designed to get us
to kind of mess up what it is

344
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,000
we're doing or impact our actions.

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,500
Now, social media is a key point of this,

346
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,160
there is so much stuff going
on on social media these days,

347
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,449
with the misinformation it's incredible.

348
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,760
There was a Carnegie
Mellon study over here

349
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
on the right hand side,

350
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,040
they were talking about, in
the beginning especially,

351
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,550
the tweets about Coronavirus,
about half of them

352
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,680
were actually bots or bot-like behavior.

353
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,380
And so these things are being amplified,

354
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,130
they're being put out
there, there's a lot of fear

355
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,830
and anxiety that's going on through these

356
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,740
and then here in the US we have
the issue with George Floyd

357
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,260
which has gone worldwide at this point.

358
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,600
But they found that
almost or more than half

359
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,650
of the social media posts about that,

360
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,540
we're either from bots
or from known trolls,

361
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,219
people that are just trying
to stir up more anxiety

362
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,100
and something we don't
think about very often

363
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,040
is mental fatigue.

364
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,819
As we process this stuff every day,

365
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,900
our brains actually get tired.

366
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,180
We don't feel it like our
arms and legs get tired

367
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,900
but our brain definitely gets tired.

368
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,069
So this is the kind of stuff
that they throw at them

369
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,170
in emails, you know you can
see these sorts of things,

370
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,410
very much you know, fear-based attacks,

371
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,439
they wanna get somebody to do something.

372
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,737
So now we have to engage
in the defense, Javad.

373
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:48,360
- Yeah, thank you Eric for scaring us all,

374
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,610
I'm certainly worried about things now.

375
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,670
But so let's get into some
of the defensive tactics

376
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,099
and one thing we in the security world

377
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,480
as security professionals,
we always say, have a plan.

378
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,970
Have a plan of action
for when things go wrong,

379
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,970
but to quote my favorite
philosopher, Iron Mike Tyson,

380
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,177
"Everybody has a plan

381
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,990
"until they get punched in the mouth."

382
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,830
And this is so true because, you know,

383
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,750
just giving people information

384
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,150
or just telling people
that, "Hey you're at risk,"

385
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,480
does not actually change their behavior.

386
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,700
And so we as security professionals,

387
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,440
we need to ask ourselves,
like do you care more

388
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,440
about what your employees
know or how they behave.

389
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,339
And that is a critical,
critical point here, you know,

390
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:39,920
it doesn't matter whether
they can recite, you know,

391
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,349
all your policies backwards,

392
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,230
if that doesn't result in
changed behavior, it won't work.

393
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,140
Example I like to use, is
I'm driving along the road,

394
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,140
it's late, the roads are
empty, there's dry conditions,

395
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,730
I've got a powerful car and
the speed limit says 30.

396
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,610
Well I'm aware the speed limit is 30,

397
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,730
but will it change my behavior?

398
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,349
And that's not something
I'm gonna discuss on camera,

399
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,663
but I think it's important
to have realistic goals,

400
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,000
because humans are complex creatures

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,069
and if you've tried anything in your life,

402
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,700
you know that change,

403
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,119
you can only make small changes at a time.

404
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,060
Apparently, the most of
our habits you can change

405
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,839
at any one point, is
three, any more than that

406
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,949
and you just won't be able to cope.

407
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,900
So say you wanna sleep
less, you wanna eat clean

408
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,180
and you wanna train more.

409
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,040
So for example, if you try to
do those, you might succeed

410
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,159
but if you try to do anything
more than that, you say

411
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,200
and also I want to learn
how to play the piano

412
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,380
and also I want to get a degree

413
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,510
and, you know, and, and, and.

414
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,730
You're gonna fail at all of them,

415
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,810
so we need to set realistic goals

416
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,679
in what we expect employees to do

417
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,300
and how they can better defend themselves.

418
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,310
A good example is from
the world of marketing

419
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,659
and marketing is, like
Eric, like you said earlier,

420
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,310
it's kinda like the positive
spin on social engineering.

421
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,860
You're trying to deliver a
message to someone continuously.

422
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,860
When I was young in the 80's,
growing up here in the UK,

423
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,235
there was this campaign called

424
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,730
Clunk Click, Even on the shortest trips,

425
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,717
and that was to get people to
wear seatbelts in their cars,

426
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,240
and it was just a short repeatable message

427
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,240
and it was repeated on TV,
on the radio, on billboards.

428
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,706
And it was drummed in time and time again

429
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:27,860
and it got to the point

430
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,070
where now I don't even think about it,

431
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,950
I just put on my seatbelt.

432
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,380
The interesting thing about
that is that now I have kids

433
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,900
and they just observe
me, my wife, other elders

434
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,740
just putting on their seatbelt
so as soon as they get in,

435
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,687
even my youngest, he
will like, get on the car

436
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,620
and say "Dad, seatbelt, seatbelt."

437
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,149
So you know, this is learnt
behavior through leadership,

438
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,420
so if you have good leaders,

439
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,420
if your execs are demonstrating
good security values,

440
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,530
they're living by it,
it becomes a lot easier

441
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,740
for even your untrained employees.

442
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,230
So my kids don't even know the reason,

443
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,720
they haven't been
exposed to this campaign,

444
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,030
yet they still abide by the values.

445
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,720
And this is what we mean
by, think like a marketer,

446
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,920
get them to change behavior,
not necessarily like,

447
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,543
bombard them with information.

448
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,110
This is a great example as I found.

449
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,729
Apparently they've been
made of sponge cake,

450
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,470
it's very popular in in Japan

451
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,230
and this is taken from their website

452
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,930
and if you just read
through the paragraphs,

453
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,840
is that our egg yolk is
different from other places,

454
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,620
we raise chickens in natural
valleys with organic grass

455
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,360
and corn to make the
yolk have a fresh color

456
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,290
and intense taste and that's
something quite visceral.

457
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,300
It invokes something in your brain,

458
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,133
you can almost taste,

459
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,990
I mean, I can almost
taste the cake right now

460
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,620
and that's not giving me
any bland information,

461
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,679
there's not a spreadsheet
of nutrients or calories

462
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,120
or anything, it's just describing it

463
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,699
and this is where we often go wrong

464
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,640
when you look at how we treat users.

465
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,940
We say well setup MFA or you
know, choose a strong password

466
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,210
or do this or just do that
and that's the wrong approach,

467
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,850
because we're not invoking
anything on the emotional level,

468
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,790
we're not bringing them into our world,

469
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,480
we're just speaking at them

470
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,893
and that's where a lot
of training goes wrong.

471
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,440
Nudges are a great example of how you can,

472
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,165
without forcing someone,

473
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:29,070
you build them the choice
architecture that gives them

474
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,100
the impotence to do the right thing

475
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,379
or the thing that is the desired behavior.

476
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,970
So you can see these stairs,
they're also I think from Japan

477
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,950
but they have calories written on them,

478
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,040
so if you take one step
it's half a calorie,

479
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,860
if you take you know, and
so it's psychologically,

480
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,280
you're encouraging
people to use the stairs,

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,715
get fit or as opposed
to using the escalator.

482
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:55,439
The yellow sign is a
cigarette butt disposer

483
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,970
and to encourage people or to nudge them

484
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,520
to throw their cigarette butts in there,

485
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
they've asked the question,

486
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,920
who's the best player in the
world, is it Ronaldo or Messi?

487
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,410
And I can see Eric looking
with a blank stare,

488
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,010
being American, he has
no idea what football,

489
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,350
what he calls soccer actually
is, or who these players are

490
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,070
but I'm sure you'll all appreciate Ronaldo

491
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,637
is the better player.

492
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:19,270
And at the top you have
the example of passwords

493
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,290
and you know, this is a good example

494
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,260
that you're not forcing someone

495
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,200
to choose a really complex password

496
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,650
but you're giving them the
choice, you can choose that

497
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,880
as a password but it's not great

498
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,937
and psychologically you're
influencing someone's like,

499
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:34,756
"I don't want something
that says not great,

500
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:36,437
"I want the one that says great

501
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:38,330
"or the one with the smiley face."

502
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,060
So they'll keep making
their password more strong

503
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,803
until we hit that that point.

504
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,790
Eric?

505
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,100
- Yeah, absolutely you
know, it's interesting

506
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,419
when you're talking about
dealing with people,

507
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,160
you do need to build that engagement,

508
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,810
it has to be something that's, you know,

509
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,120
something that relates to them

510
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,699
and I think that cigarette butt thing

511
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,210
is very good example of that

512
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,000
for people that are into
those sports you know,

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,270
it makes them want to do something.

514
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,840
Now, when you're building
this engagement you know,

515
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,419
there's some learning
techniques that we wanna share.

516
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,410
These are things that we've learned

517
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,340
over stuff that we've done,

518
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,730
we've seen out there in the real world.

519
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,590
One of the biggest things I gotta say is,

520
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,419
we need to establish a
baseline and work from there.

521
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,170
A lot of places don't start
by establishing a baseline

522
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,940
and figuring out where they are.

523
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,190
One of the easiest ways to do this

524
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,620
is through fishing obviously,

525
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,469
and the attacks that come through that,

526
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,590
how many people are clicking on things.

527
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,820
That's a good thing to start with

528
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,120
and then you're gonna try
to shape that behavior.

529
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,350
So you determine where you are now,

530
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,209
you take the lessons, you
make it relatable to them.

531
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,420
You make it something that
they are going to care about,

532
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,820
not something that's
completely foreign to them.

533
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,940
You also wanna get your
leadership involved as well,

534
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,940
so like you mentioned with the seatbelts,

535
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,590
your kids see you do that

536
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,230
and so now this is an
accepted part of culture.

537
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,610
It is accepted and if they don't do that,

538
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,679
it actually feels a little weird, right?

539
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,980
And that's what you're going for.

540
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,590
Now leadership can be an
extremely strong influencer

541
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,360
in that and if they're on board,

542
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,330
having them publicly doing some
of the actions that you say,

543
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,290
will definitely make it more comfortable

544
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,710
for those that might feel
uncomfortable changing their way.

545
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,210
They'll have a little bit more confidence.

546
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,440
The other thing you can do,

547
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,840
and this is a fantastic tip that works,

548
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,939
is find some of the people
in your organization

549
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,250
that are already predisposed

550
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,290
to be somewhat security-conscious anyways.

551
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,820
Get those people on board with you

552
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,870
and have them demonstrate
those patterns of behavior

553
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,719
that you want them to do,
so then the people out there

554
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,270
they have their leadership
demonstrating the behaviors

555
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,440
and they see their peers
also doing it as well,

556
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,470
and it makes it much, much
easier for them to do that.

557
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,690
Now we've kind of touched
on this a few times already,

558
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,230
but have entertaining
material that holds attention.

559
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,250
We have all been in those meetings,

560
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,560
where we just wanted to throw
ourselves out the window

561
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,879
as opposed to sit there

562
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,210
and listen to this
thing any longer, right?

563
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,940
We're just, we all we wanna
do is leave the meeting.

564
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,010
People feel that way about training too,

565
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,820
if we don't make it relevant

566
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,530
and at least somewhat entertaining,

567
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,340
and that's a big problem for people.

568
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,360
They will tune out and
not hear the message

569
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,020
you're trying to get through.

570
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,470
One of the key things that I know,

571
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,280
is when it comes to teaching people,

572
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,050
when they walk away,
like when you walk away

573
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,919
from this presentation,
you're not gonna remember

574
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,880
every bullet in every slide,
but you are gonna remember

575
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,560
how you felt how, we let
you feel or made you feel

576
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,960
during this and you will associate that

577
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,530
with some of the material that we present.

578
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,230
Remember that people need to walk away

579
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,560
feeling good about things,
so when it comes to this,

580
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,700
phish people along with
your awareness stuff,

581
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,410
if you wannna get them on board.

582
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,210
Make it gamified, and this
can actually be a good thing,

583
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,010
some people are like,
"Oh simulated phishing"

584
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,840
but what you do is you gamify
it and I see people do this

585
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,290
for things as small as parking spots

586
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,270
or maybe a little trophy or
you know, leaderboard stuff.

587
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,290
I've even seen organizations
take different departments

588
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,899
or different branches and
compete against each other

589
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,180
for the lowest click rates
and things like that.

590
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,310
It gets people really into it

591
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,010
and then you wanna review the results,

592
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,510
you wanna look at what's going on,

593
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,990
again measurement is very important here.

594
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,330
And this is where you see,
especially in the phishing side,

595
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,189
if people are falling for
a certain type of phishing

596
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,750
more than others, you may want to adjust

597
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,740
where your training goes.

598
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,220
Like if they're falling for, you know,

599
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,970
the ones that have you click on links

600
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,020
that are related to food
perhaps, you wanna make sure

601
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,230
that they understand this
and they're better able

602
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,490
to pick those things out.

603
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,410
So look for those trends,

604
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,720
look for the areas that need improvement

605
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,470
or ones you wanna emphasize.

606
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,573
And a lot of this is honestly
just marketing stuff.

607
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,250
- Yeah that's right, actually
to touch upon a point,

608
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,470
the only reason even now
when I work from home,

609
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,270
even if I'm popping out to
just get a glass of water,

610
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,100
I will lock my screen,
and the reason for that

611
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,600
is in one of my first
jobs, we were really young,

612
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,463
and it was a classic, if you
didn't lock your workstation

613
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:09,450
when you walked away,

614
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,937
you'd get an email sent to
the entire department saying,

615
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,669
"I'm buying lunch for everyone today"

616
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,100
or something like that, so you
know, it was just a fun game,

617
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,040
it was harmless, no one
really took offense to it,

618
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,940
but it just drilled into everyone,

619
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,600
like Alt + Control + Delete, boom,

620
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,433
you know, before you step away from there.

621
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,770
But yeah, so coming back onto track,

622
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,230
this is a busy slide and you
can ask us in there in the chat

623
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,030
about this if you wanna go into details,

624
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,440
but this is just saying an example,

625
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,160
this is what like a marketing
campaign typically looks like

626
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
and if you apply to security awareness,

627
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,880
you have ongoing phishing
going along the top

628
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,090
and then you have all the
different channels that support it

629
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,620
so your executives will
say the same message,

630
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,879
your learning management
system will have those modules,

631
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,300
your newsletters, your digital
signage, your screen savers,

632
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,290
the gifts that you give
out or the branded items,

633
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,670
everything will reinforce the same message

634
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,293
that you want change for
that particular campaign.

635
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,637
I really like this Bruce Lee quote,

636
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:13,206
"I fear not the man who has
practiced 10,000 kicks once,

637
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:17,170
"but I fear the man who
practiced one kick 10,000 times."

638
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,040
So, just like any marketing
thing, is repetition

639
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,750
it's the mother of all learning

640
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,410
and the more you repeat
something to your audience,

641
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,460
the more likely they are to remember it.

642
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,090
If you ever been whitewater
rafting or anything,

643
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,659
they will say like you know,
if you fall into the water,

644
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,200
you know, push with your legs,

645
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,750
look for the raft, grab
the hand, you know.

646
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,360
They drill it into you, time
and time and time again,

647
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,082
until it becomes second nature.

648
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,800
Yeah, you know, as we've been in security,

649
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,986
a lot of us have probably
heard the thing saying,

650
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,540
"We can't train people, we
just can't train people."

651
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,860
And that's something that, you know,

652
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,100
it's a soapbox issue for me.

653
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,090
Again I've been dealing
with the human factor

654
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,830
for quite some time, I'll tell you this,

655
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,780
we can train people, if you follow

656
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,050
a couple of different things,
this is just an example.

657
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,419
This is four million people
that they they tracked

658
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,930
over the course of the year.

659
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,450
Initial click rates on phishing
was 38%, which is huge,

660
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,900
that's a big problem.

661
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,690
90 days later, just three
months later down about 14%

662
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,990
and at the end of a year down to 5%.

663
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,760
Don't expect perfection,
there will be some clicks

664
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,650
that are gonna happen,
there will be some errors

665
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,450
that are going to be made,
the idea is to train them

666
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,520
when they do have those issues,

667
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,170
and have them learn from those as well,

668
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,700
so don't expect perfection
but it can be done

669
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,990
and it's a very powerful thing
if we get it relevant to them

670
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,880
and we get them interested in it.

671
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,853
So Javad how about some takeaways here.

672
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,810
- So these are things that we split out

673
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,110
into immediate, midterm and long-term.

674
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,889
These are just some examples,
but my personal favorite

675
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,390
is in the midterm here where
we work with other departments.

676
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,240
You can't do everything by yourself,

677
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,070
but HR and marketing
teams are designed to,

678
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,560
they're experts in
communicating with your staff,

679
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,350
with your audience so they leverage them,

680
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,500
leverage all the resources
you have around you.

681
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,210
- Yep, absolutely I agree 100%, you know,

682
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,150
get with the people that
are trained to do that.

683
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,680
So that being said, we're
gonna be in chat here,

684
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,160
I'm happy to answer any questions

685
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,320
that you have in there as well
and here's our information

686
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,889
if you wanna get back to us afterwards,

687
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,960
we are happy to answer any
questions there as well,

688
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
but I know we're just about out of time.

689
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,693
So you got any parting words Javad?

690
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,740
- So thank you very much,

691
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,720
send them to Eric, any praise

692
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,250
thank you so much for joining us,

693
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,350
