between myself, I'm Rob Roe,

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,700
the Managing Director for
OneTrust Ranger Pacific.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,400
Jason, do you wanna introduce yourself?

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,519
- Sure, my name is Jason Lau.

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,310
I am the Chief Information
Security Officer

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,940
at Crypto.com which is
a FinTech organization

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,160
amongst other things

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,810
and I'm pleased to be here
with Rob today to talk to you

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,523
about privacy and security in the region.

21
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,119
- Thanks Jason, let's go to the agenda.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,953
We're gonna talk about

23
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,540
there's a couple of slides

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,480
on regulation being
the New Growth Industry

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,100
and then I'm gonna interview Jason

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,350
as we go through streamlining data privacy

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,383
and what they've done around
implementing ISO 27701.

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,840
Jason is in the trenches

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,410
having to make this happen all the time.

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,990
And then I'll come back and talk

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,770
a bit about a guide to getting you

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,000
to certification on 27701.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,462
So starting off with the growth industry,

34
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:58,320
we've got lot across Asia,
actually across the globe,

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,279
but here in Asia,

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
we got all those different
privacy standards.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,650
We've put PDPA up there but it's

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,070
PDPA Thailand, PDPA
Philippines, PDPA Indonesia

39
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,690
we're saying PDPA in India.

40
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,060
And what we're also seeing

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,430
is a list of some of these requirements is

42
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,190
we're actually seeing changes to that.

43
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,880
Singapore actually going
out to consultation now,

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,190
Indonesia is about to pass a few laws,

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,900
Japan just added a new
and extra round consent

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,560
and we're gonna see
some more action there.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,193
India's going through the
release of their PDPA,

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,650
New Zealand government is

49
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,083
at the final stages of their privacy act.

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,237
So we're sitting here with
massive change going on

51
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:49,390
all across Asia in the midst of a pandemic

52
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,222
and everything else.

53
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:54,090
So, what else could go wrong here in 2020?

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,950
So with all of that and, you know,

55
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,820
we got to worry about ISO
27001, NIST for security,

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,930
we're seeing more cyber attacks,

57
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,650
we got a lot happening in this space.

58
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,100
So I think it's great,
Jason that we have here

59
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,210
for you to share us your journey you know

60
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,710
and talk about Crypto,

61
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,574
and what Crypto is doing in this space

62
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,790
because you're right across

63
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,950
some of these challenges right now.

64
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,472
Let me hand over to you.

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,010
- Absolutely, so thanks very much.

66
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,070
So I think,

67
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,510
Rob, what you've done is a great setup

68
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,720
for the presentation today.

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,750
Absolutely there's so many
regulations around the world.

70
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,030
And obviously, many of these
regulations in Asia Pacific

71
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,820
started by looking at the General
Data Protection Regulation

72
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,750
in Europe as the foundation.

73
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,200
Now we're gonna be seeing a lot more

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,519
of these changes in the region for sure.

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
And I think one of the
biggest challenges is

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,480
how do organizations navigate this?

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,739
How do we,

78
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,640
what's the privacy strategy?

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,019
What's the cross border
data transfer strategy?

80
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,270
And, unfortunately it's very difficult to

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,050
have a strategy for each and
every one of the regions.

82
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,470
So what we did in our organization,

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,163
my role is the,

84
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,970
basically the security and
privacy global strategy

85
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,803
and implementation.

86
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:15,140
So, what we did was rather than

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,880
focus into any one particular regulation,

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,017
we decided that we would be using more of

89
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:24,739
an overall privacy
governance type of model.

90
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,030
Now, the benefit of this is

91
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,989
if we were to use some sort of framework,

92
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,290
whether it's NIST or ISO,

93
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,360
this would allow us to

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,580
more readily operationalize privacy.

95
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,130
And then when we go to
the different regions,

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,400
we will be able to pivot

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,030
and then make the
requirements more localized,

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,679
if you want us to put it that way.

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,910
Now the challenge is we
actually started last year

100
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,460
and at that time,

101
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,460
ISO 27701 was actually
not officially out yet.

102
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,750
The NIST privacy framework

103
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,040
only came out through January year.

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,240
So, we kind of had an
idea of what was coming

105
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,560
and one of the key things
to understand is that

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,470
it's really bringing together
security and privacy.

107
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,460
So security is more concerned with

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,210
what we call the CIA
Triad; confidentiality,

109
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,159
integrity and availability.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,240
But privacy for many
organizations is still quite new.

111
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,450
And it's more about upholding the rights

112
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,400
and respecting the rights of individuals

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,289
both internally in your
organization and also externally.

114
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,860
And how do we actually
bring it that all together?

115
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,860
So one of the challenges
that we will actually see is,

116
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,750
one of the requirements
first is having ISO 27001.

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,670
So if you don't have ISO 27001,

118
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,550
you won't be able to
bridge to the new 27701.

119
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,120
I think there's a brief
typo on the line at the top,

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,883
you should be saying 27701.

121
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,479
But One of the key
important aspects of this is

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,320
to have your information
security management system

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,370
in place,

124
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,750
which focuses more on your
policies and procedures

125
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,610
and security controls.

126
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,740
Then after that,

127
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,410
then you can breach that and
take that to the next step

128
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,730
to cover for privacy.

129
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,410
Now, part of.

130
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,660
- Sorry, I have a question.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,800
What's the difference between
security and privacy, right?

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,420
You said, people are new to
this whole privacy space,

133
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,970
how have you found that in Crypto

134
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,510
getting the understanding that

135
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,330
it's not just keeping data secure

136
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,469
you gotta be collecting
the right sort of data

137
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,470
for the right purpose in the first place

138
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,640
for people's privacy.

139
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,150
So how have you gone on that journey

140
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,299
between your slide before this one,

141
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,210
security and privacy?

142
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,349
- Sure, so that's a good question.

143
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,700
So it starts really at the top.

144
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,950
So from a cultural perspective

145
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,650
and also from a management perspective,

146
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,484
we have to tell people that "Look,

147
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,520
we're working towards
this new certification

148
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,370
and part of this is

149
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,430
implementing new controls in place.

150
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,890
And part of that, for example,

151
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,000
is a Privacy Information
Management System.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,540
And a sub-part of that would
be to implement things like a

153
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,290
privacy impact assessment.

154
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,580
So early on in,

155
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,460
so we always say the catchphrase,

156
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,359
rather than kind of bake
it in at the end, sorry,

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,193
bolted on at the end,

158
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,990
we have to bake it at, you
know, the very beginning.

159
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,170
So during the product lifecycle,

160
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,410
so we're very product centric company.

161
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,540
So at the very beginning,

162
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,790
we have to do a privacy impact assessment,

163
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,710
security Impact Assessment
during the design phase,

164
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,960
that's when we actually can decide,

165
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,250
look from a risk-based approach,

166
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,700
are we actually over collecting data?

167
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,530
Should we be collecting this type of data

168
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,799
in the first place?

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,270
So we use standards such
as this ISO standard

170
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,729
to help us to operationalize

171
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,380
what we actually need to achieve.

172
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
- So real privacy by
design stuff up front.

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,660
- That's right, that's
right, right, right up front.

174
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,960
And you can see from
this particular slide.

175
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,030
It's basically how you
actually operationalize

176
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,433
and jump from the old ISO to the new ISO.

177
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,600
- Thanks for that, Jason.

178
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,730
So if I can go back to
this slide here, how long?

179
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,820
How long did it take you

180
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,440
to do the ISO 27001
security standard first?

181
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,420
What were the challenges around that?

182
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,460
- Sure, that took us about,

183
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,820
I would say eight to nine months

184
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,090
but it really depends on the
size of the organization,

185
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,590
the different regions that you operate in

186
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,409
and also the staff that you have on hand.

187
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,870
Something like this is really challenging

188
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,350
if you don't have the
right people to help you

189
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,850
to drive the policies and procedures.

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,530
So having it all in writing is one thing

191
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,880
but actually implementing
the security controls

192
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,900
to actually address the
procedures and policies

193
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,640
and need to be put in place

194
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,740
is often the challenge for many companies.

195
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,199
- So to this audience
that we have here today,

196
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,470
I mean, that'd be very
familiar with ISO 27001

197
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,460
or NIST and stuff like that.

198
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,680
I don't imagine that familiar with 27701,

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,560
the privacy standard
that sits on top of that.

200
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,640
How did you go about introducing that

201
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,003
to Crypto in the first place?

202
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,010
- So part of what we do

203
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,390
is we sit in a very interesting market

204
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,340
where a lot of countries
still haven't regulated

205
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,620
the digital money space or
FinTech Crypto space yet.

206
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,340
So part of doing this,

207
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,820
from the executive perspective

208
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,650
is we wanna build trust with our employees

209
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,590
and also trust with our customers.

210
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,060
Now, how do we build trust?

211
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,699
Well, we build trust from ensuring

212
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,370
that the core pillars
of security and privacy

213
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,430
really are at the forefront of
what we're trying to achieve.

214
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,969
So any product that we build,

215
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,220
anything or service that we provide

216
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,160
security and privacy really
needs to be the cornerstone.

217
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,406
From the security perspective.

218
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,910
It's not just the ISO 27001,

219
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,910
we also have PCI level one
compliance at the highest level.

220
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,550
And from the privacy perspective,

221
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,829
because I'm also the regional lead for

222
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,450
the International Association
of Privacy Professionals

223
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,290
I've always been advocating for privacy

224
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,500
very heavily within the organization.

225
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,950
So when this certification came out,

226
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,450
it was actually a very good stepping stone

227
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,820
to achieve many of the
goals we need to achieve

228
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,340
with the general data
protection regulation as well.

229
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,560
So there's not a direct one to one mapping

230
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,872
with achieving all of the
articles within GDPR and 27701.

231
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,130
But there's a lot of nice overlap

232
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,610
where 27701 can help you to operationalize

233
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,310
some of the goals you want
to achieve within the GDPR.

234
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,570
- And you mentioned before
that the standards actually are

235
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,560
Privacy Information
Management System sort of,

236
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,469
not like, I am complying
with some regulation

237
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,570
or some checklist.

238
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm actually building a

239
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,650
Privacy Information Management System.

240
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,100
- [Jason] That's correct.

241
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,210
- From that, do you want to explain that

242
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,730
to the audience a bit
and how that differs from

243
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,760
the individual regulations.

244
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,760
- So again, it goes back to the
operationalizing of privacy.

245
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,210
So you would first need to make sure

246
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,610
that you have a Privacy Information
Management System scope.

247
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,940
So with all of these ISOs

248
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,775
you can generally decide the scope.

249
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,770
So sometimes they would
just decide that look,

250
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,010
we just wanna do this ISO certification

251
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,350
for a particular department

252
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,150
or a data center or marketing

253
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,340
or customer service.

254
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,930
For us, it was different.

255
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,770
I really look at security and privacy

256
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,500
as a wholistic perspective.

257
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,710
So our scope was really
an enterprise wide scope.

258
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,470
So our audit was really across the board

259
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,150
for all of the departments.

260
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,880
Then once you've got your
pins kind of scope set up.

261
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,400
You need to have management buy in

262
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,910
and set up your privacy policy

263
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,480
and your privacy notice.

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
And then really look at privacy
from a risk perspective.

265
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,890
So when you look at privacy
from a risk perspective,

266
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,220
there are many different
risk management models

267
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,810
in the industry.

268
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,479
You can really choose
whichever type you want.

269
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,750
But one way would be to

270
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,510
understand all of the different assets

271
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,330
that you have in your organization,

272
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,320
then categorize those based on risk

273
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,700
and then what type of
security and privacy controls

274
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,090
do you have around that for example.

275
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,670
The next step would be to

276
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,170
build like we discussed before,

277
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,550
really comprehensive
privacy impact assessments.

278
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,490
Once you've got the
privacy impact assessment,

279
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,350
then you can actually take
that to the different teams

280
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,520
who may not necessarily
know too much about privacy.

281
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,480
But with this checklist,

282
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,140
you'll be able to make it really quick

283
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,490
and simple for them.

284
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,320
So that when they do the QA of any product

285
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,233
or any new project that they start with

286
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,119
they have a systematic process

287
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,804
of going through the checklist.

288
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,730
Am I collecting PII data?

289
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,290
What type of PII data?

290
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,733
Is it sensitive PII data?

291
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,540
Do I really need this PII data?

292
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,317
What are the retention periods?

293
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,710
How long are we gonna keep
it for etcetera, etcetera.

294
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,390
So then there's a lot
of different controls

295
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,090
and security controls
that need to go into place

296
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,280
to actually make sure that we

297
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,859
address those privacy concerns.

298
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,630
Then there's all sorts of things
that you gonna worry about

299
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,320
from controllers and
processing agreements.

300
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,730
These are the things that were not

301
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,070
in the original ISO 27001.

302
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,940
So these new processor
agreements, control agreements,

303
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,880
how to handle these areas
and covering these areas

304
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,053
are very new to many
in the security field.

305
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,209
- And you operate across
different countries,

306
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,860
different jurisdictions.

307
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,380
How has this helped you

308
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,939
with what I put up at the start
with all these regulations,

309
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,720
but also the changes of that?

310
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,338
So what's the kind of value
this has brought to you

311
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:04,170
in the Crypto?

312
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,060
- Sure, so I think really
standardizing is useful.

313
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,260
So using a perfect example
of a privacy notice,

314
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,363
which is customer-facing.

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,187
We started ours based on the GDPR

316
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:25,770
and we obviously use the ISO 27001

317
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,840
when we operationalize it.

318
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,770
If we can customize that and pivot

319
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,340
for the different regions
that we operate in

320
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,810
that it makes things a lot easier.

321
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,410
Same thing for consent policies.

322
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,241
Same thing for our privacy
impact assessments.

323
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:40,110
You could, I mean,

324
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,150
every region if you go
to the local regulator

325
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,420
or their website,

326
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,040
they probably do have a template

327
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,260
or something that they can share with you

328
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,350
in order to actually do your
privacy impact assessment.

329
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,390
But standardizing that across the board

330
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,100
regardless of your region makes
things significantly easier

331
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,713
to manage and to maintain.

332
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:09,361
I can give many more examples,
but yeah, those are two.

333
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
- We're also seeing a challenge around

334
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,990
privacy notices, etcetera

335
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,540
across different platforms, right?

336
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,180
So your website,

337
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,160
your mobile app,

338
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,719
your transaction systems

339
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,373
and all that sort of
stuff and we're saying

340
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,500
that our customers have those challenges.

341
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,100
So moving through that,

342
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,870
you mentioned at the start also

343
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,460
about cross border transfers.

344
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,970
How you're handling that?

345
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,890
You know, we see that

346
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,348
the privacy commission is wanting

347
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:41,709
to use the that IPAC

348
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,790
cross border privacy regulations,

349
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,990
what are you doing?

350
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,223
How it's helping you?

351
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,140
- So this is not really
within the scope of the ISO

352
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,480
but it's still definitely
something that we're working on

353
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,780
and it's an ongoing project
that we're working on

354
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,339
because many, as you mentioned,

355
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,340
many of the local Asia Pacific regulators

356
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,640
are really pushing for this.

357
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,050
It is useful but going
back to the original GDPR,

358
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,599
having binding contracts
between the entities

359
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,830
that we work with

360
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,150
and even within our
own global organization

361
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,930
is a really good way to make sure

362
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,390
that there are contractual
and legal binding agreements

363
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,140
between everybody on
how data is transferred.

364
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,800
I think it's still a little bit early.

365
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,410
We watching it very carefully

366
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,719
on the Asia Pacific side of things.

367
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,720
And it's definitely
useful for open transfers

368
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,209
but I think it's still quite early in the

369
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,410
stage at the moment.

370
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,370
So for us, we're using a lot of,

371
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,243
you know, the more the
GDPR type of guidance.

372
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,160
- Yeah, I can hear that in the language

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,310
that you're talking about.

374
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,127
Also, we're saying it's
shaping up versus some of the

375
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:02,250
I picked off stuff they're trying to do

376
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,290
versus standards like 27701

377
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,210
so that if I can comply
with that within regions,

378
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,490
then I can try to get adequacy.

379
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,560
And we know that at the moment,

380
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,200
the EU hasn't given this,

381
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,530
their tick of approval
under their articles.

382
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,430
So we'll see how that all plays out.

383
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,262
- [Jason] That's right.

384
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:22,062
- With adequacy and stuff like that.

385
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,979
Moving along then to, okay, well,

386
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,730
how do you do this?

387
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,190
And some experiences that
we've found out there

388
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,560
in implementing this
with customers is that,

389
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,260
when we talk to a whole lot of customers,

390
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,810
we find that they rely on this tool

391
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,409
that you may or may not have heard of,

392
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,730
it's a thing called Excel.

393
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,270
And everyone is putting
everything into spreadsheets

394
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,530
and they're using email as
this workflow running around

395
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,879
and all dropped into this document.

396
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,680
And this makes it actually
very hard to be agile.

397
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,110
And then when we look at all
the different environments,

398
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,639
so Jason talked about the
security realm ISO 27001,

399
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,770
we now have the privacy realm,

400
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,560
of course have vendor risk management,

401
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,389
we had risk and compliance.

402
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,640
Which risk right now is,

403
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,560
especially how do we plan
for risk around the pandemic?

404
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,710
And what's the next things
that we'll need to worry about?

405
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,540
And the other thing that
we're finding is that

406
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,750
there's a lot of information
sharing around this.

407
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,430
So, under GDPR that we mentioned,

408
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,670
you actually need to make sure

409
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,293
you have confidentiality,
integrity, availability.

410
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,160
They've added resilience in
that security point as well.

411
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,640
We're seeing in Australia,

412
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,750
we're saying the the financial
sector regulator APRA,

413
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,400
implement a thing called CPS 234.

414
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,283
But so by the end of this month,

415
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,330
the financial Institute's you have to have

416
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,120
a full vendor risk
management process in place

417
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,449
by the way, that's linking into security,

418
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,616
it's linking into privacy,

419
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,470
it's linking into risk and compliance.

420
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,184
So we can say there's this

421
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:04,710
whole connection coming
left, right and center.

422
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,740
And what we see is individual departments

423
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,480
all trying to solve their Rubik's Cube,

424
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,320
where that's concerned purpose;

425
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,560
confidentiality, integrity,
solvency, etcetera, etcetera,

426
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,929
going forward.

427
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,120
And when we're working with customers,

428
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,216
what we try to do is
pull it back out of that,

429
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:25,160
and we say, "Stop thinking
about it from this realm."

430
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,870
At the start of everything,

431
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,350
it's about process.

432
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,560
I mean, we're not buying a system

433
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,210
just because we wanna buy a system,

434
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,930
we're buying it to do something for us.

435
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,200
So we have all these processes,

436
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,645
that customer service

437
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,030
or sales or marketing,
etcetera. that we're doing.

438
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,600
And from those processes,

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,310
we're collecting information.

440
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,280
That information could be personal data,

441
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,997
it could be organizational data.

442
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,940
And we have these sorts of questions,

443
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
do we have consent?

444
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,280
What's our purpose?

445
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,440
Now the point Jason is making,
are we collecting too much?

446
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,710
So concepts like data minimization.

447
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,080
And then we gonna store
that data somewhere.

448
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,220
So we're gonna have
these internal systems,

449
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,300
where are they located?

450
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,280
Are they safe?

451
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,430
Who has access?

452
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,340
By the way,

453
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,429
especially the rapid digitization
we're seeing happening,

454
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,970
that's now going into these
third party systems we're using,

455
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,580
so, cloud based system,
SAS, etcetera, etcetera.

456
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,040
And then, we got to worry
about the vendors themselves.

457
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,810
So we're seeing a lot more companies

458
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,810
now doing assessments out
to COVID-19 assessments.

459
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,930
How solvent are you?

460
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,440
And we have a lot of customers
in the travel industry

461
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,930
have been hit very, very
hard in this whole space.

462
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,070
So what we're seeing is
data flowing from the top

463
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,750
from the processes.

464
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,760
We're collecting it all the way down

465
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
through our internal and
our third party systems

466
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,649
and their vendors.

467
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,850
And of course, you gonna
have fourth party systems.

468
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,320
So what are your vendors relying on?

469
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,300
And how do we go through that?

470
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,090
And this becomes a challenge of

471
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,340
trying to pull all of this
together in the space.

472
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,840
So I think

473
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,683
one of the reasons why,

474
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,669
it was great to have Jason talk
about his journey at Crypto

475
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,670
and using a Privacy
Information Management System

476
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,630
like ISO 27701,

477
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,630
which covers ISO 27001 is
recovering all these spaces.

478
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,270
And the way that we look at this

479
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,550
is we kind of remember

480
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,360
those Rubik's Cubes I showed you before.

481
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,870
We kind of think of it as like

482
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,493
this Rubik's cube that looks like this.

483
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,250
And I think thing that
could possibly work.

484
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,050
But if we could have this
multifaceted Rubik's Cube

485
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,230
because we now have all this knowledge

486
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,250
about what's going on
inside our organization.

487
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,010
And in that, what we can
do is we can point to,

488
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,900
well, I wanna look at this
from a privacy perspective.

489
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,020
I wanna look at this from
a security perspective,

490
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,220
from a GRC,

491
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,220
or from a vendor management perspective.

492
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,127
And this is how we work
with a lot of customers.

493
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:14,159
And we're doing a lot
of work around the 27701

494
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,700
on top of 27001 because it's about

495
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,453
what you talked about before Jason is,

496
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,490
working with the business,

497
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,120
working with the organization,

498
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,189
understanding what data are we collecting?

499
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,730
Are we collecting for
all the right reasons?

500
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,680
Where are we storing it?

501
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,210
What controls?

502
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,043
What risks?

503
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:36,989
What threats vulnerabilities
do we have in that place?

504
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,790
And as I showed you before

505
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,980
with those lines going everywhere,

506
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,120
we need to understand

507
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,159
how all these different
things are connected.

508
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,660
Now, I think that's part
of the challenge Jason,

509
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,780
that you've got to face and

510
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,450
when you come out the other end.

511
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,298
Would you like to comment on that?

512
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,131
- Yeah, absolutely.

513
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:57,280
So all of the things that
you've got on the screen now

514
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,580
from customer service,
delivery, product management,

515
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,629
sales, marketing, HR, all of it plus more

516
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,040
were things that we had to work on.

517
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,149
So it really starts with a
management commitment first.

518
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,370
if you don't have the management buy in

519
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,068
then it's very difficult to drive this

520
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,070
throughout your organization

521
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,510
because basically what's happening is that

522
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,797
your policies and procedures
really needs to be aligned

523
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:25,070
company wide and everybody
needs to really put in

524
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,710
the privacy Impact Assessments

525
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,090
throughout the project life cycles,

526
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,483
regardless of what the cycle they're in.

527
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,790
- Cool, so Jason,

528
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,030
I think one of your claims to fame

529
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,480
is your ISO 27701 certified.

530
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,910
You think you're one of the first here

531
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,743
in the Asian region, is that right?

532
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,320
- Yes, so, for a company in our scope,

533
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,570
specifically for our industry,

534
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,080
we are the first for the
FinTech Blockchain Crypto space

535
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,450
for the old ISO plus this
new ISO plus PCI level one.

536
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,710
We are definitely the first

537
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,890
and also in Asia Pacific alongside,

538
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,900
I believe you guys and some
others like Microsoft, etcetera.

539
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,750
I think there's only a handful

540
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,190
that actually have this
certification right now.

541
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,350
And the word on the street is that

542
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,699
there's been some companies

543
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,690
that have really tried,

544
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,800
but they put brakes on it
because they realized that

545
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,649
they actually have to really kind of

546
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,590
put this as a strategic initiative

547
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,970
in order to kind of roll it out.

548
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,650
- Yeah, so Alex Lee,

549
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,790
your counterpart at Microsoft
was a big push for the 27701.

550
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,879
They've done a lot of work,

551
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,640
they've offered some free tools as well,

552
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,920
in their space to help you out.

553
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,490
And I think the point you make there

554
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,580
is really important.

555
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,689
You know, one of our large
banking customers said to us,

556
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,090
you know, the privacy teams
kind of pushing discipline

557
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,919
into the rest of the organization.

558
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,273
And I think as I start to
go through this process,

559
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:59,050
they start to understand,

560
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,200
they don't actually understand

561
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
what they're doing as much
as they should be, right?

562
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,207
In the third party in the vendors,

563
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,320
one implementation we did,

564
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,889
they didn't even know where
their third party is like,

565
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,930
they didn't keep a record
of where they were located,

566
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,860
which is kind of important

567
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,540
in a whole lot of aspects

568
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,800
that we don't need to go through.

569
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,490
As you mentioned Jason,

570
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,920
OneTrust is ISO 27701 certified.

571
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,990
With our experience of that,

572
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,090
we're happy to share that
with anyone out there.

573
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,399
We've also produced this white paper.

574
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,330
So reach out to our website, or to myself,

575
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,379
my emails are roe@onetrust.com

576
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,620
and we can provide this white paper

577
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,708
to help you get started in that.

578
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:50,100
And, you know, we produce all this work.

579
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,040
The other thing that Jason
talked about was the fact that

580
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,040
there's a lot of people using
GDPR as the basis, right?

581
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,290
So what we've also produced here is

582
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,990
through our Data Guidance
which is a regulatory legal

583
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,820
knowledge database that
you can have access to

584
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,870
is we're starting to compare
all the different sort of

585
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,429
regulations across the
region against GDPR.

586
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,040
And we've produced these
booklets that you can download,

587
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,940
where you can say,

588
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,270
the first one there is
the Australian Privacy Act

589
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,853
and privacy principles versus GDPR.

590
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,310
We're saying if you want Brazil,

591
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,669
we got China, we've got Japan,

592
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,650
we've got India CCPA, Thailand, etcetera.

593
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,590
And we're doing more in
terms of that comparison

594
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:46,360
between the GDPR and these regulations.

595
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,070
And on the platform, by the way,

596
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,639
you can actually go in and select

597
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,500
which ones do you wanna compare,

598
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,050
and we drill down with
our network of 500 lawyers

599
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,879
around the world.

600
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,110
We drill down to say
here's where they compare,

601
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,439
here's where they differ and
show that evidence as well.

602
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,440
So, ISO 27701 but also
comparison against the GDPR.

603
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,390
So, what we'd like to encourage you to do

604
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,143
is apply what we've been sharing here.

605
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,480
Jason is very,

606
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,059
you can see him out there
on the speaker circuit,

607
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,430
chair of the IAPP,

608
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,500
the International Association
of Privacy Professionals.

609
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,280
Jason and I've been on
panel before together.

610
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,490
And so a great source of
knowledge there to hear

611
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,980
about what's going on.

612
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,813
He's got more certifications

613
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:39,750
than I ever knew were possible.

614
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,750
Have a look at the ISO
27701 program out there,

615
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,149
reach out to us, we can
talk to you about that,

616
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,270
help you do that and
build this overarching.

617
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,889
So this privacy implementation
management system,

618
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,723
which then,

619
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:58,780
think of that multifaceted
Rubik's Cube all the time

620
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,090
and then think about,

621
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,929
we can then drop that
into all the different

622
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,750
regulatory frameworks as we go on.

623
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,670
So with that,

624
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,240
we're nearly out of time.

625
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,003
But really like to thank you
for participating in this,

626
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,500
like to thank Jason again,

627
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,333
thanks for the help,

628
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,201
always good to talk to you.

629
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,860
And folks,

630
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,760
were here if you ever
need any of the help.

631
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,270
Thank you very much.

632
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,770
- [Jason] Thank you very much.
