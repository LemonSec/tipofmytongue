00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,607
- Hello, and welcome to "Taking Control

2
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,900
"of Cyber Supply Chain Security".

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,009
If you're joining us
live, our speakers are

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,210
in the Slido chat
discussion area right now

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,680
answering questions.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,756
They're also hosting a fabulous

7
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,260
"Supply Chain, "Capture The Flag",

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,550
directly after this presentation.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,050
If you have any audio or video issues,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,490
click the technical support button below.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,500
I'd now like to turn it over to Beau Woods

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,863
and Dr. Allan Friedman
for the presentation.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,280
- Thank you very much, Britta.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm Beau Woods with I Am The Cavalry.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,830
- [Allan] And I'm Allan
Friedman from NTIA.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,200
- Hey Allan, get a load of this.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,170
What do you think that is?

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,170
- That looks like a prop
from a "Star Trek" knockoff

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,110
from the 1950s.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,583
So maybe it's a death ray?

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,550
- Oh, you're very close.

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,500
It's actually a life ray.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,110
This is an MRI that hospitals use

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,440
to get an inside view into a patient

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,090
and find out what's hurting them.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,790
If you're a defender at a hospital,

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,170
how do you think you would figure out

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,003
what vulnerabilities might
exist in this type of device?

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,650
- Maybe I'd hire a hacker like you

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,170
just to try to pen test it,

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,030
see what they can find.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,290
- Well, that's a good thought.

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,620
Having worked in healthcare, though,

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,690
I can tell you, these types of
things don't respond so well

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,429
to penetration tests or
vulnerability assessments.

36
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,210
Sometimes they can fall
over or stop working,

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,699
give bad results.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,770
So, what if, like an MRI machine,

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,339
you could peer into the device

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,450
and see what software it's running?

41
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,953
- [Allan] That'd be pretty useful.

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,830
Do we need special equipment for that?

43
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,103
- You might need special equipment.

44
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,720
On a quick internet search,

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,860
one of the things you can see

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,670
running in some of these devices,

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,000
MRI devices and other hospital equipment,

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,080
is something made by this company.

49
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,919
Now, do you recognize this company?

50
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,716
- [Allan] I don't know
that organization, no.

51
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,240
- Well, they look pretty trustworthy.

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,760
They say they make medical devices.

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,739
And when it matters,
it runs on Wind River.

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,550
Will it help if I gave you this overlay?

55
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,460
- Now, that is something
that's familiar to me.

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,970
That's a real-time
operating system, right?

57
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,090
- That is a real-time operating system.

58
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,250
And what do you know about vulnerabilities

59
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,280
in this real-time operating system

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,830
that may also exist in the
medical device we just showed?

61
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,120
- I seem to recall, last summer,

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,070
that there was a whole bunch of attention

63
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,670
paid to this particular product.

64
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,790
- That's right.

65
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,390
The Urgent/11 set of vulnerabilities

66
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,179
that, with a few internet packets,

67
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,540
an adversary could completely take over

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,283
a device running on VxWorks,

69
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,329
running that operating system.

70
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,460
All right, if you like that game,

71
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,260
let's play a slightly different one.

72
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,420
Do you recognize this?

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,309
- Well, it's been a really long time

74
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,430
since I was in a plane, unfortunately.

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,393
But that looks like a really big plane.

76
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,230
- It does look like a really big plane.

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,899
In fact, it's an Airbus A380,

78
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,440
one of Airbus's signature airplanes

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
that flies in dozens of
fleets around the world.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
Now, what do you think
we can tell about this

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,880
if we examine its underlying software?

82
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,760
- Well, I think, like the medical device,

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,620
we probably don't wanna try to hack it,

84
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,653
especially while we're on the plane.

85
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,813
- Oh, that's right.

86
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,570
You definitely don't wanna hack
it when you're on the plane,

87
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,019
or even tweet that you're gonna hack it

88
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,800
when you're on the plane.

89
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,890
But we can do something similar.

90
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,940
So as you see here on
the Green Hills website,

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,840
they feature the Airbus 380

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,090
as one of the technologies
that their software is in.

93
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,840
So, what do you think we might know

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,720
about Green Hills software and
what vulnerabilities it has

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,160
that are then in the Airbus 380?

96
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,760
- Well, I'm sure since
it's probably different

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,910
than the vulnerabilities
in VxWorks, right?

98
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,380
- You would assume that, but actually,

99
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,359
it also has the Urgent/11 vulnerabilities,

100
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,200
the Green Hills Software has
Urgent/11 vulnerabilities.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,570
Surprising, shocking even, you may say.

102
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,000
Why is that?

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Well, Allan, have you
heard of this company?

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,270
- I don't know, sort of sounds like

105
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,633
a generic mid-aughts tech company.

106
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,620
- Yeah, you would be right.

107
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,810
This company, called Interpeak,
stood up in the early 2000s

108
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,270
and was purchased by VxWorks in 2006.

109
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,590
Before it was bought by VxWorks,
it licensed its technology,

110
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,280
its IP stack, called IPNet,

111
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,179
to all of these different companies,

112
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,890
including Green Hills Software.

113
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,479
So this is how you get
Urgent/11 vulnerabilities

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,240
persistent throughout the supply chain.

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,940
It's why a software package by one company

116
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,890
that was used in a software
package by another company

117
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,099
rolled into a software package

118
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,010
that was eventually
deployed on an airplane

119
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,300
and a medical device can pervade

120
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,330
all of these different systems,

121
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,503
and impact everything that's downstream.

122
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,429
- And that's what we
wanna talk about today,

123
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,270
is this notion of a software supply chain.

124
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,740
The software that you're using

125
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,020
is built on more software
built on more software.

126
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,073
And that's great,

127
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,880
and it helps us get better software

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,350
and more efficient development,

129
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,330
but the risks that we're
facing are growing,

130
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,320
and the supply chains are getting longer,

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,700
and in fact, sometimes more
opaque, rather than less opaque.

132
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,969
So we wanna introduce to you the idea

133
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,030
of a software bill of materials

134
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,950
as a new and emerging tool

135
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,820
that can help you understand the risks

136
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,740
in your software supply chain.

137
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,070
We're gonna tell you that they are coming

138
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,030
and that you can help be a part of shaping

139
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,609
what it looks like for your organization,

140
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,633
your industry, your sector.

141
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,240
- So what do we mean when we talk about

142
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,850
supply chain, exactly?

143
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,740
Well, this is a late model car.

144
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,573
It's pretty nice car.
- [Allan] It's a lot nicer

145
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:14,150
car than I can afford
on a government salary,

146
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll tell you that much.

147
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,289
- It's a lot nicer than I can afford

148
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,490
on a private sector salary too.

149
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,700
But some people can afford it.

150
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,590
And if we could, then we would

151
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,489
be able to see all the different parts

152
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,440
and components of this car

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,200
that are made by third parties.

154
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,280
It's part of the extended supply chain

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,289
of this one single vehicle.

156
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,410
Now, a lot of these components or elements

157
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,620
that go into the car have
a software component.

158
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,990
So, if you pick any of these out,

159
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,033
the smart opener, the mechanical pump,

160
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,560
the front and rear seat belts, even,

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,640
a lot of these components

162
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,219
have software elements as a part of them.

163
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,820
Probably the most familiar one

164
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,240
that most of us think about in cars

165
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,530
is the infotainment unit.

166
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,099
The thing that sits right up front

167
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,690
and that now has an app store

168
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,073
and WiFi with 5G
connectivity connected to it.

169
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,130
But what does that look like

170
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,120
when you look all the way
down the supply chain,

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
when we think about all
of the different elements

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,320
and the potential vulnerabilities?

173
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,830
Well, that supply chain
can be pretty deep,

174
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,000
and can also be pretty opaque.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
It can go to many different
levels and layers,

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,330
as we saw with Interpeak
and the IPNet software,

177
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,539
it can go way down the rabbit hole,

178
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,860
it can also be, as we saw with Interpeak,

179
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,160
if you were involved in looking

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,410
for some of those
Urgent/11 vulnerabilities,

181
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,760
it's hard to know where those
vulnerabilities existed,

182
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,530
'cause it's hard to see
which package had them.

183
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,380
Any package that has a vulnerability

184
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,200
tends to pass that vulnerability

185
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,060
down the supply chain
to the ultimate product

186
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,680
that you might buy and
put it in your environment

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
to operate or that you might sell

188
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,133
to your customers to operate.

189
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,460
While it can be overwhelming,

190
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,940
we wanna give you a very simple framework

191
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,880
to understand some of
these supply chain risks.

192
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,180
So, starting at the top, you
have supplier-facilitated risk.

193
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,890
Now this might be what
you typically think of

194
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,253
as third party supplier risk.

195
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,460
The people who are helping
you design your website,

196
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,710
who are coming into clean after hours

197
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,390
and have access to your physical premises,

198
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,260
the folks who have access
to your HVAC equipment,

199
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,340
so that they can maintain it over time,

200
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,439
this is what we mean by
supplier-facilitated risk.

201
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,150
- And Beau, there are
actually two great talks

202
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,770
at AJP this year devoted to thinking about

203
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,250
assessment and risk from
third party software

204
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,820
and third party service providers.

205
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,450
- That's great.

206
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,870
The next type of risk we wanna talk about

207
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,790
is counterfeit risk.

208
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,790
Now, this is particularly
harmful in hardware components,

209
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,860
but it can also apply to
software components as well.

210
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,420
So, hardware has firmware on it,

211
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,120
sometimes with the hardware,
you'll have remarked chips

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,900
that didn't pass inspection the first try,

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,939
so they might remark
them as if they passed,

214
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,920
or they might take substandard components,

215
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,709
mark them as higher grade,

216
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,300
and then sell them on a gray market.

217
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,020
Or you might have software

218
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,829
that comes bundled with
some of the packages,

219
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,250
some of the things that you
get, that is unlicensed,

220
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,000
which may mean it doesn't
get security updates,

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,240
or it may mean that there's
some inferior capabilities in it

222
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
or security issues that had to

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,620
go into developing the brakes

224
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,950
that allowed people to get
around the licensing regime,

225
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,740
or it could come with backdoors,

226
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,180
Trojan horses deliberately
implanted in the software

227
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,800
that gets carried into the final product.

228
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,782
We also wanna talk about or
think about malicious taint.

229
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,829
Now, this is what you might think of

230
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,160
when you think of an
intentional subversion,

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,209
often by a nation state

232
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,330
of the technology that you're buying.

233
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,110
But in those cases, it
tends to be very expensive.

234
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,740
And the adversary has to
have a privileged position

235
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,290
within the supply chain

236
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,020
in order to make these types
of security risks manifest.

237
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,199
So it can be, you know,
six figures in six months

238
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,170
to get an implant in a device,

239
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,360
which, for most organizations,

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,210
probably isn't worth
worrying too much about.

241
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,510
For other organizations it is.

242
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,170
And several organizations spend
millions of dollars a year

243
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,120
trying to look for this
type of malicious taint.

244
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,990
The last type we wanna talk about,

245
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,923
covered in this framework,
is called unintended taint.

246
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,590
You might know this as known
but unmitigated vulnerabilities

247
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,540
in supply development,
deployment configuration.

248
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,959
These are things that typically

249
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,600
we only treat at the operational layer.

250
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,520
But if we look at them
through a supply chain lens,

251
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,819
we actually have a lot more
tools that we can use to pull on

252
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,690
in order to decrease costs

253
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,090
and optimize risk for your organization.

254
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,898
So we're gonna examine
those through this talk,

255
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,200
and how you can understand those better

256
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
and how you can treat those.

257
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,360
- So, what can we do about this?

258
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,430
One of the challenges of
thinking about supply chain risk

259
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,310
is supply chain isn't some magical slot

260
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,020
that most organizations have,

261
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,400
it actually touches on different roles

262
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,620
that we all wear, different
hats that we all wear,

263
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,640
inside an organization.

264
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,650
And so, we're gonna share
three different perspectives

265
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,930
of thinking about supply chain risks.

266
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,280
First, a lot of us make software.

267
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,459
And there, the concern,
as Beau was talking about,

268
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,820
is worrying about vulnerabilities
in our components.

269
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,080
So, am I delivering
something to my customer

270
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,460
if I make software that is
actually vulnerable today?

271
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,420
So I need to have some
visibility into my supply chain.

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,589
But this is also
something that can be seen

273
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,460
as just part of good production,

274
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,780
part of a standard proper supply chain.

275
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,510
The same way that, if I make a car,

276
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,650
I wanna pay attention to the
components that I'm shipping.

277
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,720
Similarly, if I'm making software,

278
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,500
I wanna know what's in there.

279
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,510
This allows me to better
manage my codebase,

280
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,050
execute allowed policies
or excluded policies

281
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,510
and similarly pass along
that information downstream.

282
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,930
The other area in supply chain
is how we choose software.

283
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,839
Maybe we're buying commercial software,

284
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,130
maybe we're selecting a
key open source component

285
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,600
to fulfill a role in our organization.

286
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,010
One of the first questions
we should be asking is,

287
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,420
are there known vulnerabilities?

288
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,079
Out of the box, is this
gonna put my organization

289
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
potentially at risk?

290
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,870
This, in turn, can allow me to do

291
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,830
a more targeted security analysis,

292
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,000
it can help me understand
software integration,

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,500
and also it's a way of
thinking about the maturity

294
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,520
of the organization that
I'm either buying from

295
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,900
or selecting from.

296
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,980
And of course, almost all of us

297
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,090
are operating some
software on our networks

298
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,220
or in our cloud environments.

299
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,383
And there, we have a very
simple, straightforward question.

300
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,280
Is there a risk today,
and more importantly,

301
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,439
in the future when we discover

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,450
one of these issues that
Beau was just talking about?

303
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,040
Can we quickly and easily
determine are we affected?

304
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,969
And if we are affected, maybe
there's a patch available,

305
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,230
that's great.

306
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,720
If there isn't a patch available yet,

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,070
knowing about it can actually help us

308
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,010
take all their mitigations,

309
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,120
we can tune our intrusion
detection system,

310
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,630
we can segment our network,

311
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,720
we can work with our threat
intelligence provider

312
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
to help us understand what risks

313
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
might be targeting us personally.

314
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,800
All three of these roles are critical.

315
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,849
and they all depend on one key thing

316
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,870
that we need in our software supply chain,

317
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,840
which is transparency.

318
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,630
How do we get transparency?

319
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,430
We get transparency through this idea

320
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,770
of a software bill of materials.

321
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,699
So, what is software bill of materials?

322
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,490
Well, one way to think about it

323
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,303
is it's an ingredient label.

324
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,950
Some of you know that
when you go to the store,

325
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,800
there are notices about allergens.

326
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,709
There are lots of people
who are allergic to nuts,

327
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,447
so the package of my piece
of candies might say,

328
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:17,960
"May contain nuts."

329
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,397
Wouldn't it be nice if
my software told me,

330
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:24,920
"Hey, you know what? It
may contain struts."?

331
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,020
So, when I say SBOM,
what does it look like?

332
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,790
Well, it's not that complicated.

333
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,420
One way to think about
it is a dependency graph,

334
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,650
this is the piece of software I'm using.

335
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,670
Here's a toy example, say,
company called Cloud Pets,

336
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,520
which turns out, in their supply chain,

337
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,110
they were using a database that,

338
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,340
if anyone had looked, they
would have seen had no security,

339
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,980
even though it had data
from kids and families.

340
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,485
But in this case, we're
not gonna look at this,

341
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,701
we're gonna look at the toy example,

342
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,790
we're gonna say no,
listen, in Acme Appliance

343
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,750
is built on two components,
Bingo Buffer and Bob's Browser.

344
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,420
Bob's Browser, in turn, contains
Carol's Compression Engine.

345
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,199
The other thing to notice about this

346
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,123
is this allows us to see
what data we don't know.

347
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,650
So for example, we know that
Carol's Compression Engine

348
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,699
doesn't have any further
components, that's fine.

349
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,610
We don't need to worry about
that, we just watch that.

350
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,180
Bingo Buffer, depending
on my risk tolerance,

351
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,640
maybe I wanna know what's inside it.

352
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,140
We're just being able to document

353
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,300
just what's the software component,

354
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,650
so that we can make the
appropriate risk-based decision.

355
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,513
Just a graph.

356
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,173
So, how deep do we want this data?

357
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,780
To think about the basics,

358
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,060
we want at least all of
the top level includes,

359
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,760
all of the software that
you're directly calling.

360
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,630
And the vision that the community
is slowly coming up with

361
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,860
is to saying, we want to use
recursion to get us down there.

362
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,940
So, have your top level includes

363
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,180
and ask for their includes,

364
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,099
and then we'll be able to
make a best faith effort

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,930
to actually have some visibility.

366
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,593
Now, when I say we, what do I mean?

367
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,000
There's an ongoing global
cross sector effort

368
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,820
that's trying to establish
some of the basic norms

369
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,970
and practices around this.

370
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,770
The scope is really the
entire supply chain.

371
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,300
Starting with the open source community,

372
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,740
we've got folks in the Linux Foundation,

373
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,840
the Apache Foundation, Oasis involved,

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,320
through middleware, commercial software,

375
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,740
embedded in IoT, and of course,

376
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,880
perhaps most important, customers,

377
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,910
people using software today
who need this information.

378
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,120
We're also making sure that
the scope is cross sector.

379
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,640
We don't wanna have separate solutions

380
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,330
for different types of companies,

381
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,810
because we all use the same software.

382
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,599
Because we have such a broad scope,

383
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,380
we're trying to frame it quite narrowly.

384
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,210
We're just looking at software.

385
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,320
There's a lot of other
information we may want.

386
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,200
The vision is they're integrated
into those other efforts.

387
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,763
We're just focusing on
the software dependencies.

388
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,270
So, why would we wanna do this?

389
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,860
Why should we SBOM?

390
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,470
Well, I've talked about some
of the different perspectives,

391
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,120
but let's look about how
this can help the community.

392
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,839
We talk about one of
the magical properties

393
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,780
in cybersecurity of resiliency,

394
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,990
and SBOM is a great example
where it can give us resiliency.

395
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,319
If we discover a flaw way
up my supply chain today,

396
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,250
I may not learn about it
until it percolates down.

397
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,490
Someone has to patch, that
patch has to get rolled in,

398
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,869
that patch has to get rolled in,

399
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,119
it could take quite some
time before I know about it.

400
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,419
There's nothing magical about

401
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,330
changing people's speed of patching,

402
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,730
once we have visibility
through transparency,

403
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,810
but with an SBOM, I can take action today

404
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,720
if I believe I'm at risk
through other mitigations

405
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,010
while I'm wasting.

406
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,803
And I can also try to drive that upstream.

407
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,740
But let me ask you a question.

408
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,020
If you have to choose between

409
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,076
two different open source products to use,

410
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,960
or two open source libraries
to use in your product,

411
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,010
one of them has a handful
of vulnerabilities in it,

412
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,420
maybe it's got two CVEs, the
other one, never had a CVE.

413
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,770
Which one are you gonna
put in your product?

414
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,910
- I think, you know, probably the one

415
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,730
that's never had a CVE, right?

416
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,340
- Well, it'd be really nice to think

417
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,629
that never having a CVE
means no vulnerabilities.

418
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,650
But I'd argue it's the exact opposite.

419
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,690
If you have a CVE, that means

420
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,690
it's actually a fairly mature project.

421
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,900
They know how to receive
vulnerability information

422
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,360
from a hacker like you.

423
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,300
They know how to get a CVE number.

424
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,129
And they can put it in
a vulnerability database

425
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,160
so that we all know about
it, they're good citizens.

426
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,330
It could be that the one
that's never had a CVE

427
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,260
has just never had a vulnerability.

428
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,580
Or it could be that it's an organization,

429
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,960
they don't know how to work

430
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,420
with the broader software ecosystem.

431
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,270
Having an SBOM allows us
to have visibility upstream

432
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,379
and actually reward organizations

433
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,720
that are thinking about it.

434
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,090
But maybe you don't care about the,

435
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,929
you know, the bigger ecosystem, right?

436
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,200
You're here to make money
and serve your customers.

437
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,480
Well, it turns out that having visibility

438
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,740
just makes simple financial sense.

439
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,390
The product security director

440
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,510
from a giant company told us

441
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,510
that having visibility could
save them 100,000 man hours.

442
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,073
Why?

443
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,680
Because whenever there's a risk,

444
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,970
they have to work across

445
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,760
all of the different product families

446
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,824
that are all quite siloed today.

447
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:27,330
And then they have to
coordinate with their customers.

448
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,949
Having the visibility and the transparency

449
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,970
could really help.

450
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,310
So, if we're gonna do this,
how are we gonna do it?

451
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,010
We didn't want to create
yet another standard.

452
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,460
That's the last thing folks need

453
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,250
is a new thing to adopt.

454
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,397
We wanted to build on
what's already out there.

455
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,840
And the good news is that there are two,

456
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,159
now two and a half, data formats

457
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,620
that are able to implement SBOM.

458
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,620
SPDX comes out of the Linux Foundation.

459
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,490
It's built for licensing,

460
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,830
but it can be used to capture SBOM data.

461
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,449
And similarly, the SWID tag,
which is an ISO standard,

462
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,310
an international standard,
and the vision here

463
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,840
is also it can capture
this data and share it now.

464
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,649
We're not interested in
saying we have to pick one,

465
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,960
in fact, quite the opposite.

466
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,338
We're going to make sure

467
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,950
that we can translate across them,

468
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,507
we're not gonna pick a winner,

469
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,610
but making sure that we can all use

470
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,939
the same fields that convey the same data.

471
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,870
And you can see that, listen,

472
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,219
we're not looking for too much,

473
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,590
what's the supplier, what's the product,

474
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,990
what's the version, and then a hash,

475
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,860
so we're talking about the same thing.

476
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,949
The last thing I wanna
flag for ongoing work

477
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,500
is some proof of concept
work that's happening,

478
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,100
because it's not just
enough to talk about it,

479
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,959
we need to show that it's valuable.

480
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,180
And over the past year,

481
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,250
some of the biggest hospitals
in the United States

482
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,440
have gotten together

483
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,270
with some of the medical
device manufacturers

484
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,820
that are making popular products to show

485
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,550
that the manufacturers
can generate the data

486
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,080
and the hospitals can
actually integrate this data

487
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,159
into their risk.

488
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,390
And one of the things
that we're really proud of

489
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,940
is in the middle the world's
largest public health crisis,

490
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,600
we have hospitals still
prioritizing this exercise.

491
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,030
It's even being led by the CSO

492
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,420
of New York Presbyterian in New York City,

493
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,030
one of the epicenters of the
current crisis in America.

494
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,639
This has the priorities,
and it's pretty rare.

495
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,320
Hey, Beau, is it common
for the healthcare sector

496
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,143
to be leading in cybersecurity?

497
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,620
- Having worked in the healthcare
sector for three years,

498
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,493
I can tell you no, it's not common.

499
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,159
- So, what are the next
steps in our process?

500
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,240
Right now, as we brought
together this global community,

501
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,010
we're refining and extending the model,

502
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,843
we're trying to tackle

503
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,560
some of the remaining engineering issues,

504
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,983
we wanna integrate this into other areas

505
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,389
that are more focused on high assurance,

506
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,060
such as, say, 5G or transportation,

507
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,600
where we need to know
what's in our software.

508
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,250
We also wanna make this
easier and cheaper for you.

509
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,600
And so, we've got folks from
the open source community

510
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,209
and the security vendor community

511
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,940
collecting tools that can do this today,

512
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,420
and also acknowledging what
are the tools that we need

513
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,560
to make sure that we can
have this working for you.

514
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,340
And we're thinking about
awareness and adoption.

515
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,199
There are more proof of
concept exercises percolating

516
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,300
in different sectors.

517
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,840
If this is interesting
to you, please reach out.

518
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
And ultimately, I think
we're gonna see this

519
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
in some draft contract language.

520
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,953
So you can start keeping
an eye out for this.

521
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,572
- Yeah, and, you know,
just having an SBOM,

522
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,580
or creating one, taking
receipt of one, or using it,

523
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,330
isn't gonna get all of
your software supply chain

524
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,659
issues solved.

525
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,830
So there are a lot of other things.

526
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,879
Many of them are related to SBOM,

527
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,560
many of them can be supported by SBOM

528
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,364
or enabled by SBOm.

529
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,230
What do those look like?

530
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,160
Well, you know, the first one

531
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,070
is pretty straightforward,
software updates.

532
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,090
In the software industry, we've known

533
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,010
and used about those for decades.

534
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,730
Some of the other organizations

535
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,720
and some of the other industries

536
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,710
are not quite as far along.

537
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,220
So, you might be surprised,
but there are still,

538
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,420
today, in 2020, devices and
systems that you can buy

539
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,260
that are not software updatable

540
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
when security issues pop up,

541
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,150
or where some pretty critical components

542
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,810
of those systems are
not software updatable,

543
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,220
you have to replace the
individual component,

544
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,610
or you have to replace the
entire software package,

545
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,723
your entire device.

546
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,500
Asking or getting to understand

547
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,340
the manufacturer's software
supply supported lifetime

548
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,190
will help you understand what
your responsibilities are

549
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,160
and when you might need
to look at replacing it.

550
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,070
So, ask manufacturers, ask vendors,

551
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,899
how long they're gonna
support security updates

552
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,080
at a minimum.

553
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,120
Usually there's an internal development

554
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,449
lifecycle process that they have.

555
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,530
If they can't tell you, that
should be a flag right there

556
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,440
that it may be that they don't know,

557
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,400
or they're not gonna
support it for very long.

558
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,800
At a very minimum,

559
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,980
if you're not informed about

560
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,310
what that support lifetime looks like,

561
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,250
you can't adequately plan for
when you need to replace it,

562
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,130
or how to operate safely and
securely after that date,

563
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,310
or even when you'll need to
start adding more protections

564
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,590
to these devices, so
that you can secure them

565
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,713
if you choose to still operate them.

566
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,230
Secondly, I wanna point out
some model contract language,

567
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,230
model procurement language.

568
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,880
The Edison Electric
Institute and the Mayo Clinic

569
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,470
both have sets of model
procurement language you can use

570
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,390
for supply chain security.

571
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,050
Now, I'm most familiar with
the Mayo Clinic's versions.

572
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,440
And in it, they ask for things

573
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,410
like a software bill of materials,

574
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,960
they ask for things like
supported software lifetimes

575
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,820
and update lifetimes,

576
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,679
they ask about certain
things and certain concepts

577
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,320
that mature manufacturers

578
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,159
will be really easily able to address

579
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,630
and less mature organizations

580
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,460
might have to think a little bit harder.

581
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,170
But essentially, if they can't tell you

582
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,630
some of these components and
some of the security questions

583
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,210
that these procurement
language documents ask

584
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,000
or put into the contract,

585
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,970
then it indicates that
you might have to do

586
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,227
more on your side, increasing
your cost of secure operation.

587
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:15,560
- Another thing that we can do,

588
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,669
once we have visibility
in our supply chain,

589
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,620
is actually monitor that supply chain.

590
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,840
So if you know that you're using

591
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,350
a certain open source component,

592
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,409
you can say, or a certain
commercial component,

593
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,360
you can start to do targeted analysis,

594
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,300
you can loop it into
your threat intelligence.

595
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,790
There are a number of folks in the market,

596
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,210
they're starting to do this more,

597
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,870
which will actually monitor it

598
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,679
to make sure that there isn't
an intentional backdoor,

599
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,280
or that new vulnerabilities
haven't been discovered.

600
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,966
- And one of the things that

601
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,290
we couldn't end this
talk without bringing up,

602
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,149
is the metaphorical elephant in the room

603
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,410
that rarely gets talked about,

604
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,390
the idea of software liability

605
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,150
and the idea of new liability models

606
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,760
that might help
organizations and ecosystems

607
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,010
understand where some
of the trade offs are

608
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,910
in accountabilities and
responsibilities and roles

609
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,600
throughout the supply chain
and chain of operations.

610
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,860
If you don't know who's on the hook

611
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,860
for what type of security
mechanisms or security processes,

612
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,830
then it's hard to know
who has to do something

613
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,580
and it slows down response

614
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,072
once you know something needs to be done.

615
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,750
So what to do next.

616
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,710
All right, imagine that the talk is over.

617
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,190
Don't close the window yet,

618
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,770
but in a few minutes,

619
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,470
after you get done with
the Supply Chain CTF,

620
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,530
close the window, go send out an email

621
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,930
to your procurement officer.

622
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,160
Probably, they're trying to
do the same thing you are.

623
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,460
Increase the quality of things
that your organization gets,

624
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,200
decrease the cost and ensure

625
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,380
that they're able to be
integrated safely and securely.

626
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,220
So help them help you.

627
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,900
Find out what they need

628
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,450
to better help both of you be successful.

629
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,130
Secondly, ask sellers
if they provide SBOMs,

630
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,900
ask sellers if they provide
other security information

631
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,290
that you can look at,

632
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,909
because if they are providing this,

633
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,550
again, it tells you a
little bit of something

634
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,790
about how they secure their organizations.

635
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,413
A major global 100 bank in
the United States, today asks,

636
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,629
and for the past five to seven years,

637
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,153
has been asking for SBOMs.

638
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,419
Not to scrutinize them necessarily,

639
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,800
but in particular, as an indicator

640
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,800
that a certain organization's
maturity level in security

641
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,650
might be insufficient, it tells them

642
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,754
that they're gonna have to
do more on the bank side

643
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,649
to increase security.

644
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,473
So they're gonna ask for
a discount of 10 to 20%.

645
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:55,139
That can be a really valuable
negotiation technique.

646
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,460
Third, consider accountability
and responsibility.

647
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,750
Who does what when and
what happens if they don't?

648
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,910
Having these discussions,

649
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,810
looking in the Mayo Clinic's
procurement language,

650
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,149
you can see how they have decided

651
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,820
to come down on some of these issues.

652
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,210
And you can use that as a roadmap

653
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,351
and a model for yourselves.

654
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:13,720
Next, brainstorm how you're gonna respond

655
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,110
to new vulnerabilities or new
types of supply chain issues.

656
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,959
Run some tabletop exercises,

657
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,837
maybe one where you have no
software bill of materials

658
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,250
and one where you have a
software bill of materials.

659
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,290
See what the difference would be

660
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,168
in your response time and capabilities.

661
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,002
- [Allan] And costs.

662
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,970
- And costs, that's right.

663
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,070
As Allan mentioned earlier,

664
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,290
there's an open dialogue
going on, cross sector,

665
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,710
cross supply chains international.

666
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,620
One of the venues where
you can get involved

667
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,459
is through the NTIA Working Group process,

668
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,510
and they're multi-stakeholder convenings.

669
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,360
So, if you can attend

670
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,699
and pop into these industry led events,

671
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,320
where you join the conversation,

672
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,820
there's a link down to here in the bottom,

673
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,740
ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency.

674
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,670
Go there, find out how
you can get involved

675
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,270
and how you can learn from them.

676
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,750
And finally, we have some
resources that you can look at.

677
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,647
If you want to--

678
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,200
- If you wanna know more
about the broader issue

679
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,980
of software supply chain,

680
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,840
the Atlantic Council has done a great job

681
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,879
of collecting some data,

682
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,760
so that you can see the general trend

683
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,480
and show your management
that this is a growing issue

684
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,890
with real data behind it.

685
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,630
And of course, this is how
to get in touch with me

686
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,623
and learn more about the NTIA effort.

687
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,460
- And with that, we're
done with our presentation.

688
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,283
Thank you very much and stay
tuned for the Supply Chain CTF.

689
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,730
- [Allan] Thanks so much.
