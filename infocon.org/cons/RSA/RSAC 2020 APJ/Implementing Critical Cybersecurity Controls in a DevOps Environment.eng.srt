1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,640
- Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,440
First, just a brief
introduction on myself.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,959
I'm the current vice president
oF ISACA Singapore chapter,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,820
and I've worked in the cyber
security field for the last

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,460
23 years in various responsibilities.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,910
From developing cybersecurity
standards to risk assessment,

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,450
to Incident Management
and awareness training

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,334
and developing multi master plans

9
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:30,270
and running security improvement programs,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,339
in both IT and OT environments.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,450
For the next 30 minutes or
so, my intent is to address

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,140
some of what I believe are
critical cyber security controls

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,410
to be deployed in a DevOps environment.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,870
And also share conundrums that are,

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,410
conundrums that are commonly encountered.

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,220
Last but not least, I hope
to end we have a bit of

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,699
look ahead into what we
can expect from DevOps.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,110
I would love to hear
your thoughts as well.

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,760
Just before I begin,

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
I just want to highlight
the disclaimer you can see

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,629
at the bottom of my slide,

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,789
that the views and opinions
expressed in this presentation,

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,760
are entirely my own and
do not necessarily reflect

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,220
the official position of any organization.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,079
In this COVID-19, and for
some post COVID-19 era.

26
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,339
We are definitely looking at
a new cybersecurity normal.

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,180
Where employees work from home,

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,313
and students have home based learning.

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,230
The cyber footprint has changed,

30
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,840
and there is a such in cloud adoption.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,050
There is also a multi fold increase

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,470
in cyber attacks and threats.

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,039
Whether it is towards
virtual private networks,

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,480
or home broadband routers, or n devices,

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,910
or the cloud itself in
order to capitalize on

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,160
the increased attack surface.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,550
And use them as conduits

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,130
into the corporate enterprise networks.

39
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,539
The old adage that it
is not a matter of if,

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,240
but when incidents will happen is per se.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,990
The new adage is that either
you know you have breached,

42
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,790
or you don't assume breach principle.

43
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,290
How then can we prepare ourselves against

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,489
the inevitability of a breach?

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,630
In the DevOps environment,

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,859
how can we implement
security in the manner

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,290
to better future proof
against such cyber attacks?

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,060
First, I think it is
important that we recognize

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,210
our backyard in DevOps.

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,549
We all know the tightly intertwined

51
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,520
relationship between DevOps and Cloud.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,010
The benefits without doubt for DevOps

53
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,070
is high velocity deployment,

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,420
product improvements and increased trust

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,643
between development and operations teams.

56
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,580
Cloud adoption into DevOps
provide a black box approach.

57
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,500
The complexity of managing
resources can be outsourced

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,223
to the cloud service provider.

59
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,643
With auto provisioning
and de-provisioning,

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,530
we granted the elasticity of the,

61
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,910
granted elasticity of the cloud.

62
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,053
Greater focus can be placed
upon development work.

63
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,161
Most of such development is through

64
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,270
an infrastructure as a service model,

65
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,973
or platform as a service model.

66
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,000
In most cases virtual private
cloud and public cloud

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,700
is adopted more than pure private clouds.

68
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,690
In DevOps, we often use the phrase

69
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,897
"infrastructure as code".

70
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,820
Configuration of servers can
be run as code and deployed.

71
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,430
They can be versioned
at the end and tested.

72
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,350
Such deployment allows consistency,

73
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,200
resulting in configuration assurance.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,989
When there are updates,
such updated configurations

75
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,283
would be applied consistently across.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,210
Such an approach also
eliminates the issue of code

77
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,090
that works fine in staging,
but failing in production.

78
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,280
Simply because the operating environment

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,713
is not truly alike between
staging and production.

80
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,269
Such approaches are
otherwise known as CI/CD

81
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,690
or Continuous Integration
and Continuous Deployment.

82
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,040
There are many tools in this area,

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,700
such as Jenkins and Dockers.

84
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,380
Configuration management

85
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,204
is an indispensable aspect of DevOps.

86
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:28,940
Chef, Puppet, Saltstack,
Ansible, Terraform

87
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,969
are examples of such tools.

88
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,287
Not least, underlying containerization

89
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,049
and Microservices rely on
solutions such as Kubernetes.

90
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,761
After recognizing and
understanding our DevOps backyard,

91
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:46,130
we now explore the key
security concerns with it,

92
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,883
so that we can address them.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,470
On this slide is a list
of some of what I feel,

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,133
are the key concerns
with our DevOps backyard.

95
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,260
If any of you come across
this piece of news recently

96
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,719
regarding the Docker Hub,

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,070
distributing Cryptomining Malware.

98
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,260
Firstly automated deployment
does not come without risk.

99
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,510
Automation has its downsides,

100
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,180
and is the means to repeat
human errors with rigor

101
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,670
in a consistent manner.

102
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,460
Cloud reduces control and visibility

103
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,190
at hardware and network.

104
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,170
In one instance, an
administrator machine compromised

105
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,530
my malware, resulted in
a breach of the systems.

106
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,929
We have also heard of
ransomware or ransom worm,

107
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,703
breaking cloud service providers of late.

108
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,240
While automation helps ensure consistency,

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,650
sometimes faulty spin-ups
may leave a virtual machine

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,902
in an unstable state.

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,500
Which you may not realize
until everything is automated

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,050
in the black box.

113
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,750
Since developer duties are
integrated with operator duties,

114
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,720
there is now a seeming lack
of segregation of duties

115
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,163
between the developers and the operators.

116
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,320
The other concern is
whether we realize that

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,993
developers have adhered to
secure development standards.

118
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,200
Or they're actually cutting
corners to roll out fast

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,953
due to speed to market?

120
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,250
In addition, aligned images
of an on-premise server.

121
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,950
There may be multiple
versions of images kept

122
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,610
with varying security.

123
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,180
But as a resource spinning up one

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,520
that is really inappropriate
security posture,

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,930
say for critical application.

126
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,390
Not least, do you know how
quickly a patch is deployed?

127
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,210
When a security flaw is
found in the cloud image.

128
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,070
How do you keep track?

129
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,420
When meltdown and specter
vulnerability struck,

130
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,930
many of the cloud service
providers scramble to fix it

131
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,050
because such vulnerabilities could result

132
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,760
in a guest escape into the hypervisor.

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,520
Therefore, allowing one
tenant to potentially assess

134
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,609
another tenant's data in the
multi tenant environment.

135
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,800
Was it visible to you how rapidly
the cloud service provider

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,740
had resolved these vulnerabilities?

137
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,010
In the previous slide, I
had provided you a list of

138
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,370
potential cyber security related issues

139
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,640
with the DevOps environment.

140
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,250
How then can we future proof against

141
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,803
cyber attacks and threats?

142
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,730
Mindset is our foremost importance.

143
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,657
We often hear the phrase,

144
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,690
"follow the spirit and not the form".

145
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,950
All too often, employees
who do not believe

146
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,370
will look at the form and
work around the spirit

147
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,220
of the intent so as to fit the form.

148
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,180
This often results in cybersecurity
practices that satisfy

149
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,500
compliance requirements and audits,

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,109
but do not actually address the
risk, where it matters most.

151
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:48,500
Therefore, ahead of everything else.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,510
Having the right cybersecurity
and risk based culture

153
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,750
is of utmost importance.

154
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,800
Bringing DevSecOps into focus,

155
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,980
the premise is that everyone

156
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,460
in the software development life cycle

157
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,604
is responsible for security.

158
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,520
It is not cybersecurity team alone.

159
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,991
It is not the infrastructure team alone.

160
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,400
Finger pointing hinders security.

161
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,729
Where the roles are raci is unclear

162
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,430
in the area of cybersecurity
cracks will form,

163
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,530
allowing intruders to exploit them.

164
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,809
This is also about trying to
automate call security tasks

165
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,030
by embedding security
controls and processes into

166
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,679
the DevOps workflow.

167
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,140
To shift left in the DevOps tool chain,

168
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,010
do everything with a security-by-design,

169
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,159
and privacy-by-design mindset.

170
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,459
There are three important
C's in the DevSecOps culture,

171
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,680
that should be ingrained
and reported upon.

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,680
And that is, collaboration,
communication, and cohesiveness.

173
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,830
This would minimize finger pointing

174
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,330
and having no man's land
in responsibilities.

175
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,290
One of the most time
consuming tasks in any project

176
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,010
is addressing the raci and
conforming responsibilities.

177
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,370
DevOps can only be a job when
these three C's are present.

178
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,320
After setting up the correct mindset,

179
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,620
good governance underscores the ability

180
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,803
to Future-proof against cyber threats.

181
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:23,040
It embodies, six key phases.

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,060
First and foremost, it
is important to adopt

183
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,319
a good IT risk management framework.

184
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,100
Next, perform threat modeling.

185
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,203
Third, adopt key security
axioms of principles.

186
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,390
Fourth, adopt a good
cybersecurity framework.

187
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,360
And combining these earlier phases,

188
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,610
allows you to determine
more prescriptively,

189
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,480
security control objectives in
the context of your business

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,100
and environment, as well as
determine the system technology

191
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,010
and solution architectures.

192
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,880
Good governance entails
doing the right things

193
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,230
and doing the things right.

194
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,670
The last part of the equation,

195
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,520
entails doing the right things,

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,000
and the right part on
doing the things right.

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,780
The first phase of good governance

198
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,319
is to adopt a robust IT
risk management framework.

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,740
How do you know how much risk to tolerate?

200
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,490
And how much risk to mitigate?

201
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,950
And down to what acceptable level?

202
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,079
It is not about enabling security.

203
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,569
It is all about enabling the business.

204
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,810
There're needs to be a
strong alignment of business

205
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,203
operations and IT.

206
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,610
Everyone must have the single post insight

207
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,173
to synchronize resources and efforts.

208
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,050
In my dictionary, it is
never about minimizing risk.

209
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,969
Simply for the fact that there
can never be 100% security.

210
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,730
And therefore, any goal posts
of minimizing risk ends up

211
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,980
to be in a bottomless pit,

212
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,773
to sink in resources efforts
with no goal in sight.

213
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,500
It is actually really
about optimizing risk.

214
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,670
We do not want to overdo cybersecurity.

215
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,360
As a business, needs
to take calculated risk

216
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,070
which equates to optimizing risk

217
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,510
to just the right level of
tolerance and acceptance.

218
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,110
I shared earlier about
mindset and the three C's.

219
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,220
The raci has to be clear,

220
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
in terms of who is accountable for risk.

221
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,620
Ultimately he who holds the purse strings,

222
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,920
he or she who holds the
purse strings and can decide

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,209
how much to spend, is the risk owner.

224
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,490
After all, he is accountable for the

225
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,460
success of a system or project.

226
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,950
And determines the acceptable risk level,

227
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,310
and how much to spend on
mitigating cyber risks

228
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,849
to optimal levels.

229
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,850
The first, just I've shown
you the IT risk framework.

230
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,209
That's the first phase.

231
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,400
So now, other than cyber risk,

232
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,340
there is also the
business risk of adoption

233
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,900
versus the non-adoption of DevOps.

234
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,590
I have shared some of the
risk of adoption earlier.

235
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,030
About the cyber issues and threats.

236
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,260
But, what do you think are
the risk of non-adoption?

237
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,880
There is the likelihood
of losing out on having

238
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,650
a competitive advantage,
being less versatile in a job.

239
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,090
The opportunity cost for
the petitioner is higher.

240
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,880
There're more overheads with
slower testing and deployments.

241
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,310
And with that you may result in

242
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,060
shadow adoption of
undesired DevOps practices,

243
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,699
that have not undergone

244
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,053
the rigor of a security
by design deployment.

245
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,579
Just think about the recent cases of

246
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,060
deployment of Docker images
with cryptomining back doors.

247
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,810
The next phase is about
performing threat modeling.

248
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,329
We need to understand our enemies.

249
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,940
In the cyber security realm,

250
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,920
MITRE ATT&CK framework is widely adopted

251
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,290
as one of primary means to model threats.

252
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,260
Every advanced persistent
threat group and campaign

253
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,970
has a modus operandi.

254
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,500
And it falls under the seven tactics

255
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,703
of the cyber Kill Chain.

256
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,840
And hundreds of techniques
and sub techniques under each

257
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,743
tactic within the attack framework.

258
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,240
By understanding how adversarial tactics

259
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,410
and techniques work helps us to determine,

260
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,670
whether there are gaps in our defenses,

261
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,719
and how to better address them.

262
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
As soon as we put it across.

263
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
know our enemies are know ourselves

264
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,600
and we will win all hundred battles.

265
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,830
But are the attacks on the
clock platform as a service

266
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,970
or infrastructure as a service?

267
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,580
As a cloud service
provider deployed solutions

268
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,897
to address them.

269
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,503
Are your backups in
place the restore images?

270
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,260
Should they be encrypted
by ransomware for instance.

271
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,080
The third phase is about

272
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,100
adopting key security
principles and fundamentals.

273
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,950
In different terms,

274
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,410
it is about deploying "security as code".

275
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,800
It means that security
should be in automated,

276
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,209
not just in the design but as
default and during deployment,

277
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,390
supported by communications.

278
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,569
For all these translates to
in terms of actionable items

279
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,660
and the corresponding items
to the right of the arrows.

280
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,149
I just want to quickly
highlight two key areas.

281
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,853
First being continuous
audit and monitoring.

282
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Security is a continuous process.

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,030
A lot of cloud deployments
fall apart to hackers,

284
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,893
because the security posture
was not continually maintained.

285
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,760
The initial setup is never
the be all and end all.

286
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,697
The second area being the
extension to supply chain.

287
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:25,673
The suppliers upstream
and customers downstream

288
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,570
can greatly impact the
security of your systems,

289
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,170
due to the trust relationship established.

290
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,390
Therefore the results of
any security posturing tools

291
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,340
should be extended to them if possible.

292
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,210
In a longer the organization I worked in,

293
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,740
I extended phishing simulation
exercises to my customers

294
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,290
as a value added service to them.

295
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,849
And I know very clearly
that if they get breached,

296
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,610
we are also affected.

297
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,263
In addition, time and again
we hear this being mentioned.

298
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,089
Privacy-by-Design is really important

299
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,540
and should be integrated
with Security-by-Design.

300
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,800
How are you protecting

301
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,689
potentially sensitive PII
information in the cloud?

302
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,350
In the first phase of
doing the right things,

303
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,950
we need to adopt an industry

304
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,610
recognized cybersecurity
framework, just choose one.

305
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,040
COBIT from ISACA is widely
adopted in some cities,

306
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,089
and especially by financial institutions.

307
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,250
This governance framework
is an amalgamation of

308
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,350
various governance frameworks
and standards as well.

309
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,840
It has a mapping against
various ISO standards

310
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,963
and NIST cybersecurity framework as well.

311
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,480
Remember earlier on I
shared that in this era of

312
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,780
increased cyber attacks in the new normal,

313
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,199
we need to adopt and
assume breach thinking.

314
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,070
With this thinking,
emphasis needs to be placed

315
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,623
on the NIST CSF's detect,
respond and recover pillars.

316
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,750
So that the cyber Kill
Chain can be disrupted early

317
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,920
to contain and minimize
impact to the business.

318
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,229
ISACA research has shown
that enterprises that use

319
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,690
CMMI on COBIT 5, can align
their DevOps approach

320
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,260
to gain value and apply
adaptive approaches

321
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,319
to address challenges.

322
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,080
By adapting robust governance
and maturity practices

323
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,570
from this framework,

324
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,052
while maintaining a flexible
approach to interpreting

325
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:20,270
requirements, enterprises can
realize the benefits of DevOps

326
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,410
while at the same time, achieve
higher order of maturity.

327
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,480
Beyond standard frameworks,
there are also guidelines

328
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,656
you can refer to provide more guidance in

329
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,750
the correct things to do.

330
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,060
For instance, Association
of Bank of Singapore

331
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,160
have provided a few guidelines,

332
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,500
such as OSPAR or outsourced
service provider assessment.

333
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,120
Such assessments can be used for assessing

334
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,030
cloud service providers.

335
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,848
Besides the cloud service allows us

336
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,449
cloud control matrix guidelines.

337
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,170
On the topic of cloud security,

338
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,390
which is integral to DevOps adoption.

339
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,140
Here are some of the key
Cloud Security Considerations.

340
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,830
For both pre-deployment, as
well as during deployment.

341
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,180
Remember the key principles
of security-by-design

342
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,220
and security in deployment.

343
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,700
One of the key concerns in this list is

344
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,920
incident management process and drills,

345
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,940
as well as forensics
process during a breach.

346
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,190
Perform the tabletop exercises
incident drills involve,

347
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,963
involving your Cloud service providers.

348
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,379
Such as in the identification containment

349
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,973
and eradication phases.

350
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,983
Right.

351
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:30,903
Do all stakeholders know
the raci of who does what?

352
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,000
As for forensics process,

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,670
recall the Cloud deployment
allows for elastic

354
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,390
auto provisioning and de-provisioning.

355
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,850
What do you think happens
when a breached image

356
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,629
gets the proficient into the common pool?

357
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,220
Can you still make a
forensics image out of it?

358
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,870
Especially if it has
already been repositioned

359
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,229
for other use.

360
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,000
Such considerations has to be discussed

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,620
with your Cloud service provider.

362
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,040
So the image is kept at least

363
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,700
for a reasonable period of time.

364
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,740
So that the forensics image
can still be performed.

365
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,930
Most is the need to assess

366
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,630
the asset criticality and sensitivity.

367
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,270
You can only protect what you know.

368
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,540
Which of the controls
you see on the right,

369
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,250
the raci must be clear.

370
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,530
If it is put up generally as
everyone's responsibility,

371
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,160
we know very well, it ends up
being nobody's responsibility.

372
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,500
Eventually the process of
having the architecture security

373
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,110
reviewed by the architecture Review Board

374
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,263
with the right approvals must be in place.

375
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,060
In my view, in the relocation to the crop,

376
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,310
the security posture of premise in

377
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,169
the public or budget private Cloud

378
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,230
should not be worse off than on-premise.

379
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,290
Otherwise the increased risk
Delta has to be acceptable

380
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,470
by the risk owner.

381
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,470
For instance, due to business
direction and objective.

382
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,730
Earlier slides shows the
D pre-deployment controls.

383
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,940
This slide shows briefly
some of the key controls

384
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,380
as part of the deploy
security in deployment.

385
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,810
Of our most important is
change management controls

386
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,840
and regular checkpoint meetings.

387
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,360
I shared earlier, Cloud
posture deteriorates

388
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
if it is not maintained.

389
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,270
Regular meetings and stalk
taking helps to maintain

390
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,730
that posture.

391
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,150
I shared earlier that
one of the issues is with

392
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,310
security patch levels.

393
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,020
It is important to know that
good property management

394
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,920
does not entail blindly
patching all the time.

395
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,450
Patching just a means to an end,

396
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,950
which is to have a vulnerability resolved.

397
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,250
There are many ways to fix vulnerabilities

398
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,921
from disabling unnecessary services

399
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,563
to establishing virtual
patching, et cetera.

400
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:29,030
In addition, a proper
property remediation timeline

401
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,230
is important.

402
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,110
All too often I see that
this requirement is often

403
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,149
left up in the discussion with
the cloud service provider.

404
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,420
Is the cloud service providers'

405
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,610
prerogative resolution
timeline in adherence

406
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,449
with your corporate timeline?

407
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,120
Such vulnerability remediation
timeline must be risk based,

408
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,729
so as to determine whether
such as determine whether

409
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,480
there is an exploit in the wall,

410
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,560
and also differentiation during peacetime

411
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,649
versus this state of
heightened monitoring.

412
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,350
where risk is elevated and
remediation needs to be

413
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,310
more timely as a result.

414
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,620
In the assumed breach top process,

415
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,520
Incident Management is of key focus.

416
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,840
Therefore, we should consider
elevating the maturity of

417
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,330
incident management process and what was

418
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,750
predictive maturity stage.

419
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,930
Some of the key areas
of consideration until

420
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,780
the detect, respond and
recovers stages of the

421
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,830
NIST cybersecurity framework.

422
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,659
First do you have a baseline of a system

423
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,200
to allow any unauthorized
changes to your system

424
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,110
to be easily identified?

425
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,040
Next, do you consider Black Swan events

426
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,170
in your incident playbooks?

427
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,710
Such as massive ransomware
or ransom (mumbles)

428
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,720
across all your infrastructure
or platforms in the cloud.

429
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,490
Have you also consider business
continuity in your cloud?

430
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,620
Would you consider a multi
cloud infrastructure?

431
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,800
When a massive outbreak
affects your organization,

432
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,950
what do you recover
first and in what order?

433
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,070
If emails don't, want
alternative communications

434
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,629
would you consider et cetera et cetera.

435
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,940
I know for a fact that a number
of cloud service providers

436
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,660
whom I knew got breached,
had quickly established

437
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,150
an active cyber defense strategy.

438
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,430
This is again based on
assumed breach mentality.

439
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,130
An active cyber defense
strategy entails the ingestion

440
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,480
of Threat Intelligence,
Network Security Monitoring,

441
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,860
Incident Response and finally

442
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,350
Threat and Environment Manipulation.

443
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,030
This also follows what is
known as the OODA model

444
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,500
on the right, to actively
perform hunting of threats.

445
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,040
Other events in a club
monitor by SIEM and SOAR

446
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,070
for threat hunting and correlation.

447
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,090
The last phase in doing the things right

448
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,220
entails going through the
phases of architecting

449
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,150
and designing a solution architecture.

450
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,220
That's optimized with resolution risk

451
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,800
translated into business
speak to be approved

452
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,669
by the risk owner.

453
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,820
The security catalog has
to be accordingly developed

454
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,189
for standardization and consistency

455
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,820
in the DevOps deployment.

456
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Next, I go into more on DevOps,
Baking Security into DevOps.

457
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,800
My next few slides are oriented on

458
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,350
examples of applying the earlier mentioned

459
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,399
governance framework, onto
Baking Security into DevOps

460
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,763
and identifying how some
things can be done right.

461
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,410
CI with automation
allows better integration

462
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,690
of security tools and
secure code review tools,

463
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,350
such as (mumbles) scanner
should definitely be deployed.

464
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,810
Configuration management,
such as using SCAP

465
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,340
or security control automation protocol,

466
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,360
should be adopted and include
the aspects of logging,

467
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,330
alerting and security metrics.

468
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,669
As containers allow
isolation of application,

469
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,563
there are also tools available
to scan Docker images

470
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,220
for their posture and such
tools should be adopted.

471
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,858
CIS should be used for benchmarking

472
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:47,679
and their tools can be utilized to scan

473
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,390
Docker images as well.

474
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,610
In addition cloud service provider portals

475
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,810
and integrated API's
also assist in providing

476
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,570
independent verification
of automated in inventory

477
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,720
and should be utilized.

478
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,330
Asset tracking and
vulnerability scanning tools

479
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,530
such as Qualys should be used.

480
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,889
Not least, process should be
established to ensure that

481
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,580
any updates to the infrastructure,

482
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,770
such as code security
configuration triggers

483
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,020
and automated application
scan or SCAP check.

484
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,010
In the DevOps tool chain,

485
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,250
what we have been advocating
is a shift left approach.

486
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,050
To ensure that code is deployed securely

487
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,350
in the security and deployment approach.

488
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,149
Which entails the above two circles.

489
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,010
In addition to the above, I
just want to point out that

490
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,920
it is also important to consider

491
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,360
what is on the right of the cue chain.

492
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,929
which is the continual monitoring

493
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,190
and incident management processes.

494
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,010
In a rush to speed to market,
these are often left out.

495
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,320
Again, I want to stress
the importance of ensuring

496
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,800
security event triggers
are built into the code

497
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,310
to allow proper base
lining and breaches to be

498
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,399
more readily identified.

499
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,500
Now, let me discuss a bit on

500
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,320
security remediation
deployment strategies.

501
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,610
There are essentially
two types of strategy.

502
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,800
One is A-B testing which
entails having scans

503
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,440
integrated as part of deployment,

504
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,220
to provide immediate verification
in a gradual rollout,

505
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,490
or push.

506
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,470
a variant of this approach
which is less disruptive,

507
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,880
is the rollout newly patched

508
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,045
or security remediated
image files in new VMs,

509
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,620
by scaling the system up
and then removing the older

510
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,860
and remediated un-patched
systems when scaling down.

511
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,929
This process is more
seamless and less painful.

512
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,900
Lastly, I would like to
address one of the issues I

513
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,103
highlighted earlier on,
including segregation of duties.

514
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,760
The trouble is that it is
not always guaranteed that

515
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,800
the development,
operations or QA personnel

516
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,960
will be focused on ensuring
security compliance,

517
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,690
due to maximizing business
flexibility and speed to market.

518
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,240
And often because static and
dynamic code testing requires

519
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,750
application code to be extant to operate,

520
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,620
the way they are deployed
needs to be modified

521
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,719
to fit a DevOps approach.

522
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,190
Because DevOps meant fully
automate runway to production.

523
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,660
How results are captured,

524
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,470
and the way they feedback correctly

525
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,620
into the development processes,

526
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,070
need to be properly established.

527
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,669
Separation of duties,
or segregation of duties

528
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,150
can still be ensured for instance by

529
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,690
severely restricting developer access,

530
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,240
with detailed change control locks created

531
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
and tied to every change.

532
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,360
So that every adjustment is auditable.

533
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,870
A detection approach instead
of a prevention approach

534
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,939
is emphasized over here.

535
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,560
I would like to conclude by saying that

536
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,730
for DevSecOps to be successful
it needs to be internalized,

537
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,660
and that entails security
assurance and governance,

538
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,160
through automated configuration systems

539
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,228
and a collection of reliable metrics

540
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:53,460
to measure governance and performance.

541
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,750
To measure governance performance.

542
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,460
Good governance is the key to ensuring

543
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,810
robust DevSecOps deployment.

544
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,060
I've shared the implementation of some of

545
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,120
critical cybersecurity controls
in the DevOps environment.

546
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,080
You can read more literature in this area

547
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,120
through the above references.

548
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,679
If you're ISACA member,

549
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,320
the first few references
are available to you.

550
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,010
All these references I find
helpful for further reading

551
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,440
and understanding.

552
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,800
I would like to end with a
brief introduction to ISACA.

553
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,610
ISACA is a leading global
provider of knowledge

554
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,639
certifications community,
advocacy and education

555
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,550
on Information Systems assurance,

556
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,620
and security enterprise
governance and management of IT.

557
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,022
IT related risk and
compliance with more than

558
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:37,830
145,000 members across 221
chapters in 188 countries.

559
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,866
In Singapore we have
more than 2500 members.

560
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,760
ISACA Singapore launches annual

561
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,810
GTACS International Conference.

562
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,080
And the upcoming one is
going to be held virtually

563
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,320
on 30th of August 2020.

564
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,220
And he will be graced
by Mr Gaurav Keerthi,

565
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,960
the Assistant Chief Executive for the

566
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,180
cybersecurity agency of Singapore.

567
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,210
We have a whole team of renowned speakers,

568
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,770
the detailed program is displayed here.

569
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,310
We have four key tracks on governance

570
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,500
and risk compliance and
audit, design architecture

571
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,550
as well as security planning and program.

572
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,900
Further details can also
be found on our website.

573
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,187
Attend this either pay a nominal
member rate of Singapore,

574
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:19,540
$28 or no member rate of Singaporean $48.

575
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,800
Do consider joining us
if you are available.

576
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,080
I should now end with this slide.

577
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,939
It is my belief that we are
only as strong as our ecosystem.

578
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,740
Therefore, the only way to
keep up with rising trends,

579
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,240
is to keep fighting
weaknesses in our own ideas.

580
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,650
And the reason it is important
to connect with one another.

581
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,170
I would love to hear from you.

582
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,033
Whether you agree, and especially
if you disagree and why.

583
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,330
You may know something that I don't.

584
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,220
So I look forward to
connecting and sharing ideas

585
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,100
and learning from one another.

586
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,020
Not least stay safe and stay secure.

587
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,853
Thank you.

588
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,740
If there're any questions
I'm happy to take them.

589
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,070
I may not have all the answers,

590
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,380
but I should share with you
my perspective and thoughts.

591
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:02,793
If anyone else has other
thoughts, feel free to chip in.

592
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,503
Whether you agree or disagree.

593
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,413
Thank you.
