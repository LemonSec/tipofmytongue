00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,420

I'd now like to turn it over to Ian Yip

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,133
for the presentation.

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,700
- Thank you. So welcome everybody.

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Ian Yep and
I'm the CEO of Avertro.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,770
And I'm going to talk about
a couple of key things

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,652
that had has a lot of
conversations over the years.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,010
Before I go on some contexts,

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,350
so I've had probably over 100
conversations on this topic,

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,500
particularly over the last year in trying

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,550
to learn about this topic
and help organizations do it.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,950
So the insights that
I've gained that built

20
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,820
this educational data,
come from discussions

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,369
and some of the work I've done.

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,789
I've not used specific real data points

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,040
to protect the anonymity of
the people I've spoken with,

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,290
which I'm sure they will appreciate,

25
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,400
but the concepts and the key messages

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,723
is still driven by real information.

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,020
Now, this specific topic,
as your should be aware,

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,200
has suddenly become a lot more relevant

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,510
over the last two to three years.

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,163
If you remember the
NotPetya incidents mess,

31
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,549
I guess he had to deal with two years ago.

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,930
I mean it cost him $300 million.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,560
So things like that
and the things you hear

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,400
in the news every single day,

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,170
are making boards and executives

36
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,480
that are not traditionally
understanding of security

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,359
to really take notice and start
to ask cybersecurity teams

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,113
what in the world is going on?

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,760
If you listen to Gartner,
they've said by this year

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,250
every single enterprise will
be asking the security teams

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,010
about cybersecurity technology
risk, at least annually,

42
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,060
in most cases actually more.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,350
Unfortunately, organizations
continue to struggle

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,730
with aligning these tracks
as a communication disconnect

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,209
between the cyber team which to use

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,010
a personology someone once said to me,

47
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,160
sometimes sound like a speaking Breton,

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,980
and the executive layer
which speaks human.

49
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,660
And that is something
that we need to address

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,650
as an industry if we wanna
be relevant moving forward.

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,770
Now, the first thing most
people do when they try

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,020
and understand how they can
tell a bit of cyber story

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,990
to executives and board,

54
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,000
and this is probably going to Google

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,830
And you do go to Google
and try and find examples

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,070
of how you might wanna articulate

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,430
the specific messages, you have to tell,

58
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,580
it's really hard to find anything.

59
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,790
I've tried it and we can go
ahead and try it yourself,

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,329
there aren't really a
lot of good examples.

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,810
The second issue is we're
used to in security industry,

62
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,340
as practitioners speaking
about speeds and feeds,

63
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,010
technical metrics much like
the ones you see on here.

64
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,310
We talk about intrusion attempts,

65
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,560
we talk about how many alerts we got,

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,940
we say we got 500
vulnerabilities last month,

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,510
we talk about acronyms
like MTTD, MTTR, MTTC

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,980
and a bunch of other things
that I didn't have space

69
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,820
on the slide to put into this deck.

70
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,760
And if you think about it,

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,350
unless you have done security before,

72
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,530
it's really difficult to understand

73
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,030
what any of these things mean.

74
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,107
Now before we move on about security,

75
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:07,660
let's change our viewpoint.

76
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,960
Let's look at what executives and boards

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,263
are used to looking at.

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,410
For the most part, they
are used to looking

79
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,070
at things called balanced scorecards.

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,620
And if you've ever seen
a balanced scorecard,

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,620
this is a very basic
framework that people follow.

82
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,280
You can keep on moving this around,

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,113
they have their own versions of it.

84
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:30,060
But typically, balanced
scorecard has a key objective,

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,300
and assess some objectives.

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,150
There's some messaging about
what things look like today.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,679
And then there needs to be an
articulation to the executives

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,460
and board members about
what we're trying to get to.

89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,739
And then there's a bunch of measurements

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,280
and actions that we're doing to get there.

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,140
For example, if you're talking
about an objective being

92
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,690
you wanna increase customer attention.

93
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,523
And you could be saying,

94
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,520
"Well, right now we're only
retaining half the customers,

95
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,870
which means our customer
lifetime values are $1,000.

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,110
we actually need to
double the lifetime value

97
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,410
of our customers and to do that,

98
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,110
we also need to make sure
we retain 80% of that.

99
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,390
Now below that is some of the detail,

100
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,870
which is still quite high
level and very plain language,

101
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,010
to talk about how you might wanna increase

102
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,010
customer retention.

103
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,590
So you probably wanna improve
the customer experience,

104
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,400
you probably need to
increase the satisfaction,

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,979
and you need to improve product quality.

106
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,290
And how do you measure these things?

107
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,810
Well currently be take the
example of customer experience,

108
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,180
maybe the average session
time that they have

109
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,710
on the platform is five minutes

110
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,159
and we need to get it to three minutes.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
And to improve it, we
actually do a UX refresh,

112
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
to impose 150K and so on.

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,720
So these are very, very
targeted, specific metrics

114
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,150
that board members can easily understand.

115
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,203
In fact, anyone can understand.

116
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:45,869
Look at this, it's quite clear
what you're trying to do.

117
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,020
Unfortunately, it's not so
easy to do this in security,

118
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,419
based on where we come from.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,340
Now, if you dig to level below and you go,

120
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,380
okay, if they wanna balanced scorecard

121
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,830
and they wanna be told a story,

122
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,960
what is it that you
need to be telling them?

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,092
What language do you need to be using?

124
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,930
This actually comes from a study
from my ex-employer, McAfee

125
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,490
that I was very involved with to try

126
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,020
and understand what
executives want to hear

127
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,409
and actually, which of them actually care.

128
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,810
So, back when we did the
study, and when I was McAfee,

129
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,099
we found that, for the most part,

130
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,969
people thought that CFOs
and CEOs cared the least,

131
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,480
about cyber risk.

132
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,730
And then the study asked why?

133
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,520
And it turned out,
there was a misalignment

134
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,090
in primarily organizational culture,

135
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,640
and a misalignment in
the KPIs and incentives

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,620
that they were measuring against.

137
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,760
So if you can't get
those two things right,

138
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
or if you don't understand

139
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,380
what they're being measured against,

140
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,500
it's really difficult
to get them the care.

141
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,990
So that's the first battle

142
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,380
and then if you're able
to understand those things

143
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,640
and better shoot and target your message

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,010
and and further align it
with a business strategy

145
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,590
and direction that the
company is trying to achieve.

146
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,140
So those are the core three
things that were found.

147
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,417
Now, if you take the next step and go

148
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,520
"Okay, if I can solve those things out,

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
what are the metrics I need to give them?"

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,730
And it turns out the metrics
are very much aligned

151
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,310
to what you saw on the previous slide.

152
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,290
They want you to tell them about

153
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,750
the risks that we're managing,

154
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,670
the controls we have in place,

155
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,070
and the organizational
metrics that make sense

156
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,530
for the business.

157
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,289
And if you have some
financial info, great.

158
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,230
They care much less about
the technology, KPIs,

159
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,930
and the threat response
and protection type

160
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,410
things that we're so used to
articulating to everybody,

161
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,840
including executives.

162
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,020
It explains why they don't care,

163
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,853
because they don't understand it,

164
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:39,087
they care much more about
these other three things

165
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,563
that you see here.

166
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,110
So for to summarize a lot of
the findings from that study,

167
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,033
some of which I didn't show the stats for,

168
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,659
it's you need to be able to
articulate threats and impacts

169
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,390
using plain language.

170
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,763
Things need to be brief,

171
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,910
if you can talk about things
in financial terms and costs

172
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,310
and it helps if you can
bring an independent view,

173
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,180
whether it's some assistance from external

174
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,290
or a scientific way to measure or defend

175
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,020
what you're putting up to them,

176
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,813
that shows you aren't
being subjective about it.

177
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,090
Now you're gonna ask me again,
what do they normally ask?

178
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,710
So these are the key
questions that they ask.

179
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,060
And they're basically
separated in two columns.

180
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,518
They wanna know the why and the what

181
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,568
and they wanna know the how and the when.

182
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,920
So you need to answer
primarily, why do they care?

183
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,559
And if they can get in the care,
then you have to articulate

184
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
Well, what are we protecting?

185
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,000
What are the actual risks we have?

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,380
How good are we at protecting ourselves?

187
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,110
What are the outcomes we wanna achieve?

188
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,930
Again, in plain language,
not technical speak.

189
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,319
And if we're not quite there,
then where are the gaps?

190
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
And if you can answer that,
then you only gonna need

191
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,266
to answer, "Okay, well,
I understand all that.

192
00:08:56,267 --> 00:09:00,080
Now, I've told that story,
now I need to tell them

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,750
how I'm gonna do my job to get there

194
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,700
and when we're gonna get there.

195
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,880
Which means you need to measure it.

196
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,040
You need to be able to articulate

197
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,390
what we're currently doing.

198
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,730
And if say isn't enough,
what do we need to do more?

199
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,290
And what are the specific
things we're gonna be doing,

200
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,230
to get it to the outcomes,
we say we're gonna get to

201
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,930
and be able to justify
that you're spending

202
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,762
the exact amount?

203
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,940
Because you may be
spending way too little,

204
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
which case you need to be
able to build a business case

205
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,730
to say, "Well, we need a
little bit more because..."

206
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,440
And then finally, you need to say,

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,273
when are you gonna get there.

208
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,157
Are we gonna get there in six months?

209
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,950
Are we gonna get there in two years?

210
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,980
Are we gonna get there in five years?

211
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,480
That is really critical
because they want to know.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,540
Now they are aware that
cyber risk is a huge issue.

213
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,860
So they're also getting educated.

214
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,190
So here's a sampling of some
of the educational materials

215
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,600
that they insure.

216
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,050
So I'm based in Australia,

217
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,540
so the Australian Institute
of Company Directors

218
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,300
has actually got a course that teaches

219
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,620
board members about cyber risk.

220
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,420
And this course specifically
teaches them about governance,

221
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,163
risk and strategy.

222
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,380
Exactly the things that the study

223
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,963
I was referring to since
they want to hear about.

224
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,150
Now what else do they learn?

225
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,530
It's about the terms and concepts
of some very basic terms.

226
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,870
So they can at least understand

227
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,260
a little bit of the cyber terms

228
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,240
you use, but not necessarily
all the specific jargon

229
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,890
that we use.

230
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,270
They need to understand
what the responsibility is,

231
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,490
so they can actually
show they're performing

232
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,673
their duty of care.

233
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,610
And the need to be able to
identify all the opportunities,

234
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,630
or understand what you're
identifying some opportunities

235
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,403
for improvement,

236
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,550
and then be able to follow
that along to the understanding

237
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,060
what the strategy is, when you show them

238
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,280
what you're gonna do about it.

239
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,270
This is a slightly separate,
a different organization

240
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,300
and as a sample of the guidance around

241
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,310
what somebody should be
sharing to the board.

242
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,199
I would argue this a
little bit too much detail,

243
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,735
this is probably the thing you wanna show

244
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,400
and they're go like, "Okay,
show me some detail."

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,439
This is probably not the first thing

246
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,273
you should be showing them.

247
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,020
But this is part of educational material.

248
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,819
And this is look at the very least,

249
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,210
you can be able to break
down the capabilities we have

250
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,360
and just do the standard risk,

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,330
the grid emigrating, give the score,

252
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,593
say we are getting better or not.

253
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:22,975
That's a good starting point.

254
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,987
And then it's up to you
to articulate exactly

255
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:28,607
how you wanna show it or how
high level you wanna start.

256
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,160
And then you go to
consulting firms, obviously.

257
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,170
So I worked for one in the past,

258
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,699
this happens to be specifically

259
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,310
from one of the really big
ones that's publicly available.

260
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,319
And they work outside in,
they're very much talking about

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,430
understanding the organizational

262
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,359
and governance type approaches.

263
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,420
And then that chart on the
right really talks about

264
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,219
the process for how you
do some of the homework,

265
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,053
which we'll get to at the end,

266
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,783
but it's ultimately by
identifying your risk,

267
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,750
your tolerance levels, figuring out gaps

268
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,690
and then understanding
how you're gonna get them.

269
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,760
So how do you set yourself
up to be successful?

270
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,069
How do you make sure you are the hero

271
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,430
in your own cyber story when you level up

272
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,060
and tell your executives
and the board members,

273
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,560
what a great job you're doing?

274
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,980
Now you need to make sure
that these are the goals

275
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,813
that you have.

276
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,650
You want to make sure they align with you.

277
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,050
So the language you use,
the way you articulate it

278
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,707
absolutely has to do that.

279
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:33,217
You need to be able to
use your message to say,

280
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,939
"Look, we're more than just a cost center,

281
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,880
we're actually a strategic
function and this

282
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,237
is the value we bring."

283
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,319
And the main thing is you
need to be able to prove

284
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,340
as a security leader, that
you're doing cyber, right,

285
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,173
'cause that's actually
what they all wanna know.

286
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,310
Are you doing it right?

287
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,250
'Cause if you're doing it
right then they're covered

288
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,840
and they've done the right things

289
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,850
and they've checked the right things

290
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,833
and they've asked the right questions.

291
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,583
So how do you actually elevate
your cyber security game?

292
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,070
I've kind of alluded to it,

293
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,884
but you really have to answer
the why and so what questions.

294
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,060
If you don't, you're missing a trick

295
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,579
and you're not actually leveling
out where you should be.

296
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,000
Plain language we talked
about, don't give them detail

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,590
unless asked to start really high level.

298
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,980
Now one thing I'm also good at in cyber

299
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,270
is forecasting looking forward.

300
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,930
So you need to figure out a
way of how you can articulate

301
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,390
what things gonna look like
in six months, 12 months, 18,

302
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,013
two years, whatever your
strategy looks like,

303
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,689
and you need to justify why
you're spending the $10 million

304
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:31,660
or $20 million on your operational program

305
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,439
and your transformation program,

306
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,793
which helps you validate your strategy.

307
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,010
And if you break down your team,

308
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,510
this is the outcome you ideally wanna get

309
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,160
if you tell the right story.

310
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,020
The leaders amongst you will have

311
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,670
proper alignment with business.

312
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,719
The risk teams, will ideally
have continuous visibility

313
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,650
about all the risks that you're tracking.

314
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,600
But you'll know we haven't

315
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,310
because you should be
managing third-parties better

316
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,579
and then security operations team

317
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,670
will finally be recognized for
the ninjas they really are,

318
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,599
instead of having people go work as team

319
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,170
really do understand anything they say

320
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,069
most of it is communication.

321
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,780
Now, the language of the
board and c-suite is risk,

322
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,180
whether you're talking about a heat map,

323
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,069
which most people have seen,
or a quantitative measure

324
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,410
is so risk, so different organizations

325
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,780
use different methods.

326
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,747
For the most part, it's
one of these three things,

327
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:24,640
and if you're not able to articulate cyber

328
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,760
in the context of risks,
then you're gonna find it

329
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,020
very hard to level up
and speak their language.

330
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,010
I'll give you an example.

331
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,670
So very often we talk about,
we have 500 vulnerabilities

332
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,050
in our cloud infrastructure
that need to be address.

333
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,010
Ask yourself the question, is
this really a business risk

334
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,760
or is it actually a technical risk?

335
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,780
Here's another example.

336
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,400
We often talk about a fleet of servers

337
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,819
in the data center have not been patched

338
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,183
for a period of time.

339
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,020
And we try and tell our
board members and executives

340
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,000
that these are issues.

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,430
But this is a business
risk or a technical risk?

342
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,913
Now your test for that
is ask yourself so what?

343
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:05,910
Like so we're used to talking about

344
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,368
the fact is 500
vulnerabilities, ask so what?

345
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,910
if you can't answer this so what question,

346
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,240
it is not a business risk.

347
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,300
So if I specifically talked
about those two examples,

348
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
what you should be saying, potentially,

349
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,959
for the 500 vulnerabilities
is the so what answer,

350
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,910
becomes, well, this increases
the risk of exploitation

351
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,910
of sensitive data that we
have stored in our cloud,

352
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,290
that rules potentially could
result in regulatory fines.

353
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,435
That is something
executive will understand,

354
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,650
that is something that
answers so what question.

355
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,220
I'd be second example.

356
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,010
The so what level of that is,

357
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,280
well, that will cause system
unavailability risks to go up

358
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,970
as a result of malicious cyber attack,

359
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,080
which means we can't process
financial transactions.

360
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,330
So language is very different.

361
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,100
It's plain, it's leveled
up, but it still links

362
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,730
to the technical risk
you're trying to articulate,

363
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,500
but it makes sense in
the context of business

364
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,193
because you've answered
the so what question.

365
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,630
Executive and board members
really only care about

366
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,230
the business risks.

367
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,710
So if you bring those two examples back,

368
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,073
we're actually talking
about a data breach risk

369
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:16,090
for the first one, and availability
risk for the second one.

370
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,800
It's not about the 500 vulnerabilities

371
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,699
and it's not about the
unpatched fleet of servers

372
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,990
in the data center.

373
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,583
Those are just symptoms of a bigger risk.

374
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,120
Now, let's prepare yourself.

375
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,110
How do you prepare
yourself for that game day

376
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,713
to tell that story regularly?

377
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,680
Like everything you need
to do your homework.

378
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,727
So first thing, do you know
what your risk tolerance are?

379
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,850
"Cause he was speaking about risk?

380
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,423
They always gonna know what
to know? What can we tolerate?

381
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,890
And if you've never done
tolerance levels before,

382
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,590
it's effectively the
lower the tolerance level,

383
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,330
the more you don't want it to happen.

384
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,440
So if you're gonna low
tolerance for data breach,

385
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
you really don't want
data breaches to happen.

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,040
If you got a high tolerance for something

387
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,630
it's not nice if it happens,
but you can probably handle

388
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,770
the impact as a result.

389
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,609
So in this case, in this
example that you're seeing,

390
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,500
defacement risk having
a higher tolerance level

391
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,920
means look we don't like to
defacement of our website,

392
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,470
but if it does happen,
it's not nearly as bad as

393
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,650
if we get breached

394
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,790
or if we have a system availability issue.

395
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,490
So it's as simple as that.

396
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,760
Sometimes it takes a bit of thinking,

397
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,640
because it's actually the opposite logic,

398
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,970
but that's all in the
tolerance levels means.

399
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,983
So you need to be able to articulate

400
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:31,460
your cyber risk tolerance levels
for all the business risks

401
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,510
that you're managing.

402
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,649
And if you can try and get

403
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,210
to some sort of financial impact,

404
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,290
where the risk quantitatively calculating,

405
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,659
which in some cases is quite hard,

406
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,140
but there are ways to do it,

407
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,930
or just use a couple of
publicly available numbers

408
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,350
that are published by
various research firms

409
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,399
or use real numbers internally
when you've had an incident

410
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,180
and calculate the costs
of that and averaged that.

411
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,340
There are different ways to do it,

412
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,689
but if you get to a cost, it really helps

413
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,300
because it actually articulates

414
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,450
and shows them what the worst case impact

415
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,090
for say a data breach could
be for the organization,

416
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,850
because as you saw earlier,
they actually care about costs

417
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,050
more than anything else.

418
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,990
Now, once you've got that sorted,

419
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,890
you actually need to figure out,

420
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,130
okay, where do we really stand?

421
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,410
We have a tolerance level
of low for data breach,

422
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,870
but where are we currently?

423
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,679
And executives and CFOs,
CEOs typically wanna know,

424
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,997
okay, are we in the red?

425
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:27,330
Are we in the orange, yellow or green?

426
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,610
Green is good, red is bad.

427
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,506
So whenever they see
something in the red, they go

428
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:33,380
"Well you need to fix this
part from being be red."

429
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,213
This is as simple as that.

430
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,420
So if you're able to quantitatively say

431
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,130
a specific risk is in the red,

432
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,160
and we need to do something about it,

433
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,993
that's them saying,

434
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,139
"Okay we understand, now, what
are you gonna do about it?"

435
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,887
As opposed to the opposite where you go,

436
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,159
"I need a bunch of firewalls

437
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,780
and I need a bunch of
EDR systems and so on."

438
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,812
Then that doesn't answer
the risk question for them.

439
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,490
Now, related to that is capabilities,

440
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,810
because if you think about it,

441
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,040
as your capabilities get
better, the risks come down.

442
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,280
So you'll also need to be able

443
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,500
to articulate your capabilities.

444
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,010
And it might be a frank
favorite framework of choice,

445
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,960
be it the new CSF for ISO 27, the blue one

446
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,930
or something you decided
to craft for your own,

447
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,230
but here's a simple example.

448
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,100
If you talk about your
capabilities across the six areas,

449
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,770
asset management, business
environment, and so on,

450
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,603
you need to be able to say

451
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:25,670
"Okay, what capabilities are
currently at a score of three?"

452
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,760
For example.

453
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,960
But it's not good enough
because a score three means

454
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,300
that data breach risk is still too high.

455
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,350
And for me to bring my
data breach risk down

456
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,360
to my tones low,

457
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,320
I need to increase my maturity
level for asset management,

458
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,620
business environment to a higher number.

459
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,560
And you need to be able
to say what the number is,

460
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,600
so they're all relate it
and you can actually track

461
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,913
and measure those metrics over time.

462
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,490
And then you need to say
how I'm gonna close gaps.

463
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,323
So you might...

464
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,460
You'll say, "Look, I need
to increase my maturity

465
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,293
and capabilities,

466
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,810
I need to reduce my risks."

467
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,740
And here are the set of
things I'm going to do

468
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,203
to get us there.

469
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,179
So it could be in the form of
a bunch of project activities,

470
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,783
which typically looks like a program plan.

471
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,330
You've probably all got program plans

472
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,156
some are driven by what is,

473
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:13,293
but what's the right way to do it

474
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:14,860
that the boss is gonna care
about, for the most part,

475
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,639
sure they care about what is,

476
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,790
but you wanna talk about
making impact to the business

477
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,940
and making strategic to
has it tied to the risks

478
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,360
and capabilities that
you're trying to address.

479
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,370
And more than that, make
sure that you're able

480
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,000
to build a business case around it.

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,270
You're gonna spend a million dollars

482
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,420
has to align to business goals,
has to be the right number,

483
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,837
and you have to be able to
justify that number by saying,

484
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,090
"If I spend less, we're
not gonna get to targets,

485
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,730
if I spend more we're probably overshoot.

486
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,930
So this is the exact number."

487
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,030
And if you're able to
articulate all those things

488
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,980
and show them that that goes a long way

489
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,490
and that literally is your business case.

490
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,883
And then most importantly
monitoring and report progress

491
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,120
'cause they're gonna ask you
every month, every two months

492
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,260
or three months out, how are we tracking

493
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,110
with the amount of money we gave you?

494
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,500
Now, it helps to have simple metrics.

495
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,210
Fairly or unfairly, the
board members, executives

496
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,230
like looking one number,

497
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,533
because sometimes you've
only got five minutes

498
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:12,483
and you've got to be able to
tell the story really quickly.

499
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,947
So if you can tell that story by saying,

500
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:16,969
"Look, I'm gonna go one minute,

501
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,050
this is the number we are currently at,

502
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,389
we need to get to a better number."

503
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,050
And then they go "Great,
you're doing a job move on."

504
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,510
Or they really interested
they'll give you more time,

505
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,010
you can explain what a score of 75/100

506
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,210
for a cyber resilience score is.

507
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,640
That score typically needs to be made out

508
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,652
of the things I've just talked about.

509
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:34,080
How are our risk tracking?

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,689
How are our capabilities tracking?

511
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,163
How is our program tracking?

512
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,629
But ultimately, you need
to be able to explain

513
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,190
why and so what if they start
to dig behind these numbers

514
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,130
and make it repeatable.

515
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,760
So if this analogy is really
good in terms of a bridge,

516
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,600
you need to bridge the gap permanently

517
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,120
by focusing on the business representation

518
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,943
of all the cyber things
you used talked about.

519
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,399
And you need to be able to
translate and normalize it

520
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,163
and repeat it continuously.

521
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,283
So on game day, what do you have to do?

522
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,840
Now, before we go on,

523
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,639
like I acknowledge there are times

524
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,680
you'll have to stand in front of the board

525
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,270
and they still wanna
talk about and incidents,

526
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,103
this is in the back,

527
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:16,936
'cause it gonna be different every time.

528
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,639
This is about a regular rhythm that you go

529
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,630
to report on the cyber,
this is how we're doing,

530
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,310
this is a strategy, we're
fine, we're not fine

531
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,610
and then we'll do it again next month.

532
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,070
So this is not about consumers' trust.

533
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,649
Now, your delivery and
ability to communicate

534
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,710
and present will actually
get you really far.

535
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,820
So if you're not a confident
presenter, actually,

536
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,500
you should get trained.

537
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,593
It actually helps.

538
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,210
And a confident presenter
tells a better story

539
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,580
and actually has them understanding

540
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,310
and having more certainty

541
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,649
that what you're saying is correct.

542
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,200
Scripting absolutely helps to prepare it

543
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,880
and know what's gonna say
before you're gonna say it.

544
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,420
All too often people don't do it,

545
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,530
and you need to practice it.

546
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,810
You need to make sure
the content looks good,

547
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,500
because we're used to
looking at pretty diagrams,

548
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,670
and if you show them something
that doesn't look pretty,

549
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,980
as superficial as that sounds,

550
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,470
it's not gonna get the message across.

551
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,580
You might be the best orator in the world,

552
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,500
you slides are bad or
your document looks bad,

553
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,510
you're doing yourself a disservice.

554
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,900
So get some help if you absolutely need,

555
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,460
if PowerPoint isn't your superpower,.

556
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,810
And then treat it like
you're gonna deliver

557
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,040
a keynote a large conference,

558
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,310
because that sets you
in the right mindset,

559
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,470
that gets you preparing properly,

560
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,460
and that gets you speaking confidently

561
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,963
and projecting properly.

562
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,370
And then have your one page ready ready.

563
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,600
If you're given five minutes,
you only have the one page.

564
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,090
So there is an example
that I put together,

565
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,810
that takes the balanced
scorecard we said earlier

566
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,870
and applies it to cyber risk.

567
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,540
Still have the goal,

568
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,889
we need to increase our cyber resilience.

569
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,000
Our current score is 25,
we need to get the 42.

570
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,460
And to do that we're reducing risk

571
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,170
and we're increasing capability.

572
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,730
And here are the current metrics,

573
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,970
here are the target metrics,
we are spending $15 million

574
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,070
but we're not doing so
well in the program,

575
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,879
because of a bunch of issues
that we have to deal with

576
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,970
in terms of resourcing,

577
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,010
or there may be things
outside of your control,

578
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,530
but you need to well explain that.

579
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,950
And you normally do this with colors.

580
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,010
So any red thing on there is the program

581
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,173
so they more than likely
ask you about that red.

582
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,320
And then beyond that,
if you have more time,

583
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,820
talk about the industry
and make it relevant.

584
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,860
Tell them how you're doing

585
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,830
and then tell them where
you're gonna get to

586
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,280
and whether it's enough.

587
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,760
And remember, start high level

588
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,740
and only go into detail if you need to.

589
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,190
So industry update might look like this,

590
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,000
we'll share a few news stories.

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,480
Avoid the fear, uncertainty, doubt,

592
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,610
but actually talk about the
context that is relevant

593
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,370
for the organization and
tell them how you're doing.

594
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,659
So this is a detail you might need.

595
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,140
So you have a score of 25 is made up

596
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,797
of risk, maturity, and
program, here are all the risks

597
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:50,300
and maturity and program specifics

598
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,669
that you might wanna show them.

599
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,180
Here's what we're doing well in,

600
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,130
here's what we're not doing so well in.

601
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,330
Here are the key risks
that outside of tolerance

602
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,290
and this is what we need
to be concerned about

603
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,389
or we're on top of it.

604
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,790
And in terms of capability,
here are the key capabilities

605
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,870
that were doing pretty
well in as they got better

606
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,040
and our program activities
on the whole are mixed bag,

607
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,129
maybe we have some great things here,

608
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,080
which is the cause of the red dot

609
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,330
that we had on the balanced scorecard.

610
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,379
And then talk about where
you're trying to get to.

611
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,690
And then they're gonna ask,
"Is that an acceptable score?

612
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,960
Is that enough?"

613
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,700
And you'll be able to say,
"Well, maybe, maybe not,

614
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,300
we're gonna be a little bit
over budget because of whatever.

615
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,090
and we're generally gonna be
a little bit late or early,

616
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,230
depending what's going on."

617
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,960
And then you show them
"Look, based on score of 42,

618
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,140
we're not gonna get the results.

619
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,750
For example, which might
suggest is not enough."

620
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,880
And that's your business case
to potentially ask for more

621
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,820
or they may say, "Look,
that's what we wanna spend."

622
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,206
In which case, your pushback needs to be

623
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,260
"Well, you need to raise
your tolerance level

624
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,560
so that we get to target."

625
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,097
So in summary, this is summary,

626
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:57,010
"We need to get the
42, we're not gonna get

627
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,500
the tolerance level if we're talking about

628
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,150
this specific example.

629
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,557
Or finish at a time, but a
little bit out of a budget.

630
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:06,490
We'll need adjust and that
really give you the ability

631
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,940
to have a business
conversation, not a cyber one.

632
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,389
So you need to build more,

633
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,530
here are some tips around
building business case.

634
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,110
Figure out what you need to add.

635
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,620
Clearly articulate the outcomes,

636
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,830
meaning, what numbers are we gonna get to?

637
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,370
What risks are we gonna reduce?

638
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,040
And how much we're gonna spend?

639
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,240
And give them options.

640
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,073
Here is option one,

641
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:25,200
here is option two, here is option three,

642
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,100
different spending, different metrics.

643
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,959
So to summarize, you need to
use the risk, business impact,

644
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,970
capabilities and outcomes in the way

645
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,130
you articulate your story.

646
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,940
Technical risks don't fly, so avoid them,

647
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,720
ask the same so what question.

648
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,420
Manage your progress
against a defensible plan.

649
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,100
Now investment journey can also be driven

650
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,969
by regulatory requirements,
but that's not enough,

651
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,180
it has to be driven by a
lot of these other things

652
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,870
because that's what they're asking for.

653
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,540
And you need to be able
to defend it logically,

654
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,830
if you're gonna say you're
doing a bunch of things.

655
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,350
So a couple of action items you
need to take away next week.

656
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,560
Figure out if you can actually
articulate your risks,

657
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,320
tolerance levels, and capabilities,

658
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,169
if not make a plan to do it.

659
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,700
Once you've sorted that out
within the next three months

660
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,310
to find the outcomes, you want to get to,

661
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,669
the tolerance levels,
your capability targets,

662
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,680
figure out if you're actually
gonna get to this targets

663
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,650
if not, you need to adjust the strategy.

664
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,700
And then in six months you
need to be able to do this

665
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,456
in a repeatable fashion.

666
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,240
And with that, I thank you for your time,

667
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,333
and thank you for listening.
