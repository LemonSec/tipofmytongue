00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,040
- Hello, and welcome to
Forced Digital Transformation

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,770
and the Realities to ICS/OT Cybersecurity.

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,080
If you're joining us live

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,987
our speaker is in

5
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:22,590
the Slido discussion area
right now, answering questions.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,300
He will also be leading
a live ask the experts

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,090
round table session on this topic.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,950
If you have audio or video issues,

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,290
I'd now like to turn it over to Robert Lee

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,879
for what I know will be
an excellent presentation.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,890
- Thanks so much (indistinct).

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,960
Alright, so welcome, welcome.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,380
What an interesting format

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,820
and definitely appreciate
RSA accommodating it.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,060
As noted I'm over the chat.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,900
So as I go through,

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,610
I might throw out some
questions to you all.

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,420
Please feel free to ask,

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,210
but I was interested in
presenting this content

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,760
specifically in light of everything

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,000
that's going around the world,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,780
the whole pandemic discussion

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,700
of kind of a pseudo kind of
forced digital transformation

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,550
that's happening to our infrastructure.

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,700
And what I mean by that.

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,414
And what I wanna walk
through in this presentation

28
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:11,460
is that connectivity
and hyper-connectivity

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,940
to our industrial operations,

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,707
be they oil and gas, electric,
manufacturing, maritime,

31
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:19,130
various industrial operations.

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,640
This kind of hyper-connectivity
has come very quickly

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,750
because of COVID,

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,430
where folks are accepting
remote interactions

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,760
and remote workforce and remote operations

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,953
in a way that they never
have before at scale.

37
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:35,040
And that actually can present
some interesting opportunities

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,610
to your company to take advantage of.

39
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,753
And at the same time it
presents interesting risks

40
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:42,760
really about what is
digital transformation

41
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,230
and what is this kind of
pseudo digital transformation

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,640
that's taking place

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,270
and how to take advantage
of it in a positive way.

44
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,070
Now to do this correctly,

45
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,270
it's useful to kind of
understand where we've come from

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,550
and where we're going as a community.

47
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,200
Now industrial control systems or ICS

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,260
or operations technology or OT,

49
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,280
sometimes people even talk IIOT

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,000
for industrial internet of things.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,340
But this discussion of industrial security

52
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,850
is quite interesting
where our systems predated

53
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,850
ethernet and networking, right?

54
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,888
So control systems has been
around for a long, long time,

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,030
the modern control system,

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,500
a good decade or two before
a networking connectivity.

57
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,390
And we sort of had

58
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,501
this third industrial
revolution take place,

59
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:28,100
obviously kicking in a lot of
good growth around the world,

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,120
but then we moved into this
kind of loosely connected world.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,953
And that's where you would

62
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,960
hear about SCADA, DCS environments

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,000
and looking into communications

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,370
that would reach out of your organization,

65
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,820
reach out of your networks,

66
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,500
maybe the vendors, integrators,
folks all around the world.

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,640
That was still a time when people

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,547
talked about air gaps and segmentation,

69
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:54,160
even though we do have
remote connections to folks,

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,620
even if it's just temporary limited.

71
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,440
A lot of folks today talk
about ITOT convergence

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,930
as if it's coming or happening right now,

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,140
but that ITOT convergence of windows

74
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,959
and common it systems coming
into industrial environments

75
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,670
happened a decade ago.

76
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,179
Most of the communities just catching up

77
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,760
to the fact that it did.

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,810
In the same way that this
fourth industrial revolution

79
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,643
sometimes called industry 4.0.

80
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,350
Sometimes just talked about

81
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,725
in terms of digital transformation,

82
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:21,070
is actually already here.

83
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,043
It's not really here's, what's coming.

84
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,080
There's a lot of sites around the world

85
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,053
that are doing things like direct cloud

86
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,040
to sensor technologies

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,381
to try to optimize industrial processes.

88
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:33,880
It's something though that many companies

89
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,049
are getting ready to go through

90
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,880
in terms of the overall strategy.

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,637
So some of that connectivity
was here already.

92
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,599
I think COVID exacerbated that problem

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,310
where we ended up getting
hyper-connectivity pretty quickly.

94
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,970
So it put it in this in context of

95
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,500
what is digital transformation

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,920
and really what does this mean?

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,179
Well, we've always had the same equipment,

98
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,000
in fact, the same controllers,
the same control processes,

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,230
but now we're connecting it up in a way

100
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,019
that we never have before.

101
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,440
And again, I wanna hype,

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,370
I wanna focus on that
hyper-connectivity piece.

103
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,360
Cause digital transformation
can very quickly be a buzzword

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
in a variety of communities.

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,680
But what does it really mean
in the security context?

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,576
Hyper-Connectivity and again,

107
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:18,190
what's actually happening
for the companies though,

108
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,623
taking advantage of new technologies,

109
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,621
whether it's analytics,

110
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,240
looking at actually leveraging

111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,710
some forms of (indistinct) optimizations

112
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,919
and really just value around the company

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,690
and every bit of data and insight we have

114
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,820
shows that companies that are going down

115
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,790
that digital transformation journey

116
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,810
are outperforming the
companies that are not.

117
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,270
So there's a big pressure
around the boardroom

118
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,969
of what are we doing to
modernize our industrial company.

119
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,040
So let's take it a little click down

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,770
a little level, lower level

121
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,169
to explore two case studies

122
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,600
of what this can look like

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,350
so that we can start
talking about the barriers

124
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,460
and then get into how you arm yourselves

125
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,799
and take advantage of this.

126
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,960
So here I have this case
study on Georgia Power

127
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,530
and I have all the links
are on presentation.

128
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,840
So you can go take a look at them.

129
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,810
And again, any questions,

130
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,010
let me know what your
company is experiencing.

131
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,940
I'd love and chat to hear
what you're going through.

132
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,880
Does your company have a
digital transformation officer?

133
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,460
So those kinds of conversations

134
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,169
feel free to hit me up and chat,

135
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,500
but from Georgia Power,

136
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,400
one of the common challenges
in electric utilities

137
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,560
is the fact that they've
got a lot of equipment

138
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,020
dispersed all over the world.

139
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,724
Inside any given utility,
it might be regional,

140
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:31,690
but some companies are
definitely global companies

141
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,340
where you have things like transformers

142
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,645
and pull equipment or substations

143
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,229
all around geographies

144
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,060
that are difficult to reach sometimes.

145
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,690
And when you start thinking
about transformer failures,

146
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,420
those can be super costly.

147
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,750
It's not an unsafe thing
inherently to deal with,

148
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,890
but dealing with anything
that physical process world

149
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,409
is special around failures,
fires, down poles and lines,

150
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,680
et cetera, it can absolutely
lead to injury or death.

151
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
So going out to do things like maintenance

152
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,140
can be a safety consideration as well.

153
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,780
Georgia Power ended up
doing remote monitoring

154
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
of the transformers

155
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,429
and trying to do similarly essentially

156
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,219
predictive maintenance to identify

157
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,060
when are these transformers likely to fail

158
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,130
and that allowed them to be proactive

159
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,060
in monitoring of the distribution grid.

160
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,000
So electric transmission distribution

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,640
is kind of more your local
mobile neighborhoods.

162
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,469
Going out on the distribution grid

163
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,780
and getting ahead of that.

164
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,020
So they're improving their
safety record by doing that,

165
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,950
but they're also avoiding downtime.

166
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,599
And for them, they
estimated that they saved

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,650
around $8 million just in
predictive work from that project.

168
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,883
That's pretty significant,

169
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:42,700
but it can be even more.

170
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,602
So another company,

171
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,926
which is a petrochemical
company that's not named.

172
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,025
But we do have the references now as well.

173
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,760
This Petrochemical
company dealt with a lot

174
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,060
of offshore oil and gas operations.

175
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,870
And for them, they also were very curious

176
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,390
about this possibility to do things

177
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,340
like predictive maintenance.

178
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,200
So GE got involved,

179
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,409
GE ended up working with them

180
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,930
and started looking at what they could do

181
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,060
from a predictive analytics purpose

182
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,070
of trying to identify when there's

183
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,278
gonna be downtime or issues.

184
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:14,595
They set up a variety of access

185
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,335
to that environment to get that data.

186
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,930
And based off of their work,

187
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,200
they found that they could save

188
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,300
the company $17 million a year,

189
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,910
just on the platforms
that they were working,

190
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,530
which was a 36% reduction
in unplanned downtime,

191
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,537
unplanned downtime, especially when

192
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:34,409
you start dealing with
things like offshore rigs

193
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,230
is a significant issue.

194
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,110
And so getting anything
of value towards that,

195
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,050
especially in ways that are gonna save

196
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,586
tens of millions of dollars,

197
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,380
that's pretty enticing.

198
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,780
So why wouldn't you do
digital transformation?

199
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,729
I mean, if you start looking
across what the drivers are,

200
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,030
every single discussion ends up leading

201
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,919
to operational excellence

202
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,580
and producing better goods and equipment,

203
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,960
or being able to satisfy customers better

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,530
and give them better insights.

205
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,450
Think about from an
electric grid perspective

206
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,811
of being able to have apps

207
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,409
that your users and utility customers

208
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,570
are able to fully understand
what they're consuming

209
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,020
and what they're using.

210
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,018
Everything from taking
advantage of remote workforce

211
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,469
and being able to recruit

212
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,100
in other regions and other places,

213
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,100
instead of just your local
hometown headquarters,

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,470
all these things or drivers of why folks

215
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,160
really wanna do digital transformation.

216
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,660
And it makes sense.

217
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,670
And again, just from a quick snippet,

218
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,960
as we start looking at those organizations

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,030
that do digital transformation,

220
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,500
versus those that don't,

221
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,909
you start seeing a big, big divide

222
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,339
in terms of the profitability
of those companies.

223
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,090
It is a big movement for executives

224
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,423
and for those companies.

225
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,740
But why not?

226
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,460
Well, first and foremost,

227
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,716
and probably the real
crux of the whole thing

228
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:52,290
is the industrial security sector.

229
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,390
While they have built good operations.

230
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,900
Some of the safest and
reliable operations in history

231
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,310
are happening right now

232
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,593
because the amazing work of
our engineers and operators,

233
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:04,648
but they've lagged in
putting forth strategies

234
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:07,510
and spending and resources
towards security.

235
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,770
And that's not every company.

236
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,297
I worked at a lot of companies

237
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,660
that do a ton of amazing things,

238
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,490
but as an industry,

239
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,910
they lag in spending

240
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,959
and spending gets tied pretty closely

241
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,210
to what you're actually able to do

242
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,612
and what you're forced to do.

243
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,490
Well, what I'm saying here
is a lot of the companies

244
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,479
that wanna go on a digital
transformation journey,

245
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:30,470
haven't put in the foundation for security

246
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,200
to make it a comfortable transition

247
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,350
to make it something that
they're willing to do

248
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,820
based on the perceived cyber risk.

249
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,610
And the industrials have
a lot of catching up to do

250
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,820
in terms of that process.

251
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,290
Now that doesn't mean
that just need to go out

252
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,689
and spend twice more.

253
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,950
That's not the goal,

254
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,000
but the goal of putting
a real strategy in place

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
is what we care about.

256
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,230
And that's what we're
gonna talk about again

257
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,743
in this presentation
on how to get started.

258
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,642
So I get this question all the time.

259
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:58,223
I'm a very fortunate to
be able to interact with

260
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,680
board of directors, members,

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,104
and CEOs of some of the
largest companies in the world.

262
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:05,460
I'm very privileged in that
sense that they let me come in

263
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,880
and experience their companies.

264
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,297
And I get asked a ton.

265
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:14,040
Hey, nothing's ever happened here,

266
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,540
or, yeah we have a thing,

267
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,531
but it was three or four years ago.

268
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:18,620
Why now?

269
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,390
Like the plant's been running,
the operations are good.

270
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,720
What's changed?

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,160
Why are we so concerned
about the cyber risk thing?

272
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,480
And I usually answer them not
on this ITOT advergence story

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,360
but I answer them in the fact that

274
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,740
there's another type of
convergence happening,

275
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,830
where the threats are increasing.

276
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,870
They're getting more numerous,

277
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,150
they're getting more aggressive.

278
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,880
If you're interested in a presentation

279
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
on kind of overall what's going
on on the threat landscape.

280
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,452
That was my RSA presentation

281
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:48,270
from this past year in California.

282
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,750
So it's up available online,

283
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,910
we talk through a crash override

284
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,930
the malware that targeted

285
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,979
transmission equipment in Ukraine.

286
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,570
Caused the second ever
electric power outage

287
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,403
from a cyber attack.

288
00:10:58,403 --> 00:10:59,768
The year before that was the first.

289
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,057
Talked about Trisis,

290
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,750
which was malware that
specifically targeted human life

291
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,608
and try to kill people at
a petrochemical facility.

292
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:08,890
And all these things are just the big ones

293
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,960
that people hear about.

294
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,793
There's hundreds of other cases,

295
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,870
maybe not reaching the same level,

296
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,360
but hundreds of other cases of companies

297
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,810
dealing with these things.

298
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,650
Lately we talked about Ekans Ransomware

299
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,150
and ICS specific family of ransomware.

300
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,020
We've had the Rebel-20
vulnerabilities lately

301
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,790
of vulnerabilities inside infrastructure

302
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,709
that are not going away,

303
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,020
and because folks don't even know

304
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,560
where that software stack is

305
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,949
across all of their
industrial control systems.

306
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,800
And so it's been like a 20
year problem to deal with.

307
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,520
So we have the threats actually
getting more aggressive,

308
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,810
actually learning industrial operations

309
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,469
instead of just doing IT malware things,

310
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,880
and you've got the landscape changing

311
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,830
where that hyper-connectivity story,

312
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,120
there's more pressure
on it than ever before,

313
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
more vendors and integrators and OEMs

314
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,680
and startups doing data analytics work

315
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,239
and similar to take advantage of.

316
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,400
At this convergence is one
of your world is changing

317
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,090
and the threats are changing.

318
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,660
So while you haven't moved

319
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,850
or maybe changed inside the company,

320
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,650
everything else around you has

321
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,549
and that's the real consideration.

322
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,040
So when operations and engineering

323
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,930
or maybe the plant
managers push back and go,

324
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,750
hold on, I don't know about
running remote operations.

325
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,830
I don't know about doing
a lot of this remote.

326
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,200
And when security is saying,
hey, I don't think I'm ready.

327
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,220
And I don't really know
this is a good idea,

328
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,067
there's a real reason for that.

329
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,590
And there's real risk.

330
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,590
For a good example, we track
12 different state actors

331
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:35,810
that are 12 different groups

332
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,332
that are all state actors

333
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,907
that target industrial control
environments specifically.

334
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:42,950
So not going after just IT and data,

335
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,346
but going after industrial
control environments.

336
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,820
A hundred percent of those views,

337
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,810
remote access to complete
their operations.

338
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,699
So it's completely reasonable

339
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,950
that a lot of security professionals

340
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,020
are concerned about the remote access

341
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,140
into industrial plants,

342
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,270
whether they're pivoting through

343
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,620
the enterprise IT environment

344
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,150
or taking advantage of
remote access directly

345
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,810
like VPNs and remote software
specific to vendors and OEMs.

346
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,160
And that's a big concern.

347
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,030
Heck just as last year,

348
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,089
when we looked at three new groups

349
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,290
that came online this year,

350
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,260
and again, I covered this in
the other RSA presentation,

351
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,160
all of them had that trend

352
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,030
of going after remote connectivity,

353
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,170
where Hexane was going after

354
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,750
compromising the IT environments

355
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,220
to pivot into plant operations.

356
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,518
Parasite was going after the VPNs directly

357
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,690
that are going into the organizations,

358
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,820
they'd pivot through IT if they needed to

359
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,160
more often not though they're going

360
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,930
after remote connectivity
directly at the plant.

361
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,069
And then last night specifically

362
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,020
using off the shelf tools

363
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,170
and things of the sort of

364
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,040
living on the land tactics to do it,

365
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
where traditional security methods,

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,060
aren't gonna pick that up.

367
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,569
It's more native functionality,

368
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,510
what's in the industrial environment.

369
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,720
So again that story of,
hey, there's real risk.

370
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,960
We're seeing it more and more and more.

371
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,780
And the executives are
seeing that more and more,

372
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,500
and they're coming to people going,

373
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,680
how much of this is real
and how much it isn't

374
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,209
because there's a lot of
hype and craziness out there,

375
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,404
but there's also a lot of real risk.

376
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:12,250
And the way we need to
accomplish it in OT is different.

377
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,230
A lot of the different security mechanisms

378
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,457
you're gonna try to accomplish

379
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:17,414
inside of your ICS
environment, don't make sense.

380
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:20,630
Actually, I would say
a significant portion

381
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,725
of the things that happen
in industrial security today

382
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:27,890
are copy and pasted from the
enterprise security strategy.

383
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,460
It's completely natural.

384
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,130
CSO or director of security saying,

385
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,130
look, not even hardly
resource to do my one job.

386
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm just gonna take the same strategy,

387
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,420
roll it out across my
industrial environment,

388
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,510
but it doesn't work.

389
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,150
Not only is the threats
or the threats different

390
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,069
and the systems are different

391
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,060
and similar sometimes, sometimes not,

392
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,069
but the real impact, the real difference

393
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,730
is the mission's different.

394
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,000
We're dealing with physics,

395
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,130
we're dealing with physical environments,

396
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,980
a physical process,

397
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
and that's just a
different beast altogether.

398
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,647
So deploying antivirus, isn't
gonna work across your ICS,

399
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,790
not saying don't deploy antivirus.

400
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,780
Just patching strategy
is not gonna give you

401
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,321
the same efficacy and the
same things that you need.

402
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,613
A lot of the security controls

403
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,330
and the security approach

404
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,710
in the way we implement them

405
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,001
and why we implement them

406
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,568
changes secondly intimidate.

407
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,824
So it is just completely reasonable

408
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,230
that CSOs are sitting,

409
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,310
especially right now during COVID

410
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,209
when everybody's trying
to get connected up

411
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,950
to plants and the road access

412
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,020
sitting there looking like

413
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,400
the obstacles in their organization.

414
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,680
So I wanna to sort of appeal
to all of you in security,

415
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,709
especially those of you
who are in the CSO office,

416
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,220
kind of thinking through this,

417
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,399
not to be the barrier
in your organization,

418
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,079
not to be the roadblock.

419
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,189
It is important to go on that
digital transformation journey

420
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,032
for all the reasons we
talked up front about,

421
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:47,350
but it is important to
be able to make the case

422
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,110
to the non-security executives

423
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,020
that yeah, things have changed

424
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,760
and yes, we do lag in security spending

425
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,980
and yes, we generally
don't have the resources

426
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,850
to do both an enterprise
mission that is important

427
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,309
and a completely different
mission in operation security,

428
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,357
not saying that you can't have a strategy,

429
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,750
but the implementation of that strategy

430
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,500
will end up being different

431
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,316
across those two organizations.

432
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,847
But here's the good news.

433
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,800
And this is where we can
start turning the conversation

434
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,632
and the presentation,

435
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,970
how we take advantage of this.

436
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,510
COVID has spread and sort
of sped up the mentality

437
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,500
of remote operations,

438
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,850
especially with the plant personnel.

439
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,990
Cause that could have been
a previous barrier as well.

440
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,430
A lot of plant operations folks

441
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,370
end up being great
champions and advocates.

442
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,352
Sometimes though there can be
friction between IT and OT.

443
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:39,760
There are numerous customers and folks

444
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,610
we we're talking to today

445
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,910
and just infrastructure asset owners

446
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,603
that will happily tell us

447
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,560
that the conversations around getting

448
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,489
remote access to the plant,

449
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,880
that those conversations
would have taken three years

450
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
to have to get people comfortable with.

451
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,589
And they were happening in three weeks

452
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,870
because of course people wanna prioritize

453
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,900
the safety of their personnel

454
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,140
and they don't wanna send them to site.

455
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,880
So the technology's always been there

456
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,550
to do remote operations,

457
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,750
but now there's a driver
to take advantage of it.

458
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,560
So you're actually in a unique situation.

459
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,710
I don't wanna make light of
a pretty horrible pandemic,

460
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,210
but there is a silver lining here

461
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,953
of you got people's attention,

462
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:16,290
there's an appetite for remote operations

463
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,990
in ways that they're having them before

464
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,079
for somebody else companies,

465
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,280
you're doing it now anyways,

466
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
now I need to say, look, these
things are all happening.

467
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,430
Let's do it securely.

468
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,569
Let's do it the right way.

469
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,499
So how to get started.

470
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,830
Tons of different approaches out there.

471
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,659
And I do think that what we talked about,

472
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,850
you should map it back
to various frameworks

473
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,219
in this cyber screening
framework of the United States,

474
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,040
electric community, maybe NERC CIP.

475
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,940
If you're in Europe and maybe oil and gas,

476
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,687
you're looking at 62443

477
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,639
mapping things back to standards is great.

478
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,660
It provides a common language,

479
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,480
but you don't do the standard
to implement the control.

480
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,340
You figure out what right looks like

481
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,800
and take a risk based approach

482
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,419
and then map it back for
common communications.

483
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,050
So here's what we're gonna walk through

484
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,919
for the rest of the presentation.

485
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,520
Upfront I need you to figure
out who are the stakeholders

486
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,340
for that digital transformation journey

487
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,939
you're getting ready to undertake.

488
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,112
Specifically, your company might have

489
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:12,220
a digital transformation officer.

490
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,310
That's actually pretty common
title to see these days.

491
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,780
So go figure out

492
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,290
who those people are,

493
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,720
where they are and their strategy

494
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,710
if you haven't already
been plugged into it.

495
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,900
And who are the stakeholders?

496
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,130
If you're a large company,

497
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,060
you're likely to have
different business units,

498
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,619
especially different
industrial plant operations,

499
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,730
and there's gonna be
multiple stakeholders.

500
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,970
So including yourself in that process,

501
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,100
talking about what you
can bring to help advise

502
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,870
about that secure foundation

503
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,469
and start off with educating
them on what's changed

504
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,230
and why this is important to them

505
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,930
is a great place to start.

506
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,030
Then and this is where
we'll go with the slides.

507
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,779
I'll have explainers here.

508
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:50,147
Then you need to identify your
critical sites and assets.

509
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:52,010
And I don't mean like in the network

510
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,970
and let's talk about Crown
Jewels for in the network.

511
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,300
Yeah you can do that later,

512
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,985
but I mean your actual physical sites,

513
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,970
some companies have thousands
of sites around the world,

514
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,390
some companies have 15,

515
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,150
some companies have five.

516
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,130
Whatever it is you need to know

517
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,685
which ones are the priority assets.

518
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:10,110
Then you're gonna need to
determine your risk scenarios.

519
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,010
We'll talk about how to do that.

520
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,090
Then you get to the appropriate controls.

521
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,560
Don't even worry about trying to pick out

522
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,169
the best vendor or service or training

523
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,600
or whatever before you know

524
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,290
what you're trying to defend and why.

525
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,860
So we wanna start with those requirements.

526
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,514
This is where a lot of teams mess up

527
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,370
and it's something we all know

528
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,739
but it happens to everybody.

529
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,053
Is we get in the habit of

530
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:31,326
getting really excited about the latest

531
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:34,100
and cool vendor technology
or cool partners.

532
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,110
And speaking as a vendor, like I get it.

533
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,439
And I love partnering with folks,

534
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
but slow down a little bit,

535
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,090
figure out other requirements are,

536
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,459
you got all the time in the
world to try to implement it.

537
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,146
Maybe, maybe not depends on your drivers,

538
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:47,899
but if you only get really one opportunity

539
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,680
to set the requirements correctly,

540
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,760
then we're gonna talk about
compiling all that information

541
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,940
assessing and deploying
it into our environments.

542
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,630
So first off, identifying
your critical assets.

543
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,160
Here's the one you do.

544
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,100
Your company has an understanding
of it's critical assets.

545
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,850
Sometimes it's health
and safety information.

546
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,654
Sometimes it's environmental impact.

547
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:12,700
Sometimes it's just purely
based off the profit,

548
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,690
that's getting generated
from different plants.

549
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,370
You have mechanisms,
non-security mechanisms

550
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,113
in that company to go full from.

551
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,360
Look at your business continuity plans,

552
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,805
look at your disaster recovery plans.

553
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,107
Figure out what the
most critical sites are

554
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:27,610
and understand the drivers

555
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,840
kind of come up with your own formula.

556
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,870
Well, one point for profitability,

557
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,949
one point for safety, one point,

558
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,815
come up with a formula that works for you

559
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,400
and go from start to finish

560
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,815
on those most critical
to least critical assets.

561
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,680
If you're really dealing in thousands,

562
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,382
you might wanna break it up a little bit,

563
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:45,120
but for most of you, it's gonna be

564
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,118
in the tens dozens to hundreds.

565
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,937
And you can quite literally
get the one to a hundredth list

566
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,361
of what are the most critical

567
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,603
to least critical physical sites.

568
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,033
This is something that
you then present back,

569
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,746
especially those digital
transformation folks

570
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,450
and the folks that are the stakeholders.

571
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,283
And he asks the question,

572
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,882
hey, across this list, is this,

573
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:06,050
does this actually make sense to you

574
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,919
in terms of what you see
as our critical sites?

575
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,810
Here's our math.

576
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,450
Here's what kind of what went into it.

577
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,724
And what I want you to look for

578
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:16,159
is understanding buy-in from
the non-security executives

579
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,000
that, yeah, this is the
direction one should go.

580
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,740
And hopefully those that are working

581
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,610
on digital transformation can identify.

582
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,434
Oh, actually plant three is next up for us

583
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:29,220
on the digital transformation journey.

584
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,700
So maybe that's a higher priority now

585
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,690
it's plant two instead of plant three.

586
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,840
So you kind of let them have some buy-in.

587
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,810
Next you're gonna to
develop your scenarios.

588
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,510
Now went to paper of the
Sans Institute years ago,

589
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,590
looking at different ways
to come up with hypotheses

590
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,889
around threat hunting,

591
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,917
but remove the threat hunting discussion.

592
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,870
And it's the same way to
come up with hypotheses

593
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,373
around different risks scenarios.

594
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,160
Intelligence driven a pretty
easy one to get your handle on.

595
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,219
This is what scenarios
have we seen before.

596
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:56,123
If I'm in the petrochemical industry,

597
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,210
I better have a plan and understand

598
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,537
how Trisis and kind of the
Eczema time story is gonna go.

599
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:02,540
If I'm in the electric power sector,

600
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,070
I really better have familiarity

601
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,513
with what happened in Ukraine.

602
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:07,800
Manufacturing really better

603
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,322
be good with things like NotPetya.

604
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:10,429
Someone will come up

605
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,803
with this Intel driven
scenario step-By-Step.

606
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:14,240
I can also come up with scenarios

607
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,010
that are situational awareness based

608
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,633
that might be geopolitical or economic.

609
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:20,540
But it also could be consequence driven

610
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,210
situational awareness also
means going into those plants

611
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,700
and understanding, hey,

612
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,942
what does wrong look like anyways,

613
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,277
this is where you can partner
with engineering operations

614
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:31,849
and say, look, forget
what we know has happened.

615
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,020
What could happen terrifies you.

616
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,680
You map those out.

617
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,672
Then there's always that
aspect of domain expertise,

618
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,370
where the folks in your
team maybe know things

619
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,110
or have seen things before

620
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,750
can't quite put their finger on it,

621
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,280
but they can point you to areas

622
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,530
that they're concerned about.

623
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,410
I would start with intel-driven,

624
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,340
then go to situational awareness

625
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,750
and usually let domain expertise

626
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,270
kind of flow in a magical along.

627
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,453
From there I want you
to literally map it out

628
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,560
and especially on the industrial side,

629
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,990
use the ICS Cyber Kill Chain

630
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,780
against Sans paper link there for you.

631
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,494
And the sliding scale is cybersecurity.

632
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:05,830
Again, they'll be there link for you.

633
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,620
And this is where you're gonna
start identifying controls.

634
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,949
You're gonna figure out

635
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,760
every step that went into those attacks.

636
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,980
Those remember there's no such thing

637
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,960
as a unknown unknown attack.

638
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,660
There's no such thing as a novel attack.

639
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,220
There might be a novel step,
but not a whole novel attack.

640
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,980
And there's no such thing as

641
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,640
sort of a cyber speed,
whatever night and day attack.

642
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,900
Now there's steps and
emissary (indistinct).

643
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,860
So map out each of those steps,

644
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,303
it's not about malware, it's
not about vulnerabilities,

645
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:33,910
it's about the steps the emissary took.

646
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,220
Then overlay your architecture controls

647
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,710
your passive defenses,

648
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,700
which would be things
like technology choices

649
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,550
or tools that are helping you

650
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,730
and active defense,

651
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,470
which is the human getting involved

652
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,999
like hunting an incidence
response and proactive work.

653
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,240
Figure out what you have today

654
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,190
and what you'd recommend based

655
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,100
on what you're seeing in this scenario.

656
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,379
What you're trying to get to

657
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,240
is an ability to take advantage

658
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,310
of what you've already
purchased or bought or have,

659
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,659
or having resources on staff,

660
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,866
while also lining up.

661
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,529
Well in a perfect world,

662
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:07,247
the best control for this step

663
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,790
would be this at the architecture level,

664
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,960
this at the passive event,
this at active events.

665
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,690
So we take the eczema time case,

666
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,845
which was the compromise of
the petrochemical facility

667
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,560
and then deployment of the Trisis malware.

668
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,580
We might say, hey, stage to two,

669
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,585
execute ICS attack phase

670
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,290
from an architecture,

671
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,408
we want a segmentation of
our safety instrument systems

672
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:28,050
from passive defense.

673
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,280
We want detection capabilities

674
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,530
that actually understand the ICS protocols

675
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,677
because the adversary was
taking advantage of those.

676
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:35,073
And from an active defense perspective,

677
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,060
we want another inside responders

678
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,649
can train inside of an environment

679
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,660
that's compromised safety.

680
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,080
So this is gonna start
forming the controls list

681
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,280
of not only what we have,

682
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,720
but what we want across
all your scenarios.

683
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,667
You're gonna find three
or four or five controls

684
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:52,550
that are common and most impactful.

685
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,004
I'm not telling you to go do any controls,

686
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:57,750
but this is the way you find
the three or four or five

687
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,810
that are most relevant to you.

688
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,760
Then you compile, assess and deploy.

689
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,450
This is when you get into the flow

690
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,080
where you take that rank list,

691
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,300
you take the security controls

692
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,982
that you came up with across
the end to end scenarios.

693
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,420
And you go in, you think about it

694
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,040
usually with a tabletop exercise

695
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,030
and get it kicked off

696
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,247
and walk through what an
incident would look like.

697
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:19,630
And you build towards
the incident response.

698
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,680
You don't build doors that
let's architect out the network,

699
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,450
you build towards the
incidence response of,

700
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,960
what do we want this to look
like when we get compromised?

701
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,350
Then that leads you back into work.

702
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,550
Here's the detection
strategy we need for that,

703
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,480
which leads you back to,

704
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,297
well, here's the protection strategy

705
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:34,297
and the architecture strategy,

706
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,340
but I need to support those things.

707
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,699
And so you kind of start from
the end and work backwards

708
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,777
and you roll out the perfect view

709
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,921
to that top 10% of your assets.

710
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,160
I don't want you to have peanut
butter spread everything.

711
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,660
You might do a little, you
might take one or two controls

712
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,630
and do it across everything.

713
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,430
If you want like segmentation strategy

714
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,090
and an incident response plan.

715
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,240
But I want you to not go

716
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,640
through this five-year security journey,

717
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,840
where at the very end you get
everything at the same level,

718
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,136
cause what a bad time,

719
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:04,990
if you get compromised and
you tell your executives,

720
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,010
oh, we knew plant number five was

721
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,129
the number one critical
facility in our company,

722
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,808
we just waited to year five though,

723
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,710
so that we can get to
the last critical side

724
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,543
at the same time.

725
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:16,741
Like no, start with the top 10%.

726
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,500
Your mileage will vary

727
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,730
if you can get 15 or 20% or whatever,

728
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,580
but it's gonna be based
on a security discussion

729
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,776
with what your resources are.

730
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:25,230
And that can also go back and say,

731
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,583
hey, we can only get to plant 15.

732
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,710
We can only get to plant 15

733
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,880
if you want us to get the plant 16, 17, 18

734
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,910
with these controls,

735
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,314
here's the cost of the plan.

736
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,580
And this is where you
can get those resources.

737
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,330
So if your work is validated, right?

738
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,283
If you're doing well and you have that 10%

739
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,939
that you deploy out soon
ago, this is working.

740
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,200
This is what security looks like

741
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
when done well here.

742
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,770
Then you go and break everything else out

743
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,900
in these B or C class assets.

744
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,090
And what I mean by that is

745
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,770
your A-class assets
are your most critical.

746
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,050
Then it's whatever resources

747
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,947
you can use for the next
critical set of assets

748
00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:01,129
and then it's everything else.

749
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,780
And that next, that sort of

750
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,181
tops critical assets A-class assets.

751
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:08,320
Maybe you do all five scenarios.

752
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,330
The B class asset,

753
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,470
maybe only have controls

754
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,680
as it relates to one or two scenarios.

755
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,940
And then your C class assets.

756
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,740
Again, your maybe it's just
the very common controls

757
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,290
across everyone like that
segmentation strategy.

758
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,133
What you're ultimately getting into

759
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,530
is an ability to have good KPIs

760
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,430
about how you're moving C
class assets to the B class.

761
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,500
You're getting good visibility of actually

762
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,080
your risk across the organization

763
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,350
and how you can deal with scenarios.

764
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,879
Not we're good on fishing

765
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,110
and here's 5,000 scans
against the firewall

766
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,189
we report up to the executives.

767
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,560
Nobody wants those metrics,

768
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,600
but now you can say, look,

769
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,105
as you go along your digital
transformation journey,

770
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:45,643
here's the kind of scenarios
that actually happened.

771
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,540
Then we have coverage across protection

772
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,280
detection and response.

773
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,846
We now have a real investible strategy

774
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,490
and a foundation to allow you

775
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,709
to go do that digital
transformation journey.

776
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,420
That's gonna drive conversations.

777
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,230
And what I also love about this

778
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,660
is that create storyboards,

779
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,200
not here's an exploit,

780
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,290
but here's the story of the adversary

781
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,639
and here's our story paired up against it,

782
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,690
and here's how we think we would fare.

783
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,769
That storyboard way of communication

784
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,560
is a very effective way

785
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,463
to talk to a non-security
executives and boards.

786
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,051
Boards and executives
are really, really smart.

787
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:23,360
They may not deal with a
lot of the security stuff

788
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,193
on a day to day basis,

789
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,370
but that storytelling,

790
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,949
that art of storytelling

791
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,783
is something that I don't think

792
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:30,472
we've take advantage of enough
in information security.

793
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:32,370
We talk too much about metrics

794
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,935
and not enough about here's
what I'm trying to tell you.

795
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,700
So that's a good way
to put it all together.

796
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,850
So in wrapping this up

797
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,663
and tying it back into the
digital transformation story.

798
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:42,825
what is this gonna mean
for your organization?

799
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:45,570
Number one, your world is changing,

800
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,797
your threats are changing.

801
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:48,200
Number two, there's

802
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,060
a great digital transformation opportunity

803
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,649
in front of us your organizations.

804
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,140
And some of you just
really sped up that journey

805
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,310
with that hyper-Connectivity

806
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,752
that's coming because of the pandemic.

807
00:28:56,752 --> 00:29:00,302
So first seven days after
the conference, rest,

808
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,399
even as a virtual conference,

809
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,646
remember your mental health.

810
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:06,030
Virtual conferences are
great and wonderful,

811
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,874
don't get me wrong,

812
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:08,857
but there's still a lot
going on in the world.

813
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:11,090
And you gotta recognize
your own body break.

814
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,110
Seven to 30 days, go figure out

815
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,765
who those stakeholders
are in the organization

816
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,090
that are dealing with
digital transformation.

817
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,809
Try to identify them, get to know them,

818
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,532
really get familiar with them.

819
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,438
That 30 to 60 day period,

820
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,638
develop that critical site list,

821
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,327
develop those risks scenarios,

822
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:29,670
figure out what do we care about?

823
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,760
What do we care about
inside our organization?

824
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,829
Put that list together.

825
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:36,467
Across the 60 to 120 day
period following the conference

826
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:39,248
and safety permitting given the pandemic,

827
00:29:39,248 --> 00:29:41,600
go and do a self assessment again

828
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,872
some of your most critical sites.

829
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,586
Just see what you have today

830
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,560
and how your thoughts are lining up

831
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,820
with where you wanna go,

832
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,015
versus a couple of those critical sites.

833
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:52,648
Also see and do an audit of
those remote connectivity,

834
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:55,141
because a lot of that exists
there today, guaranteed.

835
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:59,470
Then that 120 to 180 day period,

836
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,410
roll out the security for that A class.

837
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,655
The end, you're gonna be
a much better organization

838
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:05,728
ready for that digital
transformation journey.

839
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,303
Thank you very much.
