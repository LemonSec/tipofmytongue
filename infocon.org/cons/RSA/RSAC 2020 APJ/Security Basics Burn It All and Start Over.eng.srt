00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,370
- Hello and welcome to Security Basics,

8
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:20,200
I'd now like to turn
it over to John Strand

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,343
for the presentation.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,923
- Thank you so much.

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,755
I appreciate it.

12
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:26,850
And this is a quick presentation

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,360
that you kind of feel in the
industry for quite some time.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,939
But I think it's hard for some people

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,890
to identify exactly what the problem is.

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,110
And the problem is that in security,

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,930
we're being told what
actually should be done.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,810
And there's a lot of
very, very solid questions

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,460
about whether or not what
we're doing actually works.

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,270
So I talk a lot about loops.

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,050
We get into bad traditions

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
of doing the exact same thing
again and again and again

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,530
and we constantly get these questions.

24
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,140
Anytime you're working in security,

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,700
What is the best data loss prevention?

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,900
What is the best antivirus?

27
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,570
What is the best threat intel feed?

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,960
What is the best firewall?

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,430
And these get into these
patterns and chiasms

30
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,850
of us doing the exact same
thing again and again and again,

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,059
and somehow expecting different results

32
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,400
in that overall process.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,570
And that's a quote that's generally

34
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,880
attributed to Albert Einstein

35
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,610
and that's the definition of insanity.

36
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,580
So in this presentation,

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,413
I want to walk through

38
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,670
what are some things you organizations

39
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,253
should actually be focusing on

40
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,270
if you want to stop an attacker

41
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,289
from actually breaking in?

42
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,340
Now, this isn't meant to be exhaustive.

43
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,550
This is just my quick 30 minute overview

44
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,780
of what I think people
shouldn't be focused on.

45
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,580
There's still all the standard motherhood

46
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,649
in apple pie type things
that you should be doing.

47
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,110
But these are the big ones.

48
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,429
And I'm going to start off
with the biggest, passwords.

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,170
Whenever it comes to passwords,

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,800
we have tremendous issues
in the industry as a whole

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,410
in understanding what the
effect of strong passwords are

52
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,130
and actually stopping attackers.

53
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,800
Unfortunately, whenever we're looking

54
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,399
at password complexity,

55
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,230
many organizations have requirements

56
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
such as greater than eight characters.

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,210
Upper, lowercase, alpha,
numeric, no dictionary word.

58
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,769
And if that's your password
policy, it's full of fail.

59
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,009
It's very, very difficult to actually

60
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,820
have a secure organization

61
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,350
with that password complexity policy.

62
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,810
You cannot fix this in many
organizations because politics.

63
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,090
And people say well, compliance.

64
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,630
I'm going to blame PCI for this.

65
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,540
PCI says the minimum password
requirements are seven.

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,070
And they do that for a
lot of legacy systems

67
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,049
and reverse compatibility but
it's incredibly problematic

68
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,210
especially if an organization's
trying to meet the minimum.

69
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,520
So let me give an example

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,100
as far as why meeting
minimum is so problematic.

71
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,820
This is a slide that I
present on all the time.

72
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,010
It's the NIST Greenbook from 1985.

73
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,690
So I want you to take a couple of seconds

74
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,210
and I want you to think a little bit

75
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,750
about what were you doing in 1985?

76
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,550
Some of you that are at this session,

77
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,130
probably weren't even alive yet.

78
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,870
Some of you were just very small children

79
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,340
and some of you had boom boxes and Furbies

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,510
and what do they call them Teddy rub skins

81
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,010
and all these different things.

82
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,260
So kind of mentally setting that stage.

83
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,350
But if we look at the password
complexity requirements

84
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,920
from the NIST Greenboo.

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,410
In 1985, they have this paragraph .

86
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,820
It says L is set for six
months and 12 months.

87
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,370
P is set for one in one million.

88
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,050
And that's an acceptable probability

89
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,790
for guessing a password and R

90
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,489
is set for 8.5 guesses per minute.

91
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,070
And it says at a guests rate
of 8.5 guesses per minute.

92
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,070
The guests rate possible
with a 300 baud modem.

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,780
The password change
policy for an organization

94
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,632
with an eight character password
is once every six months.

95
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,500
And then it comes with this recommendation

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,930
that says how long our
passwords should be,

97
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,680
and you have, how long it's going to be

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,420
in a month on the left hand side

99
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,940
and then how many characters?

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,950
And it says eight or nine password

101
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,260
or eight or nine characters
for that password.

102
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,310
This is a password complexity
document from 1985.

103
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,210
And unfortunately,

104
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,210
many organizations never
progressed beyond this.

105
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,330
So we need to find a way
that we can start progressing

106
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,591
beyond these core fundamentals

107
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:13,550
that we get from many compliance documents

108
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,459
and many of the
conventional wisdom cedars,

109
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,060
and the industry telling us what should

110
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,800
and should not be doing.

111
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,250
Another example is antivirus.

112
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,470
If you're looking at
traditional antivirus,

113
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,950
there are a number of different ways

114
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,159
to actually bypass these different tools

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,620
that we rely on every single day.

116
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,190
It's very easy to bypass things

117
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,480
like antivirus, data loss
prevention, firewalls,

118
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,580
and it's a lot of smoke and mirrors

119
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,669
on how you can actually successfully

120
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,400
implement these things
in your organization.

121
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,349
And that's driven by many vendors

122
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,970
who like to put forth the narrative

123
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,970
that they are finally the silver bullet,

124
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,480
that if you're just running their product,

125
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,680
then you're going to be able to be secure

126
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,323
against any level of an attacker

127
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:56,609
that will be targeting your organization.

128
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,536
And I want to make it very
clear that, that is not true.

129
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:01,960
Every year at Black Hills
information security,

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,200
we do a presentation called
sacred cash cow tipping,

131
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,099
where we go through all
the major endpoint vendors,

132
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,910
and we bypass those vendors

133
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,740
usually the night before the presentation.

134
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,520
And we take, usually it's
like the top 10 or 15.

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,740
And we come up with bypass techniques.

136
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,927
And we have previous bypass
techniques and previous sessions

137
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,930
that we've archived on a number
of our different websites.

138
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,650
But if you're running
any of these products,

139
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,570
whether it's a next gen product,

140
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,969
if you're running something
like silence, or crowd strike,

141
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,727
or any of these other
tools, they're great tools.

142
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:38,727
But you need to understand
that they can be bypassed.

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,220
And if you understand this,

144
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,200
this actually creates a fundamental shift

145
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,050
in your thinking on computer security.

146
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,010
Because if you're just
relying on a vendor,

147
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,099
one single vendor on the
endpoint to keep you secure,

148
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
you're going to be running into trouble,

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,170
because that particular tool can in fact,

150
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,440
be bypassed relatively easily as well.

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,530
So if we're going to move forward,

152
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,719
we need to move beyond

153
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,060
just looking at single point solutions.

154
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,370
Like antivirus data loss
prevention, firewalls,

155
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,490
threat intelligence feeds,

156
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,790
and we need to start
leaving these things behind.

157
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,170
And if we were going to put these things,

158
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,560
and we were going to change them,

159
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,910
and we're going to do it new again,

160
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,250
what would we actually do

161
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,570
that would be maybe a change on a theme,

162
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,890
not completely changing
everything that we're doing,

163
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,030
but trying to change
things up a little bit.

164
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,869
So we can get out of these bad
loops and these bad patterns.

165
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,930
So I'm going to start with some things

166
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,590
that are relatively unpopular.

167
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,919
Let's start with Internet White Listing.

168
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,360
Now anytime I mentioned
Internet White Listing,

169
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,200
it's very common for people
to pull out the pitchforks

170
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,270
and the torches and the
angry mob that you see here.

171
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,103
And they'll say yo,

172
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,510
your presentation is bad
and you should feel bad.

173
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,150
However, I want you to take
a couple of steps back.

174
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,830
Internet blacklisting will not work ever.

175
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,140
The only thing that it does,

176
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,650
is it shows that an organization

177
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,099
is exercising due diligence

178
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,920
to stop their people from
going to bad websites

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,260
while at work for actually stopping

180
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,914
legitimate attackers, targeted attackers,

181
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:09,180
standard blacklist is next to worthless.

182
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,210
And we know this because we do anywhere

183
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,060
between 450 to 550 security
assessments per year.

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,850
And the organizations that are just

185
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,893
using traditional blacklist techniques

186
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,119
are very, very easy to break into.

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,870
Specifically, you're going to want to look

188
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,830
at the uncategorized list.

189
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,469
Now, the uncategorized list
might have different names

190
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,660
for your web application proxy vendor

191
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,130
that you're actually using.

192
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,719
And the uncategorized means
that your web proxy vendor

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,740
has never seen this website.

194
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,550
They haven't categorized
it as a news website,

195
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,490
a shopping website, a
social media website,

196
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,280
they've never seen it.

197
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,299
And I want to make it very
clear that a force point

198
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,913
or Cisco or somebody
that's a very large vendor

199
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,610
has never seen a website.

200
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,460
That has a website you do not want

201
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,900
your user population going to.

202
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,777
And if you uncheck that,

203
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:03,360
and you don't allow your users

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,583
to go to the uncategorized websites,

205
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,850
you can allow them to go to
the standard news websites

206
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,890
and the shopping websites
they would go to,

207
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,370
but as soon as you start
restricting uncategorized,

208
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,120
it makes it more difficult for an attacker

209
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,170
to actually break into your organization.

210
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,250
Yes, you can do this.

211
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,120
Trust me, it's not that hard.

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,700
And the vast majority of the sites

213
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,229
that fall into uncategorized,
once again are not websites

214
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,800
that you ever want your
user population to go to.

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
And this is not a new idea.

216
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,959
In fact, Marcus Ranum,

217
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,743
was talking about this
13 or over 13 years ago,

218
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,270
he was talking about a numerating badness

219
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,490
is a dumb idea in computer security.

220
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,760
It was not smart then and
it is still not smart today.

221
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
We need to get away from dealing

222
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,010
with traditional blacklist technologies.

223
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,810
So let's play a game.

224
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,310
If we're going to look at this

225
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,170
as kind of a thought exercise,

226
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,270
how many websites do your legitimate users

227
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,920
are legitimate websites do users go to?

228
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
They go to 200? Say 500, a 1000, 2000?

229
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,260
Find out.

230
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,300
On your day to day basis,

231
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,839
you're going to find out
that the vast majority

232
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,190
of your user population is actually going

233
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,395
to the exact same
websites again, and again.

234
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:21,720
Human beings are definitely
creatures of habit.

235
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,400
I probably have about 20 websites

236
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,319
that I visit very regularly.

237
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,980
And I don't spend a lot of time

238
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,800
just clicking on random
links, like find about

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,949
but find more about mortgages in your area

240
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,230
and they show a picture
of a cute little puppy,

241
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,040
and everyone's like, I'm
gonna click on that puppy.

242
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,630
You don't really want your users

243
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,680
doing that type of casual web surfing.

244
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,760
But if you look at where your users

245
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,580
are going for legitimate websites,

246
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,870
it's not gonna be very many.

247
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,100
And let's say hypothetically,

248
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,190
that you just allowed users to go to them,

249
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,631
like you popped up something and it said,

250
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:54,464
hey, you're going to a website?

251
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,297
I haven't seen it before.

252
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,355
Are you sure you want to go, yes or no?

253
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,470
They click yes.

254
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,400
Even if you allow the
ending to run the asylum,

255
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,870
you would still be far more secure

256
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,800
than a blacklist approach.

257
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,221
Why? Because attackers will
take advantage of websites.

258
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:11,940
They'll try to create
websites that look legitimate.

259
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,650
They're going to try to set up
command and control websites

260
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,650
with names that you know will
blend in on an organization.

261
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,209
And we can actually take advantage

262
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,060
of those to gain access
to your environment.

263
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,690
But if you're just restricting
it to where people go,

264
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,942
or you're shutting off on
categorized once again,

265
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:32,460
it drastically reduces your
overall exposure to attack.

266
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,560
For filtering, here's
just a quick example.

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,359
We have categories like adware, alcohol,

268
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
anonymizer, art, gaming,

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,740
but here's the big one right here

270
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,380
that says uncategorized in
the lower right hand corner.

271
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,770
You want to make sure that your users

272
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,770
can't go to the uncategorized
website category.

273
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,089
So let's move on to something else

274
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,030
that people get really uncomfortable with.

275
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,630
Application White Listing.

276
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,020
This is another category
of security implementation

277
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,800
that people just run away from screaming.

278
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,531
And they run from it screaming
because they think it's hard.

279
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:11,290
And they believe it to be hard
because of one simple thing.

280
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,949
Because they believe that
application white listing

281
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,700
is exclusively about
filtering on file hashes

282
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,150
We're going to go through and identify

283
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,500
every single application

284
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
and every single dynamic link library,

285
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,960
every shared object library

286
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,140
and every single system
on your environment.

287
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,795
And you're only going
to allow those through

288
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,955
and only going to allow those to execute.

289
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:35,560
Well, you could do it that way.

290
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,250
But there's actually better
ways to go about doing it.

291
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,620
In fact, one of the ways
I'm going to show you

292
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,880
on the next slide is
actually fairly simple

293
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,749
to implement as well.

294
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,780
So instead of getting away
from this binary viewer,

295
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,000
we have to do it this one way with hashes.

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,890
We can open it up a little bit.

297
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,720
We can actually do this based on directory

298
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,080
which is what I'm going to show you.

299
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,180
And you're going to have people

300
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,430
in the security community they'll say,

301
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,339
Well, I can bypass
application white listing

302
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,810
if you're allowing it by directory.

303
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,199
Yeah, they probably could.

304
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,080
But it is far more difficult

305
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,640
than just allowing everything
to execute on your system.

306
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,016
So let me show you.

307
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,890
So here's the default rules

308
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,780
that Windows 10 creates an app locker.

309
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,870
Within app locker, the default rules

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,347
will be everyone can
execute all the programs.

311
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,180
You can see it here,

312
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,599
it says Program Files.

313
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,180
And if you have older systems,

314
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,300
that can be Program Files, x86.

315
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,020
Everyone can execute all the
files in the windows directory.

316
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,170
That's where your operating
system files exist.

317
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,300
And then the administrator

318
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,819
can execute anything
anywhere that they want.

319
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,040
Turns out that this
particular set of restrictions

320
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,209
just on directory is incredibly difficult

321
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,770
for attackers to get past.

322
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,880
Now there are techniques
like ASR evil great attacks,

323
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,610
actually exploiting specific applications

324
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,580
and the vulnerabilities.

325
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,950
But your drive by downloads
become far more difficult

326
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,530
because they're going to try to land

327
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,410
and execute and temporary folders

328
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,360
and temporary folders

329
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,490
like temporary Internet folders as well.

330
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,400
This is the easiest way
to implement application

331
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,449
white listing or allow listing

332
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,640
as some people are calling it.

333
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,220
I'm an advocate of that as well.

334
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,490
This is a way that we
can actually do that.

335
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,490
And we can implement it in
a way as far as baby steps.

336
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,600
We implement allow listing on directories.

337
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,990
And as we get better, maybe we can move up

338
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,700
to digital code signing certificates

339
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,320
and publisher verification.

340
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,000
We don't have to jump straight
into validation of hashes.

341
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,390
And ultimately, whenever
we're looking at security,

342
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,630
it's all about architecture.

343
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,720
If you look at the history

344
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,670
of structural engineering
and architecture,

345
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,800
it has a history of failure.

346
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,599
It has a history of understanding

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,250
the failure points for
every single component

348
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,900
that you put into an architecture.

349
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,050
Every beam, every column, every door,

350
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,469
everything has a failure point.

351
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,090
And structural engineers

352
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,660
design their architectures in such a way

353
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,370
that there's overlapping support

354
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,600
that doesn't create
failure in just one place.

355
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,030
We have failure points,
we develop mitigations,

356
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,500
we identify weaknesses
and we develop mitigations

357
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,470
for those weaknesses.

358
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,730
And we have that overlapping
field of visibility

359
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,340
and that overlapping field
of structural support

360
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,100
and things can get better.

361
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,190
Let's take a couple of seconds.

362
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's talk about compliance.

363
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,630
James and Kelly Trollope
on enclave security

364
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,370
are the main people behind
the 20 critical controls.

365
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,498
And they have some amazing spreadsheets

366
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:25,790
that will help you implement
the 20 critical controls

367
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,730
and do it in an easy way.

368
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,430
So if you want to just google
enclave and audit scripts,

369
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,150
audit scripts 20 critical controls,

370
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,699
and they have things like
master mapping documents

371
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,540
that will map the 20 critical controls

372
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,390
to every single audit framework
on the face of the planet.

373
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,569
The reason why this is
in this presentation,

374
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,130
is I run into organizations

375
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,920
all the time that have five
or six audit frameworks

376
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,589
that they have to be in compliance with

377
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,370
and they go crazy trying
to keep them up to date.

378
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,790
With the 20 critical controls,

379
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,579
we created these years
ago at the Sans Institute.

380
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,520
We wanted to create a Rosetta Stone

381
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,750
and that's really what
James and Kelly have done.

382
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,880
So you can map to the
20 critical controls,

383
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,720
and then it automatically maps
to all the other frameworks.

384
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,240
So check that out.

385
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,290
Speaking of mapping,

386
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,849
the Mitre attack technique
matrix is monstrous.

387
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,100
Because now we're starting

388
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,400
to develop a taxonomy
of what attackers do.

389
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,480
And what I recommend that people
do is do threat emulation.

390
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,230
If you look at vulnerability assessments,

391
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,940
many times vulnerability assessments

392
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,570
will only hit like two squares

393
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,180
out of the entire Mitre
attack technique matrix.

394
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,670
When an attacker gains
access to your environment,

395
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,050
they're going to do all kinds of things

396
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,260
like password spraying, lateral movement,

397
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,550
they're going to try to execute
code on a remote systems

398
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,170
and pull data out of the environment.

399
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,569
And with the Mitre
attack technique matrix,

400
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,840
you have the ability to look

401
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,910
at what you can actually
prevent in your environment.

402
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,870
And if you do emulation
with tools like Caldera,

403
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,620
or tools like Atomic Red Team,

404
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,410
or commercial tools like size

405
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,550
which makes it very easy to execute,

406
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,609
you can actually start emulating

407
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,220
what a real attacker would do.

408
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,960
And all the time
techniques that an attacker

409
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,120
would run through,

410
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,190
and you can start doing a gap analysis

411
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,880
and so far as what your
organization can detect.

412
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,262
So check those tools out.

413
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:14,083
Firewalls, another
semi-controversial thing.

414
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,870
Why is it that your computers

415
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,930
are more secure at a coffee
shop than they are at work?

416
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,939
You see, whenever you go to a coffee shop,

417
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,300
your computer recognizes

418
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,370
that it's in unsecured open network.

419
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,840
So it throws this firewall up,

420
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,290
and it doesn't trust any of
the other computer systems

421
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,660
in that coffee shop.

422
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,500
But whenever it comes
to work, it's just like,

423
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,450
ah, shut the firewall off
anyone can connect to me.

424
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,450
You need to start treating
your internal network

425
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,330
as hostile because it is hostile.

426
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,870
There is no good reason at all

427
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,120
for all of your workstations
to talk to each other ever.

428
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,740
Let me explain.

429
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,690
So if you look at your standard exploit,

430
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,120
the attacker delivers
a client side exploit

431
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
or a drive by download and compromises

432
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,630
one computer system on the
inside of the environment.

433
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,530
Then an attacker or a pen tester

434
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,420
is going to move laterally

435
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,790
to a whole bunch of other workstations.

436
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,420
We do this because we take our credentials

437
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,599
and move from system to system to system.

438
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,790
And we do this specifically,

439
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,720
because we're trying
to escalate privileges

440
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,569
to get the main administrator.

441
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,609
So I'll move with psexec, pass-the-token,

442
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,869
remote desktop, pass-the-hash

443
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,750
and the whole goal of me doing this is,

444
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,760
is to gain access to those systems

445
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,510
to try to take over the entire domain.

446
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,730
And most of the time,

447
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,830
organizations are not able to detect

448
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,320
this type of lateral
movement unfortunately.

449
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,060
However, if you treat
your internal network

450
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,379
as hostile once again, because it is,

451
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,670
then it makes that lateral movement

452
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,560
far more difficult for the attacker.

453
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,179
They'll gain access to a system

454
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,060
and maybe they're locked into
one specific business unit.

455
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,179
Or maybe you have your
host based firewalls

456
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,320
enabled in your environment

457
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,179
or maybe your antivirus

458
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,960
which has a firewall you
can remotely manage that.

459
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,730
You can put on a number of rules

460
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,980
on your firewall that say,

461
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,970
your workstations can talk to servers,

462
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,090
your server subnets, helped us subnets,

463
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,919
administrator subnets
can talk to workstations.

464
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,750
But workstations cannot
ever talk to each other.

465
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,610
That's the type of firewall rules

466
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,620
that that we need to
have in our environment.

467
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,469
Because if we do that,
some magical things occur.

468
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,960
As soon as we gain access
to that one system,

469
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,403
as soon as we start doing
lateral movement with psexec,

470
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:30,046
past-the-token, WMI, remote desktop,

471
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:33,510
all those firewalls are
protecting those systems.

472
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,600
Not only are they
protecting those systems,

473
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,340
but they are also serving

474
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,330
as points of detection
of that lateral movement.

475
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,429
So if we tie this back to the
Mitre attack technique matrix,

476
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,990
there's an entire column
of lateral movement.

477
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,770
This would deny the attacker,

478
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,860
the vast majority of those techniques

479
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,459
that deal with lateral movement.

480
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,270
Now, once again going back to passwords,

481
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,060
we started with that as
one of the key things.

482
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,409
The only thing that matters

483
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,360
when you're dealing with
passwords is length.

484
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,020
You'll get into these long conversations

485
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,770
of upper or lowercase,
alphanumeric, special characters,

486
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,170
don't allow dictionary words,

487
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,990
don't allow this don't allow that.

488
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,530
The only thing that
matters is length folks.

489
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,442
Make your password 16 characters long,

490
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:16,550
allow people to use dictionary words,

491
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,470
but keep the upper, lower, special case,

492
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,830
numeric numbers,

493
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,610
and your passwords are
going to be far more secure

494
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,870
than a shorter quote unquote

495
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,889
more complicated password
that they would have in place.

496
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,020
You see, if you actually get to the point

497
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,050
where you don't allow people
to use dictionary words

498
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,419
and you're using in
requiring upper, lowercase,

499
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,130
alphanumeric, special characters,

500
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,320
your users will start keyboard patterns

501
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,169
and when they do keyboard patterns,

502
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,020
they'll actually coalesce on a
handful of keyboard patterns.

503
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,900
And you'll have like far less entropy

504
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,540
and your overall passwords

505
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,580
than if you just let people come up

506
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,287
with passphrases on their own.

507
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,800
Next up, let's talk about
two factor authentication.

508
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,526
This is one of those things

509
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:59,250
that we're starting to see
implemented in organizations.

510
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,950
I'll be it slower than we would like.

511
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,410
But two factor authentication

512
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,200
will absolutely shut down many attackers.

513
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,846
Now there are bypass techniques.

514
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,970
You can run things like Evilginx,

515
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,660
you can run things like credit king

516
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,340
to try to intercept that
two factor authentication,

517
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,970
but it will make the attack

518
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,320
far more difficult to gain
access to an environment.

519
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,590
So try to implement this.

520
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,330
It can be via SMS notification,

521
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,340
even though people say SMS notification

522
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,370
for two factor is horrible.

523
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,699
It's better than nothing.

524
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,090
You can use Google Authenticator,

525
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,209
you can use duo,

526
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,670
there's a ton of different
technologies that are out there.

527
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,884
And you might get some pushback

528
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,640
in your organization as to whether

529
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,970
or not you should do this.

530
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,390
And I would encourage
you to share the article

531
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,060
from Teen Vogue that says,

532
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,810
two factor authentication
is very important.

533
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,760
If we can't meet a security standard,

534
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,660
can we at least meet the
Teen Vogue standards?

535
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,793
And come on Teen Vogue?

536
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:54,610
Let's talk about smarter logging.

537
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,820
So if we're looking at logging,

538
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm gonna set you up a quick trick

539
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,850
that you can set up in your environment

540
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,764
that's going to detect
your next turtle assumed

541
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:02,870
compromise assessment or your pen test.

542
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,229
Here's what I want you to do.

543
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,570
I want you to create a
user in your environment,

544
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,850
give it an obvious name.

545
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,683
In this situation,

546
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:13,300
I called my user admin ADM administrator.

547
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,310
Try to be right on the nose

548
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,790
that this is an account

549
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,889
that's called the administrator account.

550
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,210
Then, I'm going to disable
all the login hours.

551
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,610
So you can't actually log
into this account ever.

552
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,399
And then you set up alerting in your SIEM.

553
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,633
That if anybody ever tries
to log into that account,

554
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,340
they will immediately generate an alert.

555
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,760
And this is what it looks like.

556
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,070
This is a tool called
domain password spray

557
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,320
but bold Bullock or daft hack.

558
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,250
It automatically pulls
down a full user list

559
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,120
of every single user
ID in your environment

560
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,030
and then attempts a single
password against that account.

561
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,870
So you can see here,

562
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,270
it says, it's password spring

563
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,060
with password of probably spring.

564
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,330
What is it 2017 in the screenshot.

565
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,413
And it's trying every single user account.

566
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:02,600
Just by simply trying to authenticate

567
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,820
to that account automatically,

568
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,570
it can generate an alert.

569
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,530
And when it does, you could do something

570
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,720
like lock that workstation down.

571
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,430
This is an amazing bit of cyber deception,

572
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,270
where you can set a tripwire

573
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,889
that will absolutely attack or not attack,

574
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,120
it will detect an adversary

575
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,600
that is attacking you very
quickly post exploitation.

576
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,230
Why? Well, we're setting this trap

577
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,530
in a place where adversaries go.

578
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,300
Password spraying is in the bag of tools

579
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,854
that almost every single attacker

580
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:34,470
uses against your environment

581
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,200
and every other environment
every single day.

582
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
And if we set this up internally,

583
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
it is one of the tricks that they use

584
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,170
to try to move laterally

585
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,200
and you'll be able to detect

586
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
that lateral movement immediately.

587
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,100
Once again, tying back to the
Mitre attack technique matrix.

588
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,820
Also, with logging use Sysmon.

589
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,320
I cannot stress enough just
how incredibly worthless

590
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,550
standard event logging actually is.

591
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,430
In fact, if you look at the
Verizon data breach report,

592
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,630
something like 1% of all the
breaches that they worked

593
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,320
were detected by their SIEM.

594
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,149
And that's because there's
no event ID that says,

595
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,810
event ID 666.

596
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,360
You've been hacked, it doesn't exist.

597
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,240
But Sysmon gives you amazing fidelity

598
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,470
for free out of the box.

599
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,580
So here's an example of a Sysmon log.

600
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,169
We have the process ID, the
executable, the full path to it,

601
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,700
the file version, the
description within that file,

602
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,040
what that product is,

603
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,320
what the name of that particular file is.

604
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,639
We also have the hashes

605
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,220
of that file that executed.

606
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,822
With this, we finally
have the level of logging

607
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:43,560
that we've always wanted
in computer security.

608
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,480
So please do me a favor,
start logging Sysmon.

609
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,600
All of your major sim
vendors will support it.

610
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
And you might get into
an argument of well,

611
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,250
would we be logging
too much at that point?

612
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,770
Look, most of what you're
logging is garbage here.

613
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,620
Another exercise.

614
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,090
I want you to look at the logs

615
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,649
that you're collecting right
now in your organization.

616
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,330
What percentage of those
logs have an alert,

617
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,129
a signature or a report
associated with them?

618
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,190
You're gonna find out that probably 95%

619
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,680
of the logs that you're
collecting have no alert,

620
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,310
have no report, have no signature,

621
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,480
you're just collecting and storing them.

622
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,170
Like some twisted hoarder

623
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,880
who has garbage all over their house

624
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,470
with long fingernails and talks to aliens.

625
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,630
So you need to get away from
being an infosec quarter.

626
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,900
Instead, you need to start
logging the right thing.

627
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,080
So log the things that matter

628
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,820
and Sysmon is absolutely
something that matters.

629
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,830
So when we're talking about
these different things,

630
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,250
it seems like it's difficult.

631
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,840
And there's this analogy

632
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,850
that people talk about all the time.

633
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,090
How do you go about eating an elephant?

634
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,480
Well, you shouldn't try to go

635
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,400
to straight implementation
right off the bat.

636
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,710
You don't want to jumps to hey,

637
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,450
we're gonna implement
carbon black everywhere.

638
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,800
We're gonna try to implement
tripwire everywhere.

639
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,090
You will see a lot of organizations

640
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,199
that try to jump to implementing

641
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,420
a full security posture of hash based

642
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,510
application low listing.

643
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,610
You see organizations
that try to jump straight

644
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,830
to do full segmentation and isolation

645
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,000
on every system in one shot,

646
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,010
take it apart piece by piece,

647
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,826
roll out your security implementation

648
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:22,260
with different networks, business units

649
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,820
and geographical locations.

650
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,860
Roll them out, start
with your security team,

651
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,240
move to the administrators,
move to help desk,

652
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,800
roll these things out
slowly in your environment.

653
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
And you're gonna have a much better time

654
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,650
implementing them as a whole.

655
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,700
Protect yourself.

656
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,350
One of the things I also recommend

657
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,187
is you need to protect yourself at home.

658
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,260
Especially whenever we're
looking at the world of COVID

659
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,690
that exists today.

660
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,140
We're many of us are in
fact now working from home,

661
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,420
and we may be accessing our
organizational resources

662
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,160
from a personal browser.

663
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,360
You have to protect yourself.

664
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,242
Look at things like Adblock Plus,

665
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:59,710
OpenDNS at home,

666
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,690
keep your systems
patched, use a passphrase.

667
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,872
Don't run strange programs.

668
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:07,780
Yes, Microsoft antivirus is just fine.

669
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,360
Never talked to anybody

670
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,679
who says they work for
Microsoft tech support.

671
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,963
But you all know that.

672
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,770
What I encourage you all to do

673
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,290
is share the simple ideas on this slide

674
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,570
with your friends and your family.

675
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,500
Share this idea with your children

676
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,800
and nieces and nephews and grandchildren.

677
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,820
So we can start getting better

678
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,320
at securing not just our
organizational assets,

679
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
but us as a whole.

680
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Because here's the deal.

681
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,370
If you look at computer security,

682
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,729
computer security is not
just a corporate problem,

683
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,900
computer security and
the problem that we have

684
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,060
is an education and awareness problem.

685
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,749
And we desperately need our education

686
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,360
and our awareness to extend far beyond

687
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,429
the boundaries of the
organizations that we work for.

688
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,310
And it has to start going
to friends and family

689
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,010
and all of you that are listening

690
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,340
and watching this video right now,

691
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,770
you are the pointy edge of the spear.

692
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,950
You are the best and brightest
in computer security.

693
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,890
And it's incumbent upon all of you

694
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,350
that are watching this video

695
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,419
to go forth and try to teach people

696
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,200
how to be secure not just at work,

697
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,020
but in their everyday lives.

698
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,637
Because if they're not secure at home,

699
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,720
they're not going to be secure
in organizations either.

700
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,183
So the apply slide moving forward.

701
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:28,280
Let's stop doing this standard
things that we've been doing.

702
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,639
The traditional defenses,
the SIEM, the AVs,

703
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,330
the standard firewalls just
on the edge of our network,

704
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,860
they get out of date quickly.

705
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,270
Let's start trying to
fix things like passwords

706
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,410
with longer links and let's move

707
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,350
to two factor authentication.

708
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,090
Let's look to what actual attackers do

709
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,980
and let's start emulating
what those actual attackers

710
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,340
do to stop those attacks.

711
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,629
Let's use Mitre, let's use Caldera.

712
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,030
Let's use slide, let's
use Atomic Red Team.

713
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,720
Improve your logging and set some traps

714
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,150
in your organization as well.

715
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,340
That's what I'm ultimately
asking all of you to do.

716
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,919
This was a quick presentation.

717
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,420
And I just want to say thank you so much

718
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,805
for sitting through this
presentation and listening.

719
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:10,040
My email is john@bhis.co.

720
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,639
I'm on Twitter because
everybody's on Twitter.

721
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,395
And yeah, even at my phone number.

722
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:15,228
If you have a question,

723
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:17,000
don't hesitate to pick
up the phone and call me.

724
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,530
So once again, I want to
say thank you very much

725
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,673
and I hope you have a
great and safe conference.
