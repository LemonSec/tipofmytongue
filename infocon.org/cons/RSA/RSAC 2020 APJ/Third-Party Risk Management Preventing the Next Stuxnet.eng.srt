00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,291
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,670
- Hello and welcome to
Third Party Risk Management:

3
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,503
Preventing the next Stuxnet.

4

8
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,010
I'd now like to turn it
over to Rafael Garcia,

9
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,060
for the presentation.

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,890
- Hi everyone, my name is Rafael Garcia

11
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,720
and today I'll be presenting
on Third Party Risk Management:

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,633
Preventing the next Stuxnet.

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,020
I've been in the
Information Technology area

14
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,893
for the last 20 years.

15
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:30,009
With the last seven years
focused in Information Security.

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,230
So one of my duties at
the company I work for,

17
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,680
is Third Party Risk Management.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,960
Something that we have
taken very seriously

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,449
and we developed this program

20
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,150
that I'll be talking to you about.

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,540
So, cyber risk.

22
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,863
What is cyber risk?

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,640
How do you define cyber risk?

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,020
We usually, always try
to minimize risk, right?

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,170
In all of our daily activities.

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,470
We don't want bad things
happening to our environment.

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,929
For instance, you know that if
you drive a car too fast or,

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,160
you are risking your life and possibly,

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,403
somebody else's life.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,040
Or you might be risking being
stopped by a police officer

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,470
and getting a speeding ticket.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,320
You minimize that risk by
driving at the allowed speed.

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,859
With a car that's in good condition

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,470
and being aware of your surroundings.

35
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,900
So, by definition, risk is the exposure

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,890
to the possibility of
loss, injury or other

37
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,109
adverse or unwelcome circumstances.

38
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,520
So risk is uncertainty, times exposure.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,270
In the digital world, as many systems are

40
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,960
connected to the internet
nowadays and our data

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,030
resides in the storage media,

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,600
either internal or external.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,000
There are many risks.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,490
And we have to have a duty
to protect the information

45
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,690
and information systems.

46
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:03,050
There are

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,240
different elements in cyber risk.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,390
There's usually the people who
access the data continuously.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,000
There are processes in
place across, to access data

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
or data systems.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,770
The infrastructure behind those systems

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,950
and external events who can vary from,

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,140
system malfunction to actors

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,359
or cyber actors

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,220
trying to access restricted data.

56
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,260
All organizations are
candidates for cyber attacks.

57
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,950
It doesn't matter how big
or small the business is.

58
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,630
The malicious actors have
different objectives.

59
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,250
A lot of times it's financial benefit.

60
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,060
But there's other

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,973
reasons behind the attacks.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,330
Black Swan events.

63
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,900
A Black Swan is an unpredictable
event that's beyond

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,620
what's normally expected of a situation.

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,560
And has potentially severe consequences.

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,230
Black Swan events are characterized

67
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,160
by their extreme rarity,
and their severe impact.

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,560
A lot of times we believe

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,250
nothing is going to happen, we're fine.

70
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,640
We might not be a business
that's on the eye's

71
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,880
or under target for attack.

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,783
We are wrong.

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,670
Some of the experts think
that most of the businesses

74
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,943
are at risk nowadays.

75
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,113
All right so, the financial services.

76
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,130
As you can see in the last few years,

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,780
cyber risk is being split
into different categories.

78
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,340
Such as data security and data compromise.

79
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,830
IT disruption, privacy,
cyber theft and cyber fraud.

80
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,353
Back in 2016, it was just cyber risk.

81
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:05,560
General idea of risk in
the information systems.

82
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,280
But then throughout the last years,

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,169
it's been split into
these different categories

84
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,950
and as the financial sector

85
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,539
has been under attack multiple times.

86
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,630
Now in the healthcare industry.

87
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,740
The healthcare industry is plagued by

88
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,830
cybersecurity-related issues.

89
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,590
These issues range from
malware that compromises

90
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,849
the integrity of systems
and privacy of patients.

91
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,510
To distribute at
denial-of-service attacks.

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,659
The DDoS attacks.

93
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,823
That disrupt facilities,
ability to provide patient care.

94
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,159
Today, IOT devices are a major risk.

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,520
As hackers can access
medical devices such as,

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,520
life support systems,
respirators, heart pacemakers.

97
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,220
So, as these devices are connected

98
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,593
to the internet or to networks,

99
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,592
those are doors that can
be opened by attackers,

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,760
where they can compromise the systems.

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,240
Now, I work in the energy sector.

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,023
So, as for the energy
sector, in the recent years,

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,700
the energy sector has come
to embrace cloud-based

104
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,863
or interconnected management
and distributed system.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,140
According to a new report
published by Deloitte,

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,690
cybersecurity threats put these
critical resources at risk.

107
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,880
Just like in other industries,
IOT devices are now

108
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,082
populating the electric grid
and they pose a big risk.

109
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,740
Also the Deloitte study
finds that cyber attacks

110
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,140
on utilities have been
steadily increasing.

111
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,659
In 2016 alone, there were 59 cyber attacks

112
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,703
on the American energy sector.

113
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,130
One of the best examples of
an attack to the power grid

114
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,770
is what happened in Ukraine,

115
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,423
with the black energy
attack in December 2015.

116
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,150
Some people believe it was the
neighbor who attacked them.

117
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:20,929
And that can happen as
easily as implanting malware

118
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,823
in their systems.

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,479
So lemme go over the cybersecurity events

120
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,183
in the last two decades.

121
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,710
All right, in cyberspace

122
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,710
a few lines of malicious code
can be written by coders,

123
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,070
the script kiddies or state actors.

124
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,650
Like in the case of Stuxnet

125
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,880
But what is the reason behind the attacks

126
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,022
with malicious code?

127
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,440
Most of the time it is economic benefit,

128
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,803
like I said before.

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,370
Or, the actors, they want to get paid

130
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,290
when information is compromised.

131
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,360
We see cases of ransomware all the time.

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
The stolen databases with
customer's information,

133
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,893
such as credit cards, social
security numbers and more.

134
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,219
Then there is the group of hacktivists,

135
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,360
whose primary objective
is to disrupt the systems

136
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,860
of an organization, as a way
to protest against things.

137
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,840
And finally, we see the
nation-sponsored attacks.

138
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,789
When the cyber armies and
intelligence services of a country

139
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,230
seek to show their
power, as it was done in

140
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,940
wars or it's been done in wars.

141
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,500
Today an entire country's power
grid can be compromised when

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,060
sophisticated malware is implanted

143
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,369
in critical infrastructured networks.

144
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,250
Same as attacks to the financial
sector that can disrupt

145
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,083
the economy of a country.

146
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,340
So usually the sophisticated attackers

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,840
target vulnerable network
systems that had been previously

148
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,493
scanned and penetrated
by these cyber actors.

149
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,530
Then they also target the
humans behind a computer.

150
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,653
We have two different groups here.

151
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,860
The careless users,

152
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,620
people who will open any email

153
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,790
or click on attachments and links,

154
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,010
without taking care or
really reading into stuff.

155
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,010
And then we have malicious
insiders, people who's

156
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,430
probably not pleased in
their jobs and they want to,

157
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,130
in a way, get back to their employers.

158
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,270
So,

159
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,480
this attackers target them, because,

160
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,960
I mean, the humans are the
ones who can open the doors

161
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,740
of this systems, right.

162
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,530
And then the last group that
we will be covering today is,

163
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,970
the vendors who
inter-connect their systems

164
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,023
to your network for procurement,
forecasting and management.

165
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,543
All right, so,

166
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,920
some of the major cyber
attacks since 2010.

167
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,093
In 2010,

168
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,820
we heard about the Stuxnet virus attacks

169
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,370
that led to the destruction
of more than a 1000

170
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,563
Iranian centrifuges and delayed
Iran's enrichment program.

171
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,650
It's believed that it was done
by the work between the US

172
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:53,163
and Israel, with some
other countries helping.

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,420
Some analysts, in retaliation to that,

174
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,680
Iran got back

175
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,613
to the US,

176
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,220
by sending this denial of

177
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,630
service attacks to the
financial institutions

178
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,330
in 2012 and 2013.

179
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,600
And then also in 2012,
it's believed that Iran

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,580
launched these attacks to
the Saudi company Aramco,

181
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,433
destroying about 30000 systems.

182
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Another big example here, in
the last decade is North Korea.

183
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,100
It's believed that North
Korea has increasingly

184
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,680
mounted cyber attacks

185
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,300
against it's neighbor, South Korea.

186
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,829
Most of these attacks
are easy to attribute

187
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,620
for three reasons.

188
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,530
First, they often come
from addresses known

189
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,689
to be used by North Korea.

190
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,600
They often occur on Korean anniversaries.

191
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,500
And they often use similar
methods and attack-code.

192
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,940
Experts believe that North
Korea launched the cyber attacks

193
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,300
to steal South Korea's war plans.

194
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,969
And they also believe that
North Korea has used the

195
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,020
cyberspace to launch increasingly
sophisticated attacks

196
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,650
to steal funds from financial institutions

197
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,193
and crypto currency
exchanges, to generate income.

198
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,083
So, Stuxnet.

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,593
What happened with Stuxnet?

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,430
Stuxnet was a malware code
running in computers that

201
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,300
controlled the industrial systems

202
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,203
at this nuclear plant in Iran.

203
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,550
In January 2010, it was discovered that

204
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,520
this centrifuges were

205
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,370
experiencing some explosions.

206
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,253
And these are the systems
used to enrich uranium.

207
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,329
This was the second time it happened,

208
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,330
because back in 2009, they
experienced the same issues.

209
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,400
So in June 2010, a group
of researches at Belarus

210
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,490
found malware codes running
in computers that controlled

211
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,913
the industrial systems at the plant.

212
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,459
So it was discovered that
earlier version of this malware

213
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,540
was already running since 2009.

214
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,530
It was running on PLCs,

215
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,150
which are Programmable Logic Controllers.

216
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,069
These are like small computers
that are physically attached

217
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,163
to industrial controlled systems.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In this case of Stuxnet,
this PLCs were manufactured

219
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,130
by this German company, Siemens.

220
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:55,602
It was the Siemens S7-4000

221
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,940
model, PLC that had this
malware running on it.

222
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,670
And what it did is,

223
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,439
it changed the speeds on the centrifuges,

224
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,653
to make them explode.

225
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,663
So,

226
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,960
how did they do it?

227
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,620
The cyber actors first obtained
information from different

228
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,620
sources to identify the
specific model of PLCs.

229
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,400
Then, once they had the
information in hand,

230
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,742
they started developing the malware.

231
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,910
Once the malware was created,

232
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,410
the attackers spent some
time in the delivery phase.

233
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,800
This is where Third Party
Risk Management is important.

234
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,800
What happened here is, that
they investigated who the

235
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,113
suppliers, contractors were.

236
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:58,640
And found a way to deliver this malware

237
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,290
through one of the third party vendors.

238
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,680
It was delivered via USB.

239
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,640
It was put on a USB drive

240
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,460
and it copied to the system, right.

241
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,310
Once it was running
there, it was very, very

242
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,890
easy for the malware to start identifying

243
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,603
everything on that network.

244
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,200
It was, I would say, some of, back then,

245
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,090
use of machine learning.

246
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,090
Because it was learning the
processes of these centrifuges

247
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,580
and then it analyzed by
the times, the speeds

248
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,580
and when they ran and all the information,

249
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,500
that once it was collected, the
malware used the information

250
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,800
to start running

251
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,969
and making the changes
necessary to make them change.

252
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,670
So, it was blowing up these centrifuges

253
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,069
and leaving no trace.

254
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,580
So it was very hard for
the nuclear plant engineers

255
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,453
to understand what was happening.

256
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,240
So, major weakness was the
lack of security control

257
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,210
for contractors and third-party vendors.

258
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,580
The attacker knew who to infect first,

259
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,530
with the help of infiltrated people

260
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,949
who obtained digital certificates.

261
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,120
And then they delivered this
malware on the USB drives.

262
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,120
The USB drives were not
sanitized or scanned before

263
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,522
they plugged them into the
industrial controlled network.

264
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,250
So, in most cases,
industrial control systems

265
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,270
are not built with security in mind.

266
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,340
And they have many, many vulnerabilities.

267
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,560
Starting with weak
authentication mechanisms.

268
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,430
So that's why it's very important that you

269
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,569
run a Third Party Risk Management
program in your company,

270
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,930
if you have this kind of,

271
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,930
either industrial control
systems or SCADA systems

272
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,950
or your health network or
financial system, right.

273
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,670
So, moving on, managing risk.

274
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,653
The cybersecurity capability model.

275
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,700
We can manage risk my reducing
uncertainty or an exposure.

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
So, if we mitigate risk

277
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,120
by reducing this exposure
of vulnerabilities

278
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,040
or exposure to opening doors

279
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,263
to these actors.

280
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,653
We can mitigate the risk and
we'll be in better shape.

281
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,100
So, the energy sector, a few years ago,

282
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,980
developed the Cyber
Capability Maturity Model.

283
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,980
It's a program that's a
public-private partnership effort

284
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,772
that was established as a
result of the Administration's

285
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:20,110
efforts to improve electricity subsector,

286
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,550
cybersecurity capabilities
and to understand

287
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,773
the cybersecurity posture of the grid.

288
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,490
It was developed at
Carnegie Mellon University.

289
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,210
And something very important
to mention here is that

290
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,340
it focuses on the implementation
of cybersecurity practices

291
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,820
associated with information technology

292
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,163
and operation technology.

293
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,010
For the last few years, they'd
been seen as separate worlds.

294
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,803
Very, very different worlds right?

295
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,230
The thing is that,

296
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,313
systems are getting
inter-connected nowadays.

297
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:06,320
The combination of these
technologies and interaction

298
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,840
of these different
technologies is happening.

299
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,409
So it's very important that all the same

300
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,500
mitigation you apply on your IT world,

301
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,643
has to be applied on the OT world.

302
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,040
The Cybersecurity
Capability Model considers

303
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,149
10 different domains.

304
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,350
And these domains include risk management,

305
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,080
asset change and configuration management,

306
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,530
identity and access management,

307
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,200
threat and vulnerability management.

308
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,880
Situational awareness, information sharing

309
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,350
and communications, event
and incidents response.

310
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,889
The supply chain and
external dependencies.

311
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,620
The workforce management

312
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,953
and cybersecurity program management.

313
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,843
So, Third Party Risk Management.

314
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,490
We have a cycle here.

315
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,170
Our Third Party Risk
Management is a process

316
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,950
in place at many companies
that deals with the planning,

317
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,480
due diligence, the contract negotiation,

318
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,890
transition execution,
continuous monitoring,

319
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,090
termination of this third parties

320
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,340
and it goes back to
planning and-so-on, right.

321
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,929
So it's a continuous cycle

322
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,320
that has to be reviewed

323
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,300
all the time.

324
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,430
And that's why it's very important,

325
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,623
you don't take your eyes off of it.

326
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,540
Building digital relationship
with third parties

327
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,590
increases exposure to
the cybersecurity world.

328
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,770
So by following the right path, IT leaders

329
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,100
can feel confident in
their approach to managing

330
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,283
the cyber risk of these new relationships.

331
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,720
All right so, vendor relationships.

332
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,663
It's very important that every company

333
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:26,010
understands that they
are part of a digital

334
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,460
inter-connected networks.

335
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,280
And these partners, vendors
and other third party

336
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,853
organizations will, sooner or later,

337
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,653
connect to your systems.

338
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,423
So what do you have to do?

339
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,810
Well you have to employ these
network security measures.

340
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,470
A lot of times it's
believed that, oh well,

341
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,340
my network is air gap.

342
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,990
Like we saw in the Stuxnet case,

343
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,823
there's not truly air gap networks.

344
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,020
Because these systems will need upgrades,

345
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,623
will need log files.

346
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,883
Futhermore upgrades and
connectivity to other systems.

347
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,773
So as the technology's evolving,

348
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,909
we'll see this air gap networks

349
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,910
not really being isolated.

350
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,690
So it's very important to have
your vendor risk assessment

351
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,630
program in place and
comply with the standards

352
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,634
that you have to comply,

353
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:32,610
to protect your critical infrastructure

354
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,163
or the infrastructure for your business.

355
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,720
Many companies don't know

356
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,193
how to initiate these programs, right.

357
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,610
And managing third party
risk and protect the value

358
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,209
of the organization could be challenging.

359
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,890
So I'm here to

360
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,570
walk you through the process

361
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,723
of developing your third
party risk management.

362
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,020
In my experience, I know that
this could be challenging.

363
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,235
Managing vendors, there's
companies that have

364
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,909
hundreds or even thousands
of different vendors

365
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,280
and they inter-connect
to the systems, right.

366
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,000
So, the first thing I would recommend is,

367
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,330
getting some tools.

368
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,449
Tools to help you move
from manual processes

369
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,113
to automated processes.

370
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,710
Then, that way you can
expand a number of vendors

371
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,560
that you can assess and you can align with

372
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,940
Enterprise Vendor Management programs.

373
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,940
So, some of the tools include like,

374
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,403
the possibility of,

375
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,040
group these vendors in
different tiers, right.

376
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,040
And also assign different
criticalities to them.

377
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,060
It is not the same, a vendor
that connects to your database,

378
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,700
than a vendor that sends you,
maybe graphic content, right.

379
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,280
So, it's very important
to assign how critical

380
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,740
your vendors are.

381
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,673
And differentiate them and
group them accordingly.

382
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,910
Then, with some of these
tools, what you can do is,

383
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,643
you can assign risk criticality.

384
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,179
You can assess the vendors,
probably by sending a

385
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,730
questionnaire to them.

386
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,030
Or following other processes.

387
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,720
And you can analyze how risky

388
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,210
each one of your vendors are, right.

389
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,570
Then you can manage these
assessments on a yearly basis

390
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,800
or semi-yearly basis.

391
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,270
And that way you continuously analyze.

392
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,260
One of the big problems
in the industry is that

393
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,197
some people analyzes a
vendor or assesses a vendor,

394
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:03,209
few years ago, they
think everything is good,

395
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,550
but things change everyday.

396
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,550
So, that vendor that was in
very good shape five years ago,

397
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,523
could be at risk today.

398
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,543
As you can see in this slide,

399
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,920
you can get all the information
with these tools on,

400
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,623
where the risk is for
each one of the vendors.

401
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,980
It can tell you if the
vendor could be a breach

402
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,700
because they haven't
patched their systems.

403
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,610
Or they have a weak anti-virus program or

404
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,570
no anti-virus at all.

405
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,689
Their firewalls are probably,

406
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,853
haven't been patched
in the last year or so.

407
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,490
So, this assessment is going to help you.

408
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,453
And these tools are going to help you,

409
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,000
over-looking at your vendors and

410
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,243
finding which one is vulnerable.

411
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,610
Some of the other tools
can provide scoring system

412
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,919
to your vendors.

413
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Something similar to
the credit score system.

414
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,710
And it's going to tell you how critical

415
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,823
or how risky your vendor is.

416
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,260
So you can combine these
two different tools.

417
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,260
The system assessment and the
score or cybersecurity score.

418
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,570
And then the combination of
those results will give you

419
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,930
the risk levels for each
one of your vendors.

420
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,810
You can also monitor

421
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,163
where your vendors are
located geographically.

422
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:50,790
And that's going to help
you in deciding what to do

423
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,200
when you read news about

424
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,163
things happening in other countries.

425
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,530
So the TPRM program.

426
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,480
Doesn't matter if you're a
small or medium, large company.

427
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,910
A lot of companies are
in their initial stages

428
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,550
of designing and launching this program.

429
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,700
Some others already have
a mature program in place.

430
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,260
But like I said, it's a cycle
and you have to review it

431
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,490
all the time and make improvements to it.

432
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,340
There's a lot of room for
continuous improvement.

433
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,699
A lot of organizations need
this continuous visibility

434
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,030
of all the third parties.

435
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,080
And we also need to report to
Executive Management, right.

436
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,120
So, by running a
comprehensive and consistent

437
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,379
third party risk management program,

438
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,560
the organizations can identify potential

439
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,750
third party vulnerabilities

440
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,053
and fairly compare
different organizations.

441
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,683
Some of the recommendations
I have for you is,

442
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,210
try to get continuously updated ratings.

443
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,350
Constant communication with vendors.

444
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:08,350
Testing environments, detect
and connect any shortcomings.

445
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,320
And if you have to, don't
be afraid to replace vendors

446
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,403
if they don't comply with
your cybersecurity standards.

447
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:20,260
You don't want to risk your company being

448
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:25,130
breached by a hacker

449
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,010
because of your vendor

450
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,549
or connectivity to your vendor.

451
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,843
Some of the goals we have is,

452
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,210
continuously monitoring
vendor performance.

453
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,930
Enforcing third party risk policies.

454
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,793
Improving vendor coverage
and monitoring capabilities.

455
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,870
We also have increase in organizational

456
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,062
management awareness and visibility.

457
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,020
Increasing accountability throughout

458
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,723
a comprehensive program.

459
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,710
We also have, we reduce compliance cost

460
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,000
both with internally and
externally by streamlining

461
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,880
these compliance activities.

462
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,620
Lowering the cost of vendor assessment.

463
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,723
And streamlining reporting
and audits report.

464
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,810
The end goal is to
prevent the next Stuxnet

465
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,253
or the next attack to your network.

466
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,954
So the action plan is,
initially you have to,

467
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:35,954
immediately after this
presentation you have to identify

468
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,480
who your critical assets
in your organizations are.

469
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,070
And your critical vendors,
people who have access to your,

470
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,889
like I said before,
like to your databases,

471
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,920
to your critical systems.

472
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Identify these vendors and
group them in different tiers.

473
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,427
And establish security
controls that are aligned with

474
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,362
the third party risk management.

475
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,530
In the first month, three
months after this presentation,

476
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,450
you should be able to select the tools

477
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,053
that best suit your needs.

478
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,226
You should choose how to
assess these different vendors

479
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:17,563
either by sending a questionnaire
or doing something else.

480
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,110
Develop a schedule to run the assessments.

481
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,169
And send the assessments to your vendors.

482
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,320
Within in six months,
you should be able to

483
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,750
communicate with vendors
regarding their weak security

484
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,210
controls in place.

485
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,910
And like I said before, be
ready to replace a vendor

486
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,453
if they don't comply with
your cybersecurity standards.

487
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,629
And that concludes my presentation.

488
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,793
Thank you very much.
