00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,880
- Hello, and welcome to
Hackers Going To Hack.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,220
If you're joining us live,

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,570
our speaker is in the Slido discussion

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,000
answering your questions right now.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,290

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,790
I'd now like to turn it
over to Chloe Messdaghi

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,302
for the presentation.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,050
- Thank you for the warm welcoming.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,890
Hi everyone.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,729
I'm so excited to be here today with you.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,040
As she just let you know,

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
in Slido feel free to ask any questions

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,470
throughout this talk.

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,860
I want to let you guys know

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,519
that this is a talk around
gamification infosec

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,450
and such, the best way how to
do a talk about gamification

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,590
is making sure that the talk

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,030
is also interactive and gamified.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,553
So I hope you guys are
excited and ready for this.

21
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:59,190
I will be keeping tabs in
Slido at the same time,

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,290
so it will be interactive.

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,251
So make sure to pay attention
because you never know,

24
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:08,120
you might actually learn
something brand new.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,333
So here we go.

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,009
So today we're going to talk
about Hackers Going To Hack.

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,180
And if you don't know
who I am, first of all,

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,240
my name is Chloe Messdaghi.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,710
I am the VP of Strategy
over at a Point3 Security

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,720
and when I'm not doing that,
I'm an ethical hacker advocate.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,860
And if you're wondering what
is an ethical hacker advocate?

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,720
Well, basically what I do

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,179
is I look around our community

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,130
and see how can I make things
better or improve things?

35
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,179
So if that means getting
rights for hackers,

36
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,210
that means getting rights for hackers.

37
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,740
If that means pushing the
media to really portray us

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,199
in a good light instead of using us

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,910
and seeing us as cyber criminals,

40
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,937
I do so as well.

41
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:50,649
But also to bring in diversity
and inclusion in our field,

42
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,300
making sure that all voices
are being represented

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,193
and have an equal voice.

44
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,810
When I'm not that, I'm also
the president and cofounder

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,611
of WoSEC, which is women of security.

46
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:03,670
We have chapters all over the world.

47
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm also the founder of WomenHackerz.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,168
We have recently changed our name to

49
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,930
We Are Hackers.

50
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,430
Basically, it's a wonderful
private online community

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,430
for hackers that represent
all underrepresented genders

52
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,263
in infosec.

53
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,867
And it's a place for us
to hack at all levels

54
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,125
and also communicate and mingle

55
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,688
and get to know each other

56
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:25,880
and know of all the
different opportunities

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,930
out there for us.

58
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,565
It's a great community to
be a part of and empowering.

59
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:30,770
And when I'm not that,

60
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,090
I'm also the Hacker Book Club Creator.

61
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,287
So, basically we read a book every month

62
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,540
about the hacker community,

63
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,843
and usually it's written by
someone in the hacker community

64
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:43,640
and they attend our weekly meetings,

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,929
which is on Tuesday at
5:00 pm Pacific time.

66
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,680
And not just the authors attend,

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,380
but even those that are
mentioned in the book.

68
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,500
So we just finished one,
"Cult of the Dead Cow"

69
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,240
and actually had CDC members
attending each of the meetings,

70
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,170
which is fabulous,

71
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,436
including the author for

72
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:02,493
the first meeting our last meeting.

73
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,066
I'm also a podcaster for ITSP Magazine's

74
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,310
"The Uncommon Journey"

75
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,033
along with Alissa Miller
and Phillip Wiley.

76
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,070
All right, let's dive into the talk now.

77
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,840
Now what are we going to cover today?

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,810
Well, what is gamification?

79
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,070
For those that do not know,

80
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,430
we'll also do a quick walkthrough history.

81
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,230
Now I want to let you know ahead of time,

82
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,624
this is probably the driest
part of his entire talk,

83
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,692
but if you pay attention closely,

84
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:33,020
you might have a little fun experience.

85
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,520
So keep an eye on everything

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,987
and try your best to recall things.

87
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:41,540
We will be diving next
into how does it work?

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,829
So one of the things I want to do

89
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,640
is talk about cognitive science,

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,640
so how our brain responds to
it and why it works so well.

91
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,783
And so by doing that,

92
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:53,100
we have to learn a little
bit about the temporal lobe

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,160
and within the temporal lobe

94
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,150
there's the hippocampus and the amygdala.

95
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,350
And these are the areas of
gamification where it thrives.

96
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,579
Last but not least, why is it needed?

97
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,740
Why your team should be
involved in gamification?

98
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,952
What are the evidence?

99
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,590
What's the latest research?

100
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,093
And some key takeaways.

101
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:14,000
All right, you guys, I
hope you're ready for this.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,540
Let's do this.

103
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,373
All right.

104
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,579
First thing first, gamification.

105
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,827
The past, present, and of
course its role in infosec.

106
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:23,973
Alright.

107
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,023
So what is gamification?

108
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,040
It's basically,

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,020
a game is a system in which players engage

110
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,349
in artificial conflict defined by rules

111
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,050
that result in a quantifiable outcome.

112
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,953
It has features, mechanics,
dynamics, and aesthetics.

113
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,550
So this is going to be
the driest part, remember,

114
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,829
but pay attention

115
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,010
because you never know
what's coming up next.

116
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,587
So here we go.

117
00:04:55,588 --> 00:05:00,588
In 425 BC, dice games were
created to fight major famine.

118
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:06,210
In 3100 BC, the first board
game was created in Egypt.

119
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,883
S&H Green Stamp, marketers
sold stamps to retailers

120
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:13,010
who used them to reward customers.

121
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,330
And in 1958, the first
video game was invented.

122
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,520
Charles Cardo founds a consulting firm

123
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,570
called The Game of Work

124
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,810
and brings feedback loops found in sports

125
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,423
into the workplace.

126
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,849
MUD1 is created by Roy
Trubshaw at Essex University.

127
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,943
It was the first multi-user
virtual world game.

128
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,176
Thomas Malone publishes

129
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:38,527
"What Makes Things Fun to Learn?

130
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:42,130
"A Study of Intrinsically
Motivating Computer Games"

131
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,130
And in 1981, the first ever
3D video games were released.

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,803
Now, American Airlines
introduced AAdvantage,

133
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,090
the first frequent flyer program.

134
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,369
And a hotel chain called Holiday Inn

135
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,677
saw what American
Airlines did and thought,

136
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:04,370
"Why don't we create our
first hotel loyalty program?"

137
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,203
Which they did.

138
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:07,169
They were the first ones to do it.

139
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,360
And of course, follows the car rental

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,830
as well as National Car Rental

141
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,274
launches their first car
rental rewards program.

142
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:17,190
And in 30% of American
households now at that time,

143
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,850
owns an NES and a new generation
of gamers is now born.

144
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,820
Now, Richard Bartle
publishes "Who Plays MUAs"

145
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,320
which divides video game players

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,130
into four unique personality types.

147
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,820
And in 2002 Serious Gaming Initiative

148
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,753
forges a link between the gaming industry

149
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:37,770
and training health
education and public policy.

150
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,760
In 2003, Nick Pelling coins
the term gamification.

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,340
In 2007 Bunchball created
Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

152
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,109
it gamified website for
the TV show, "The Office".

153
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,858
It receives over 8 million page views

154
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:52,530
in less than six weeks.

155
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,190
2009 Quest To Learn accepts
a class of sixth graders

156
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,543
into a game based learning environment.

157
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,909
2010, DevHub adds a point
system to its website

158
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:06,000
and increases their
user engagement by 70%.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,870
Now in 2010, a first gamification summit

160
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,780
happened in San Francisco, of course,

161
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,450
called Gamification Co.

162
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,204
And now by 2012,

163
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,710
45,000 people have enrolled in

164
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,270
professor Ken Warbuck's
online gamification course

165
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,070
through Coursera.

166
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,330
In 2012 Mozilla Open Badges
initiative is launched.

167
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,609
This is an open source badges

168
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,120
that can be used to mark
accomplishments online.

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,330
In 2012 Gartner predicts that 70%

170
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,090
of the global 2000 organizations

171
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,123
will have at least one
gamified application by 2014.

172
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,849
And last but not least, in 2014,

173
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,080
M2 Research predicts that gamification

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,690
will be a $2.8 billion industry by 2016,

175
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,450
which is completely true,
but it went way beyond that.

176
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,930
It is now expected to be
an $11 billion industry

177
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,060
by the end of this actual year.

178
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,651
Now I know that was a lot of data,

179
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:01,560
but if you paid attention closely,

180
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,437
you'll see the reason why.

181
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,860
Yes, that's right.

182
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,060
Pop quiz time.

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,500
It's bringing back some
memories for you, huh?

184
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,460
I promise you it's fun.

185
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,589
So in Slido, type in your answer

186
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,060
and I'll keep an eye on it.

187
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,283
So what year did the
first video game come out?

188
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,360
Which year you guys?

189
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,313
Which year was the first
video game that came out?

190
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,493
1958.

191
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,994
Next question.

192
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:32,130
Gamification is expected to become

193
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,743
a blank billion dollar
industry by the end of 2020.

194
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,270
So, gamification is expected to be

195
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,829
a what billion dollar
industry by the end of 2020?

196
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,480
Looking at your results in Slido.

197
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,488
11 billion.

198
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:48,621
All right.

199
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,882
Now of course, the fact is
infosec has always been gamified.

200
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,760
I mean, think about it.

201
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,140
CTFs, hackathons, bug bounty.

202
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,640
Many of us became hackers to beat games

203
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,930
and to do better than our
peers who were better than us.

204
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,870
I mean, we found cheat codes.

205
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,880
We found other methods for doing so.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,220
But most importantly, we hunt for bugs.

207
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,610
And it's really like a game of

208
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,573
how far does this foxhole go?

209
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,443
It's the constant how can
I outsmart this and that?

210
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,420
And of course, I'm going to
build an infosec timeline too.

211
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,620
So in October 10, 1995,

212
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,529
Netscape launches the
first ever cash reward

213
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,650
for finding security bugs

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,090
in their Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta.

215
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,120
And the first DEFCON CTF was 1996.

216
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,680
Now, bug finding programs
were created and managed

217
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,199
by companies such as Google,
Facebook, and Mozilla

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,886
based around Netscape's success

219
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:47,430
with having their first quote unquote

220
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,319
bug bounty program.

221
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,224
Pwn2Own started in 2007

222
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,470
and then bug bounty platforms

223
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,660
were founded in 2012 and 2013.

224
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,890
And these ones are of course, as you know,

225
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,205
Bugcrowd, HackerOne, and Synack.

226
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,828
And that was the first time ever

227
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:06,860
there was now all these major companies

228
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,770
didn't have to have their
own bug bounty program.

229
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,526
Instead they could go
with a bug bounty platform

230
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:16,846
that would connect hackers with
companies or organizations,

231
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:20,130
and for them to be able
to have some sort of

232
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,570
bilateral trust agreement
amongst both parties.

233
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,540
Now, this is a game teaching
moment for many hackers

234
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,733
because it suddenly
brought us in a good light.

235
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,489
And for people to start seeing

236
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,820
that there are these things
called ethical hackers

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,310
and not all of us are cyber criminals.

238
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,257
And so by bug bounty programs
really helped with that.

239
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:43,050
But it also pushed forward
on the whole notion

240
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,310
of gamification, right?

241
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,569
The first one to submit a
bug that's a high priority

242
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,020
will get paid out.

243
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,780
So it's one of those things
gamification still works.

244
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,839
And bug bounty platforms are definitely

245
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
really, really important

246
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,730
because we're seeing
so much of an increase

247
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,140
of gamification infosec now,

248
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,230
and it's helping us in so many ways

249
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,210
because now you have more
gamified training programs

250
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,362
to train security teams

251
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:13,803
and have insight on their
team's weaknesses and strengths.

252
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,260
And yes, it's back.

253
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,939
Pop quiz time.

254
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,623
What year was the first
bug bounty created?

255
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,329
What year you guys?

256
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,550
What year was the first
bug bounty program created?

257
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,689
1995.

258
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,850
All right.

259
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,830
Le fin of the pop quiz time or is it?

260
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,319
We shall see.

261
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,089
Let's go into, how does it work now.

262
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,440
Now this is my favorite part

263
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
because I'm obsessed with the brain

264
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,010
and everyone who has seen any
of my other talks previously,

265
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,043
I always bring up the brain

266
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,598
because the brains are the reasons why

267
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:51,226
we're simulating to do what we do

268
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:54,126
and how we think and
why humans do and say,

269
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:56,930
or take any actions.

270
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,191
By knowing the brain, how it works,

271
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:01,299
we have a better understanding
of life in general,

272
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:03,329
and also how people function

273
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,620
and how we can connect
with each other more

274
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,420
and how we are more
connected with each other.

275
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,610
So let's get to know your brain.

276
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,211
So remember those pop quiz questions

277
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:17,211
that stimulated your brain
from that very dry timeline?

278
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,650
Well, that was stimulating the
green section of the brain,

279
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,760
the temporal lobe.

280
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,862
And we're going to dive
into that particular area

281
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,530
where gamefication thrives.

282
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,120
Now, what is the temporal lobe?

283
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,270
the temporal lobe for you to understand

284
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,810
it's involved in processing sensory input

285
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,550
into derived meanings

286
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,459
for the appropriate
retention of visual memory,

287
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,620
language comprehension,
and emotion association.

288
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,404
It is where gamification thrives

289
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:47,780
and where the amygdala
and hippocampus are.

290
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,707
So for example, if we go back
to those pop quiz questions,

291
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,349
you would have noticed

292
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:55,453
that it was very short term information

293
00:12:55,453 --> 00:13:00,453
derived into meanings and so
then you are able to retain it.

294
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,530
And that's how you're able to
pull numbers out of your head

295
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,839
or be able to represent facts

296
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,310
that are recently learned and known of,

297
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,250
because in the temporal lobe

298
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,865
that's where the short term memories

299
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:14,010
turn into longterm memories.

300
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,260
So we're gonna break that down

301
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,160
by first diving into a little bit further

302
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,630
into the temporal lobe.

303
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,420
And so here's the first activity,

304
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,360
and then we'll dive into further
parts of the temporal lobe.

305
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,815
So I'm going to read a couple
of descriptions out loud,

306
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,970
and you're going to fill in the blank

307
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,702
and you can shout it out in your home,

308
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:35,290
or you can whisper it to yourself,

309
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,122
or, you know what?

310
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,120
You could just put it in Slido,

311
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,300
which is awesome because Slido is there.

312
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,310
Alright,

313
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,810
what plant having a
permanently woody mainstem

314
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,599
usually growing to a high height,

315
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,252
developing branches at some
distance from the ground.

316
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,099
What is that?

317
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,830
So I just read you a description.

318
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,463
What is the image that comes to your head?

319
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,180
It's a tree.

320
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,339
Next one.

321
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,710
The nutritious orangy
yellow root of a plant

322
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,795
of the parsley family.

323
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,040
What is it you guys?

324
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,740
I'm keeping an eye on Slido still.

325
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,483
It's a carrot.

326
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,663
All right.

327
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:13,496
Next one.

328
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:16,519
An article of furniture
consisting of a flat top

329
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,733
supported on one or more legs.

330
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,150
It's a table.

331
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,020
All right.

332
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,270
An institution where instruction is given.

333
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,560
I feel like that one's the
easiest one I've read so far.

334
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,729
School.

335
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,563
Alright.

336
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,470
Last one now.

337
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,620
A moving cage for carrying passengers

338
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,833
from one level to another.

339
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,979
Elevator.

340
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,891
Excellent.

341
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,120
Alright.

342
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,643
So let's dive further
into the temporal lobe.

343
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,210
So in the previous activity,

344
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,930
including the pop quiz, once again,

345
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,569
it's stimulates your temporal lobe

346
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,490
by hearing a verbal description

347
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,910
and creating a visual

348
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,780
to show what the description matches to.

349
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,709
It also provides a quick access to memory

350
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,630
and emotional ties.

351
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,970
Overall, the temporal lobe works

352
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,760
with processing sensory
memories to derive meaning.

353
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Now within the temporal lobe,

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,900
one would find them
amygdala and hippocampus.

355
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,410
Now, the thing to note about

356
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,211
is that if you're wondering,

357
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:21,810
"how do I remember things
better and whatnot?

358
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,000
Emotion ties health.

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,470
This is one of the reasons why
you'll remember a nightmare

360
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,960
over a regular dream,

361
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,850
because there's a strong emotion
associated with a memory.

362
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,540
So you'll be able to recall it more.

363
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,199
So think about times
you're extremely happy.

364
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,614
Like you do recall most
of the events that happen

365
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,440
second by second,

366
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,220
but in more nightmarish terms,

367
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,900
you will also recall too.

368
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,745
But if there is no really extreme emotion,

369
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:52,483
you're not going to
recall so many details.

370
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,003
So let's dive first into the hippocampus.

371
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,164
So the hippocampus is
where short term memories

372
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,770
are transferred to longterm memories

373
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,430
later in the temporal lobe.

374
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,109
Our conscious memories are
formed by the hippocampus

375
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,043
by taking a snapshot of
short term working memory

376
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,360
and committing it to a longterm memory

377
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,735
stored in the temporal lobes.

378
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:19,320
And yes, we're going
to do a quick activity.

379
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,263
All right, you guys, here we go.

380
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,900
So I want you to read through
this twice, this list,

381
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,803
and I want you to also keep an
eye on the order that is in.

382
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,733
So I need to read it twice.

383
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,992
Okay.

384
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,293
I think that's good enough.

385
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,380
Now these are the next
steps I want you to do.

386
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,700
I want you to draft an email
or pull up a notes app,

387
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,560
or go old fashioned by
writing with your hand

388
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,790
and try to write down
the objects in order.

389
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,632
You have one and a half
minutes to complete this task.

390
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,500
So go ahead.

391
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,333
You can get started.

392
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,210
I know you already probably started

393
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,270
right when you saw that
there was a next step page,

394
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,453
so go for it.

395
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,129
And then once you kind of figured

396
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,531
as much as you possibly can,

397
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:19,619
put in Slido and let's
see who got the best.

398
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,069
So far of the responses.

399
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,643
I know it's a hard task.

400
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,363
And yes, I'm totally
keeping track of the time.

401
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:04,896
All right.

402
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:08,210
You're almost there, quickly
write down the last ones.

403
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,208
And if you can't find it in
complete order, that's okay.

404
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:14,490
Just make sure to write down
the ones that you do recall,

405
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,293
even if it's not in the
right particular order.

406
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,531
Alright and pencils down, pens down,

407
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:34,495
hands up in the air,

408
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:37,219
or take your hands off your keyboard.

409
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,673
Let's dive into this.

410
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,770
So, let's check it twice here.

411
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,310
How many you guys got this right?

412
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,463
I know this is really hard.

413
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,391
And I understand that.

414
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:52,810
I mean, how many did you guys get right?

415
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,649
Did you get all 10?

416
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,160
Did anyone get all 10
in the correct order?

417
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,590
If you did, wow, congrats.

418
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,540
You have like an incredible
short term memory

419
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,230
and hippocampus when it comes to learning.

420
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,230
But just remember that to be
able to have longterm memory,

421
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,159
you first need to work on functioning

422
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,550
your hippocampus as well.

423
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,780
So doing exercises like
these is very helpful.

424
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,998
And so if you're wondering,
how can I do better next time,

425
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,680
you can make a visual story out of it.

426
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
And that's what experts do.

427
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,230
The more crazy the story is the better

428
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,920
or make it an emotional
story for it to stick.

429
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,040
Overall you want to
improve your hippocampus

430
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,600
and you can do that
through crossword puzzles,

431
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,461
taking a different way home
or whatever destination

432
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,540
to do some gaming modules.

433
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,879
And if you're wondering Chloe wait,

434
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,250
I'm a little confused.

435
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,460
How do I do that?

436
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,350
Well, just think of it like this.

437
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,800
I was walking the streets of London

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,060
and I was carrying an umbrella

439
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,129
and it was a little bit rainy.

440
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,600
And I looked down at my shoe,

441
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,870
cause I stepped on something
that felt a little bit weird

442
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,312
and it was a cuddly toy.

443
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,530
But I didn't know really what it was,

444
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,879
it could have been like a teddy bear,

445
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,123
but his head was cut off,

446
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,250
but it looked like more
like a melon stuffed animal,

447
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,125
believe it or not.

448
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,430
Anyway, I just kept walking

449
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,353
and I almost slipped and
fell right into a tree

450
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:08,497
because I think down on the ground,

451
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:11,310
there was like some cake looking yogurt.

452
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,904
I want to say strawberry yogurt,

453
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:14,701
but I'm really glad that at that time

454
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:17,690
that I quickly noticed
the tree and I didn't slip

455
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,910
because right at that moment,

456
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,010
if I didn't go through that moment,

457
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,920
I would have not seen that
parrot that just flew by

458
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,100
in London.

459
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,929
I mean, it must have gotten
away from someone's home

460
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,740
or some zoo, I guess, but
I was just so thankful

461
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,869
I didn't fall down because
I had my laptop on me

462
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,810
and I'm wearing this red jumper.

463
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,580
And the last time I wore this red jumper

464
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,210
was when I played
basketball with my father.

465
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,780
So you see there was emotion
elements, crazy elements.

466
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,083
So I can recall the list in order.

467
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,889
So let's now talk about your amygdala.

468
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,340
And the amygdala's my
favorite part of the brain.

469
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,399
So the amygala is the
almond shaped section

470
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,380
of nervous tissue

471
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,900
located in the temporal
side lobe of your brain,

472
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,390
which is responsible for your emotions,

473
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,605
your survival instincts and memories.

474
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:02,380
These items are based
around social construction.

475
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,661
And you're wondering what is
a social constructed belief?

476
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:09,460
So social construction is
things around your environment

477
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,782
that told you to be careful of things

478
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:15,189
or to put things in categories,

479
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,650
things that are like us,
things that are not like us.

480
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,520
So for example, if you watched on the news

481
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,665
or you watched in
cartoons or your parents,

482
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:27,620
their reaction towards seeing,
like, spiders and snakes,

483
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,277
you're always going to be
afraid of spiders and snakes

484
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:30,570
in the back of your mind

485
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,030
because you know that it's a real threat.

486
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,357
So if you see a spider or snake,

487
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,010
you're either going to do two things.

488
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,345
You're either going to try to kill it

489
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:40,180
or you're going to run far, far away.

490
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,970
So this is a survival mechanism,
the fight versus flight.

491
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,920
And it's really important to understand

492
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,479
that this is completely subconscious.

493
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,540
And the only time that you're
able to be aware of that

494
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,430
is when it becomes something,

495
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,230
a message going to your
prefrontal cortex of your brain.

496
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,327
But this helps with your emotion.

497
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:01,470
So having an emotion
connected to a memory,

498
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,978
but also when there's
a ticking down clock,

499
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:07,610
it stimulates an emotion of stress.

500
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,652
And when you start getting
anxious and stressed

501
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:11,930
you'll either do two things,

502
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,875
which is you will just stay frozen

503
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,593
or you will work a lot faster
in the most meditative way.

504
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,663
All right.

505
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:22,710
So let's dive into my favorite part now.

506
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,320
Why gamification helps security teams.

507
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,429
Let's be honest now, okay.

508
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,800
Certs are not enough.

509
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,190
New tools and new exploits
come out all the time

510
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,300
and being aware of everything at all times

511
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,000
and the trends along with the burnout

512
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
and the lack of team members,

513
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,390
it leaves us in a huge security risk.

514
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,570
And how many of you guys have experienced

515
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,985
a shortage on your team

516
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,439
and having to take on other hats

517
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,120
to help everyone move along?

518
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,020
Exactly.

519
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,570
So let's dive into why
it's needed more than ever

520
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,230
and how it's becoming a priority
for the infosec community.

521
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,210
And I also want to say that
this is one of the reasons

522
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,315
why I push for gamification
more than anything

523
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,593
is I see it as a solution

524
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,631
to help with most
problems such as burnout,

525
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:10,180
having a skill shortage,

526
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,510
and making sure that
you invest in your team.

527
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,230
If you want to invest in your team,

528
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,650
have a good balance and provide resources

529
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,630
that's going to help your team.

530
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,880
And so gamification is
definitely one of those things

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,660
as we've seen with our brain.

532
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,750
But let's dive into the
statistics of course,

533
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,700
cause I know we're very
data driven people.

534
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,920
So in 2020,

535
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,060
gamification combined with
other latest technologies

536
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,440
and trends will have a significant impact

537
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,237
on the design of employee performance,

538
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:40,349
globalization of higher
education and innovation.

539
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,080
And I'm so glad that Gartner said this

540
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,250
because it took the words
right out of my mouth.

541
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,310
So let's dive into the more
of the facts, shall we?

542
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,860
So overall, fact number one,

543
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,959
within organizations that
hold gamification exercises,

544
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,240
such as hackathon, capture the flag,

545
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,720
red team, blue team,
or bug bounty programs,

546
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,810
are the most common,

547
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,879
and almost all 96% of
those that use gamification

548
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,142
in the workplace report seeing benefits.

549
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:10,943
And 77% of senior managers

550
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:14,610
agreed that their
organization would be safer

551
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,126
if they used more gamification.

552
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,104
And let's be real.

553
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:23,034
We are in a 3 million personnel shortage.

554
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:25,100
And to address the shortage

555
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,879
of skilled cyber security workers,

556
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,470
reports have suggested that gamers,

557
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,720
those that engage and immerse
in online competitions,

558
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,630
may be the logical next
step to plugging the gap.

559
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,240
Nearly all 92% of responsibilities

560
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,480
that gaming enforced players

561
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,570
experience and skills critical

562
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,559
to cyber security threat
hunting, such as logic,

563
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,680
perseverance,

564
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,400
and understanding of how
to approach adversaries

565
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,120
and with a fresh outlook

566
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,013
compared to traditional
cyber security hires.

567
00:24:56,252 --> 00:25:00,055
Not just that, but 77% of employees

568
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,590
find game-based training
to be more effective

569
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,429
than traditional training methods.

570
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,263
Let's be real.

571
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:08,510
Do you guys remember anything
that you read in a textbook?

572
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,343
No.

573
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,918
We learn more when we
do hands on activities

574
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:14,933
at the end of the day.

575
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,142
And that's what gamification provides us.

576
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:23,110
It's a way for us to also be
able to conquer the biases

577
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,209
that exist in infosec.

578
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,080
The other reason why we
have a personnel shortage

579
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,149
is because we're not hiring everyone.

580
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,220
We're hiring those that have certain certs

581
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,490
or a certain number of
years of experience.

582
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,700
And we're also,

583
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,280
there is definitely
discrimination practices happening

584
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,850
on our HR side,

585
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,740
where based on someone's
name or background,

586
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,500
we're already judging that
they're not going to be able

587
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,970
to be highly technical

588
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,533
or not have enough leadership experience.

589
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:54,560
And this also happens when
it comes to promoting people.

590
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,700
So one of the things
that gamification can do

591
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,020
is that it can provide recognition

592
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,860
by showing what people
are capable of doing.

593
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,810
So no longer are you looking at resumes

594
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,163
based on number of years of experience

595
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,221
or certs that you have,

596
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:11,960
you put them right into a
simulation and see how they do.

597
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,646
And if they rock it, then
you know that they should be

598
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:19,646
more into the interview process
to join your security team.

599
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,662
And this is another way to see
who you want to promote too,

600
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,020
because usually the ones
that are quiet in the back

601
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,060
are the ones that you
probably should look more into

602
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,706
and you don't.

603
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:32,930
So invest in your people in other words.

604
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,970
We do have a skills
gap like I said before,

605
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,750
certs are not enough.

606
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,490
I mean, how many of you guys have certs?

607
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,450
Now how many of you believe

608
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,780
that those certs made
you amazing at your job?

609
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,613
Think about it.

610
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:46,920
With skills gaps we're
prone to burn out, breaches.

611
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,740
94% of employees would
stay at a company longer

612
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,130
if it invested in its career development.

613
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,880
And compliance checklist is not enough.

614
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,607
It's just the bare minimum.

615
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:58,600
And last but not least,
the military is all in.

616
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,738
Gamified learning environments
are powerful tools

617
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:03,710
for engaged and motivated
learning experiences,

618
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,850
they're an essential component

619
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,695
of your cyber security training strategy,

620
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,243
which is a natural imperative

621
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:12,120
such as environments help
produce qualified personnel

622
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,250
to meet the demand signal.

623
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,083
In other words,

624
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,780
strong correlations between gaming

625
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,750
and cyber security activities

626
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,310
and gaming and retention

627
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,102
and gaming and recruitment.

628
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,610
And it's very clear that gamification

629
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,490
is a real necessity to have.

630
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,787
It helps those pain points.

631
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,072
And of course,

632
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:35,189
do you guys remember what
percentage of companies that

633
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,223
adopt gamification in the
workplace report seeing benefits?

634
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,123
96%.

635
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,780
Overall, I want the
main takeaway to be here

636
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,839
is that gamification
transforms security teams

637
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,000
and lives.

638
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,261
By investing in your people,

639
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:57,050
you're investing in their personal growth.

640
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,430
It also helps them continuing the balance

641
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,600
of their personal life
and work balance life.

642
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,730
And if you're a good manager,

643
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,671
you want to see

644
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:08,160
that your employees be able to rock it

645
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,280
way further than you.

646
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,258
That's a good manager.

647
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:16,382
Now, overall, from history to
brain functioning and data,

648
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:21,382
it's clear gamification
is needed more than ever.

649
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,620
So we can all be superheroes every day.

650
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,810
And if you're wondering what is,

651
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,540
why superheroes every day,

652
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,269
because if you're either fixing something

653
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:31,620
or you're preventing something

654
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,978
or you're finding vulnerabilities,

655
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,330
the thing is overall,

656
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,409
we're in this together

657
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,614
because our curiosity
also protects people.

658
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,297
Even if you're in sales,

659
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:43,500
even if you're marketing or operations,

660
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,165
the fact that you work for an
infosec company, thank you.

661
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:51,495
We need more and more people
here because we need to exist

662
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:56,416
to make sure that everyone
is protected while online.

663
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,889
And last but not least,
the main takeaways,

664
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,630
if you're a hacker, do some
CTFs, do some bug bounties,

665
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,660
hackathons, you're going
to increase your skills.

666
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,810
And it's going to make you
more desirable as an applicant.

667
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,213
Or if you want to get that promotion,

668
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,597
do those things too.

669
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,485
If you're a manager,
director, VP, or C-level,

670
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,761
invest in your team

671
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:17,060
reduce the skills gap through
gamified training platform.

672
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,222
Because the more you
reduce that skills gap

673
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:23,113
and the more that you invest
in diversity and inclusion,

674
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,210
you're going to see less of a burnout.

675
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,042
You're going to see a way
better security team at the end.

676
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,709
So it will reduce your
possibilities of breaches

677
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,260
because without a good security team,

678
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,540
you're more vulnerable to
risks such as breaches.

679
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,170
And if you have a major
breach, we all know this,

680
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,210
you will lose your product
and you can lose your company.

681
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,900
Overall, people just never stop learning,

682
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,491
your temporal lobe requests it.

683
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:51,990
And thank you guys so
much for catching my talk

684
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,360
and thank you for existing.

685
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,100
I'm in Slido to answer your questions

686
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,129

687
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,780

688
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,083
