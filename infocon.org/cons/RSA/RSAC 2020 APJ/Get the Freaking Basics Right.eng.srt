1
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:16,209
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,100
- Hello and welcome to get
the freaking basics right!

3
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,828
If you're joining us live our speakers

4
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:55,180
are in the Slido chat discussion answering

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,020
your questions right now.

support button below.

8
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,599
I'd like to now turn it
over to Daniel Kroiss

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,143
and Robert Lamprecht for the presentation.

10
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,440
- Hi, and good afternoon.

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,333
I hope you all can hear me, all right.

12
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,760
So we're pre-recording this from Austria

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,820
and it's now about late at night.

14
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,473
So good night also from us.

15
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,570
Yeah, my colleague, Robert and
I will now give you a little

16
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,060
bit of our insights that we've
gathered over the last couple

17
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,130
of years within the field
of security within EMA

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,300
within Europe and border
regions of Europe.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,470
And we wanna get one
message across to you,

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,929
which is we think we still
should work on the fundamentals,

21
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,670
we still should work on the basics.

22
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,300
But before we dive right into our talk,

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,009
I wanna give a quick explanation

24
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,130
to the obvious elephant in the room.

25
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,560
Because most people have
you that know KPMG usually

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
as an auditor, and this should
not be an advertisement.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,441
But this is an actual team
photo from an office party

28
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:20,441
somewhere around four years
ago when KPMG in Austria

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,060
where Robert and I are
based, actually remodeled

30
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,480
their cybersecurity
advisory team and a bunch

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,250
of crazy tech folks got
let loose on this very

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,013
innocent audit cheap people.

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,860
And it has been one hell
of a ride ever since.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,180
And actually, one wouldn't
have thought that working

35
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,730
for an audit company
in an advisory capacity

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,730
in the field of cybersecurity
could actually go that well.

37
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,269
But enough about our employer.

38
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,193
This is Robert and myself.

39
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:59,130
My name is Daniel Kroiss.

40
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,310
I used to work for a start
up somewhere in Vienna

41
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,470
just doing web development stuff.

42
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,750
And then after graduating from university,

43
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,950
I started working in a
security team for a bank

44
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,040
leading a small team there, as well.

45
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,329
And about four years ago, I joined KPMG,

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,463
as security advisory team.

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,240
In my day job usually,
I'm in charge of all kinds

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,580
of different projects from
security architecture,

49
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,943
security strategy.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,830
And in the past, I've been
doing technical security

51
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,760
assessment, red teaming,
OT security, engagement,

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,190
those kind of things.

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,190
And by design, we get called
into quite a lot of incidents.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,400
And this is what we will speak off today

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,730
in this talk and give you
a little bit of insight

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,250
of what we have seen and what
we think is the next steps

57
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,880
that should be taken for
security-minded people

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,447
in the company.

59
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,830
But before we dive into it,

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,360
Robert please introduce yourself.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,193
- Good evening, everyone.

62
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:07,040
My name is Robert.

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm now 16 years now with
KPMG in the role of a director

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,760
and running the security folks in there.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,010
Before I was working with IBM
under Global Services role.

66
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,190
Primarily I'm focusing on
some security strategy parts

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,920
and incident response type of work.

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,300
So whenever there is a
hack attack or some things

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,700
like this running into the
enterprise and checking

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,099
how to get out the attackers,
and of course also wearing

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,460
some more or less assurance
hat or audit type of hat,

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,969
I'm also doing quite a
lot of attestation work.

73
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,740
Checking IT data centers and
service providers globally

74
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,473
doing some SOC 1 or SOC Type
2 kind of reporting thing.

75
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,660
- And of course, for Austria he's typical

76
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,633
he's a mountaineer.

77
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,159
But the two mountains we will get later on

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,253
in our presentation.

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,310
First, usually when we
would be on site with you,

80
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,810
unfortunately we cannot be on
site with you in Singapore,

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,280
which we would really love
to be, but I would want you

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,696
to give us an indication
if those kind of things

83
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:19,453
would sound familiar to you.

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,211
Because these are actually some things

85
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:27,211
that we've encountered in our
previous work a lot, actually.

86
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,440
And I stole this graphic
down there from somewhere

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,450
on Twitter, but it happened
to me multiple times,

88
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,070
both of us multiple times
within our engagements.

89
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,180
When we got called into incident response,

90
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,660
and we were asking, okay we
understand what happened,

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,910
but how's the shape of our infrastructure?

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,060
How good is our infrastructure?

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,410
What's the security health
of our infrastructure?

94
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,170
What's the basic hygiene look like?

95
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,540
And we fell over the most obvious question

96
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,410
like how many assets do you have?

97
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,140
And depending on who you ask,
you get a pretty broad scale

98
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,789
from 4,800 to 9,000 and something.

99
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,083
So if you consider that is a
lot of gap in between them.

100
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,440
And this is actually what we find a lot.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,480
So know your assets, not
so much in most companies.

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,110
And this has been really bugging us.

103
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,110
And yeah, the second
point we also have seen it

104
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,221
so many times, and I'm sure
you've seen it as well.

105
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,660
There's an infection
spreading just everywhere

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,493
in your network.

107
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:35,250
And the hardest part is
telling friend from foe really,

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,950
and this is really when you
don't know what your admins

109
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,360
are doing and if this
is legitimate behavior,

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,960
this really kills you when
time is of the essence

111
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,683
in terms of an incident response.

112
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,470
And even worse is the next point.

113
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,860
Unfortunately, this is so
bad that I couldn't find

114
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,340
a proper meme to go with it.

115
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,010
But I've had this so many
times when we were at clients

116
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,789
on site that the question we had to phrase

117
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,840
after looking at some of
the previous little ability

118
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,840
scanning results was not so
much, the question that we tried

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,070
to answer like how the attacker got in

120
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,630
or how the attacker spread,

121
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,010
all of a sudden didn't be relevant anymore

122
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,770
because it was just so horrible

123
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,299
and there was so much stuff going on,

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,470
on the inside within the perimeter,

125
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,440
that it was just a matter of like how easy

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,577
it was for the attacker to spread

127
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,890
and not if he could have spread,

128
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,039
or she could have spread around.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,730
And last but not least,
for most companies,

130
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,330
we've been working in an
incident response capacity.

131
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,370
There was pretty much admin
credential for everybody.

132
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,463
They were handing out admin
credentials, admin accounts,

133
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,240
like t-shirts at the baseball game.

134
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,580
It was incredible.

135
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,123
Just like you won an admin account,

136
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,380
you won an admin account,

137
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,700
and this just kills you
in case of an incident.

138
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,420
Because if you have 1,000 admin accounts,

139
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,310
local admin accounts on machines
that are just laying around

140
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,120
for the attacker to pick up,

141
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,720
this just kills you in an incident.

142
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,720
And as a consequence of
that and like after our

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,652
incidents we tend to do
our internal debriefs

144
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:19,652
and the funniest things
always happen when it becomes

145
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,120
public or even if you talk to management

146
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,563
or some of the people in
charge at the companies

147
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,310
that we work with.

148
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,120
We've got three very
significant statements

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,030
that just are bugging us and the first one

150
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,309
is like my favorite.

151
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,719
And I've read it now in
the last couple weeks a lot

152
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,710
in the media again when
there were like bigger

153
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,919
security incidents all over Europe.

154
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,676
And like the CEO goes
on camera and says like,

155
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:47,540
"but we've done everything we could.

156
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,349
We are ISO certified
and we're so compliant.

157
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,270
Still, we got hacked."

158
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,210
This is the first thing and Robert and I

159
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,960
are always sending back
and forth the articles

160
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,857
of newspapers where it
is, it wasn't there.

161
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,560
And we're just laughing
because it's like yeah,

162
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,370
you did, right.

163
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,360
But more on that later.

164
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
The second thing usually when
we come in the first thing

165
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,037
that people, especially
management tell us is like,

166
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:18,870
"yeah, but we've spent so much money

167
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,980
on that latest shiny tool.

168
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,250
Why is that not protecting us.

169
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,832
We have antivirus, we've
bought this new firewall."

170
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:28,832
And again, this is also a
very common mistake we see.

171
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,040
And the third one is, and
we've had this happening

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,342
to us also, in a previous engagement,

173
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,840
when we were having this
discussion with a lot

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,927
of folks at the company,

175
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,843
And we were having this big crisis meeting

176
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:46,729
and at some point, some
guy from the CISO office

177
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,870
gets up and says like, "yeah,
we know all those risks,

178
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,617
but everybody accepted them."

179
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,810
And this has also been a huge problem

180
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,863
for companies that we've seen.

181
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,420
And yeah this is actually
where last year at the RSA

182
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,255
Conference in San Francisco
Robert, and I got to talk

183
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:08,140
and like "hey, maybe we
should do a talk about this."

184
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,093
And like, what is it with those things

185
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,199
and why do they keep
still happening from us.

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,393
And this message is that
we're trying to bring across

187
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:21,240
in this talk is really a very basic one.

188
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,360
And we have to focus on
the fundamentals first.

189
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,990
And this is actually the
thing I wanna raise next

190
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,890
and go into more detail.

191
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,069
What we still see and
this we see quite a lot

192
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,220
and coming from an audit
firm, we can really

193
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,820
tell you stories about this,
but compliance is related

194
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,800
to security but compliance is not security

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,479
and security is not compliance.

196
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,010
Those two are in relation to each other,

197
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,960
but they're not the same thing.

198
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,430
And we've had it so
many times and a policy

199
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,099
does not fix a technical issue.

200
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,590
And this is very important
thing to say it out loud

201
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,928
because there's so many people
writing awesome policies

202
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,439
in what should and shouldn't be done.

203
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,170
But like if nobody ever reads the policy

204
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,040
or if it's not enforced,

205
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,919
this is just like walking over a crosswalk

206
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,353
with the red light then.

207
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,360
Yeah, it just happens that
people cross the policy then.

208
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,603
But it's fine documented and
it looks really good on paper.

209
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,300
The next thing, there's
usually two types of companies

210
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,670
when we get called in.

211
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,665
Either the ones on the left hand side,

212
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:35,620
which are more than the other ones,

213
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,290
but the other ones are more significant

214
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,719
on the right hand side.

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,850
On the left hand side,
we have those companies

216
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,430
that try to just solve
every problem with a tool.

217
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,979
And just every problem,
they have to buy a new tool,

218
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,170
they put it in their data
center, they plug in cables,

219
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,670
and be done with it.

220
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,959
This has been happening so often,

221
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,840
that there's actually this
joke that people sometimes make

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,010
about some projects are just robots

223
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,620
to produce hot air and to blink.

224
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,393
They have two lights, blink, blink.

225
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,140
And the other thing is,
and I really enjoy reading

226
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,210
those little Bobby comics I
recommend you to check them out

227
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,900
is if you don't spend money on security,

228
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,540
we will guarantee you that
you will not see any attacks

229
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,089
because you cannot see them,
which is terrible in itself.

230
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,520
But this is how security is still done.

231
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,790
And a lot of companies and there are some

232
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,819
that get better at this.

233
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,710
But still, budget cuts,
especially in a recession still

234
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,330
also affect security, when
you should actually spend more

235
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,993
money on security and this
is still a huge problem.

236
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:48,363
And the next thing, I really
wanna say this out loud.

237
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,709
And this is really
important for me personally,

238
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,800
because a lot of people not realize this.

239
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,689
Accepted security risk, it's fine.

240
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,560
A company has a certain risk
appetite and that's okay.

241
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,229
But this is really important.

242
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,160
If you take home just one
thing from this presentation,

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,250
I would recommend this is it.

244
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,970
Know that your accepted
security risks are still risks.

245
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,810
They can still be exploited by attackers.

246
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,800
And you still have one
hell of an attack surface.

247
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,430
And you have to be aware of this.

248
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,609
Because there's so many
companies where everybody accepts

249
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,887
a risk here a risk there
and so forth and so on.

250
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:32,680
And this culminates to
quite a big, big, big,

251
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,069
big mountain of risks, and
those can still be exploited,

252
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,590
and attackers will not
care if you accepted them.

253
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,360
And this has been a really,
really painful process

254
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,300
for a lot of companies
to learn and this is why

255
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,522
we've put it on a slide.

256
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:49,733
So where do we go from here?

257
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,630
Our house is on fire.

258
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,300
What do we do?

259
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,099
And after an incident,
of course what you do

260
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,230
during an incident it's
clear you have your incident

261
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,580
response processes, and
you have excellent support

262
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,410
and KPMG or competitors
are happy to help you

263
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,180
through your burning house,
but what do we do afterwards?

264
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,719
And we suggest a simple approach.

265
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,850
Let's focus on the basics
first and then worry

266
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,170
about all the other stuff.

267
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,680
And there's really three
key things that we want you

268
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,512
to get right.

269
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:24,440
And if you do that, you
still can get hacked,

270
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,070
but you will make it a hell
of a lot harder for attackers.

271
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,530
Apply critical patches.

272
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,350
All of these patches,
all of these problems

273
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,340
are known problems.

274
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,360
This is nothing new we're telling you,

275
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,470
but we just have to get it done this time.

276
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,440
The same with network segmentation.

277
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,380
WannaCry, NotPetya all of
these malware outbreaks,

278
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,060
all of these ransomware
outbreaks really showed us

279
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,410
how many companies are still
having trouble with this.

280
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,790
And there's so many that
are still having trouble

281
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,079
with this we have to
get this done for good.

282
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,690
We have to put it into the
state of the art network

283
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,350
and fix your privileged accounts.

284
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,770
Last but not least, you have to restrict

285
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,263
who owns elevated
privilege in your company.

286
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,680
And Robert will go into that
a lot more into detail now

287
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,680
but these are three things that
if you have no other things

288
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,920
that you can do, you really
should focus on those.

289
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,613
But now, Robert.

290
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,250
- So we are on slido.

291
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,070
If you have any questions,
feel free to put them

292
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,100
on Slido and we are happy
to answer your questions.

293
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,660
So having heard all the
things that Daniel told us,

294
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,920
let's have a look what the
basics are and how we can tackle

295
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,656
them in order to get things right.

296
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:41,070
And the first essential
part as Daniel mentioned,

297
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,640
was apply the critical patches.

298
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,370
So this time, definitely for real.

299
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,560
Get your boots on the ground.

300
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,729
It's enough already being
said so we should get

301
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,160
our hands dirty, and apply those things.

302
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,500
So applying those patches
throughout the whole

303
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,230
infrastructure, we know
it's a tough type of thing

304
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,870
because everyone complains and tells us

305
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,055
that it might be difficult
to leverage those things

306
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:08,329
in order to increase the
security but the patches

307
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,330
you're applying definitely
throughout the landscape,

308
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,510
protect your business,
they protect your customers

309
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,240
of course, they obviously
protect your data

310
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,090
and finally, they protect your job.

311
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,350
Because it's your job to do the things.

312
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,420
It's your job to assist the executives

313
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,880
and to act with due care
in order to safeguard

314
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,203
the whole environment you're operating in.

315
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,959
Some of the excuses we hear
quite often are, we cannot

316
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,220
patch everything it is too complicated,

317
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,950
things might get too difficult

318
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,080
so we better don't do anything, right.

319
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,780
Enough with all these excuses and so on.

320
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,153
So it's definitely time now to start off

321
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:52,710
with the things that you can patch.

322
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,830
The Pareto principle which
is something doing 80%

323
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,120
or covering 80% by 20% of Mart Ford

324
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,030
is an Oldie but a Goldie.

325
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,165
It still works, it's still
something that you can leverage,

326
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:08,800
you decrease the risk and
you decrease the overall

327
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,849
vulnerabilities for a
whole enterprise footprint.

328
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,679
Definitely one of the essentials is here

329
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,270
to prioritize right.

330
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,160
Therefore start off 50 assets
that are of your importance.

331
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,369
The assets that have the most contribution

332
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,229
to your business processes
to your enterprise

333
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,220
and the vulnerabilities
which are critical at risk.

334
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,050
Meaning everything
which has a score higher

335
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,580
than seven in the CVA rating.

336
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,740
That's definitely something you can use

337
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,130
to prioritize your things.

338
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,540
We know manually, you cannot
cover all these things.

339
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,530
So therefore, automate as
much as possible tools.

340
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,810
Windows like Microsoft have
the SCCM or in the Linux

341
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,050
and Unix environment
there's is Puppet or Ansible

342
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,720
available that you can use.

343
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,050
And please do us a very big favor.

344
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,950
Don't forget the network infrastructure

345
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,416
and because of the whole
digitization and the spread

346
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,800
of new devices being involved like IoT,

347
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,168
also include them and apply
the patches there as well.

348
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:10,729
Last but not least one learning for us

349
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,140
in our cases was don't trust the IT guys

350
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,500
if you ask them did you patch everything,

351
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,690
because the answer will always be yes.

352
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,688
Make your vulnerability
scanner be your best friend

353
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,047
to check effectiveness
because one case we had,

354
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:26,760
there was WannaCry.

355
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,797
The company we were supporting
before was actually saying

356
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:32,630
"we applied the latest patches,
but they didn't actually

357
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,250
restart the system in order to make

358
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,890
the patches become effective."

359
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,770
This is definitely something you can check

360
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,580
with vulnerability scanners.

361
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,413
Daniel.

362
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
- So here's an odd thing,

363
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,739
but this is a CISOs tale, and
we've seen this a lot of times

364
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,773
happening within multiple companies.

365
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,080
But Robert is the mountaineer of us,

366
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,639
but I will tell you
something about mountains

367
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
as for Austrian presentations.

368
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,390
Don't mind the numbers
on there they're just

369
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,990
for exemplary purpose.

370
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,860
But on every side of every
vulnerability management program

371
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,350
when a company hasn't
been doing this, right,

372
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,762
and this should be a message
of encouragement for you.

373
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,919
You started off somewhere, didn't you?

374
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,100
Round about what they
had and then you round

375
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,163
about what the probabilities were, right.

376
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,787
And then they started off like,

377
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:27,510
"hey, let's do vulnerability management.

378
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,300
Let's get everything patched, right."

379
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,220
And at some point, they're
looking at the numbers

380
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,090
and like, "this is really bad.

381
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,560
What are we going to do?"

382
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,600
There's so many vulnerabilities,

383
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,070
and they have spent quite a lot of money

384
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,090
on this new fancy tool, and
they go further with it.

385
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,060
And then there's the point where the CISO

386
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,486
actually, or most of the
security team is like,

387
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,470
"oh, I should probably look for a new job

388
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,687
because this is bad."

389
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,673
And here's the message of encouragement.

390
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,879
There's a peak and you have to get there.

391
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,390
This is painful process
you don't know really

392
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,340
where this peak is.

393
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,342
Because it might be the case
if you're in a bigger company

394
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,630
and we've seen this happening,
you find a couple hundred,

395
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,808
you find a couple
thousand servers somewhere

396
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:19,520
and all of a sudden
your vulnerability score

397
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,930
increases or the number
of vulnerability increases

398
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,180
by 10 times and this is just what happens.

399
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,530
You gotta accept that this
is the technical depth

400
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,060
your company has raised.

401
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,889
But once you get to this
top, you can actually be glad

402
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,750
because it won't get any
more worse than that.

403
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,420
And this is a good way
you can tell a good season

404
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,793
apart from not as good
season because this person

405
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,820
actually goes in and
gets their hands dirty.

406
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,750
It's like okay, now we know how bad it is

407
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,880
now we have to do
something about it, right?

408
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,460
And this process will be hard.

409
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm not gonna make you
any illusions about that.

410
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,700
You will have a very slow
start and this will be really

411
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,310
tedious process at the beginning.

412
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,679
But once you start working on it,

413
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,680
and once you get also
the IT folks convinced

414
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,540
that there is a way of going
downwards on that mountain,

415
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,750
they will start working with
you, they will be reluctant

416
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,630
at first maybe, but you
will get them there.

417
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,960
And they will actually
realize that this is not

418
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,010
as hard as they thought.

419
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,620
And this is a critical point.

420
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,919
As soon as you get to the point

421
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,670
and you get the IT folks to realize

422
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,120
and the business folks realize, okay,

423
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,620
this is not as bad as we thought it is.

424
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,488
You actually get down that
mountain faster and faster.

425
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:35,773
And all of a sudden, you're in the point

426
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,560
where you can start thinking

427
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,669
about accepting risks again, right?

428
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,330
This is the point somewhere in this area

429
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,840
is the point where you actually
have a decent risk state.

430
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,320
And you can actually think about okay,

431
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,153
this might be the last 10 15% of my assets

432
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:52,143
that might be somewhere one
or two that I could accept,

433
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,060
but definitely not before that not as long

434
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,659
as you're somewhere up on that mountain.

435
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
That tech surface is just too
big and just really prepare

436
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,860
for one hell of a mountaineering tour.

437
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,969
And, Robert I'm sure will
tell you in another session

438
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,470
or if we were in Singapore
a lot about mountaineering.

439
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,037
I cannot about mountaineering
though (laughing)

440
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,568
but Robert, please.

441
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:19,697
- So if you have any questions
about the mountaineering

442
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:22,790
of the CISO feel free
to reach out in Slido.

443
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,470
And we're happy to answer your questions.

444
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,440
But moving forward,
what are the next issues

445
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,210
that we need to tackle in terms of patches

446
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,060
and the like?

447
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,200
One of the most difficult
parts that we are seeing

448
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,470
is the technology lifecycle management,

449
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,710
because it's one of the biggest unsolved

450
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,626
challenges and complex
things in enterprises,

451
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,600
because of the size and the
complexity of the enterprise.

452
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,810
It can cause actually a lot of headache

453
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,790
to you if you don't
tackle these things right.

454
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,340
And if you don't do these things in order

455
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,850
to protect your environment.

456
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,899
We know that the time the
enterprise moves along

457
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,994
and the enterprise develops,
some things will remain

458
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:07,240
and you don't wanna touch
them because they're unstable

459
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,333
and they provide valuable
contribution to the business.

460
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,844
But I assure you that you
wanna pay the interest rate

461
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,710
of the technical debt
you're amassing over time.

462
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,130
So that is a question that
you need to ask yourself.

463
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,644
However, we strongly advise
you and this is also what our

464
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,470
experience has shown us.

465
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,060
It is better to pay up now

466
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,730
and tackle the things
at the very early stage

467
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,850
and look after decommissioning

468
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,213
and phasing out the old technologies,

469
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:38,310
reducing the attack surface
and reducing the likelihood

470
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:41,730
of attackers being successful.

471
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,390
So, in addition if you have
this lifecycle management,

472
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,790
if you are aware of what
you have in your enterprise,

473
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,812
you also have a certain
visibility and you are improving

474
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:56,810
the visibility in your
enterprise to see what assets

475
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,570
you have and to see what is going on

476
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,740
in your network and amongst your systems.

477
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,900
So, therefore technology
lifecycle management

478
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,793
is definitely an essential part.

479
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,780
So, our strong advice is
get rid of the old stuff,

480
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,230
move it out of the enterprise and prepare

481
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,323
some technology lifecycle
management plans.

482
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,270
Another thing that comes to our attention

483
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,030
over the past few months is definitely

484
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,470
the network segmentation part.

485
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,202
Now, this time for good.

486
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:31,040
I think even religion has told us now

487
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,300
that the earth is not flat any longer,

488
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,360
and so shouldn't be your network.

489
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,350
So you should definitely
make sure that your network

490
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,110
is not any longer a flat type of network.

491
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,300
That is something that
we have learned probably

492
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,540
in the past, but it's something definitely

493
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,844
which is not any more valid for present

494
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:49,800
and for the future.

495
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,790
Therefore, in recent
cases, micro segmentation

496
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,680
would have saved enterprises

497
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,000
in case of ransomware outbreaks.

498
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,520
If you have encapsulated those,
if you have have protected

499
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,740
the crown jewels yeah,
we're not gonna give you

500
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,100
another talk about the
crown jewel type of thing,

501
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,649
because you've already
heard about this quite often

502
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,179
but the network segmentation
is definitely something

503
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,900
that is for your business
and for protecting

504
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,670
your intellectual property,
your customer data

505
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,483
or your sales data.

506
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,730
Something that is
definitely here a key part

507
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,760
is when segmenting the network
or splitting the network

508
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
apart, to have some separated things

509
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,170
and to have some so
called Tier 0 environment

510
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,090
which is for your privileged accounts,

511
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,070
workstations and admin users.

512
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,050
It is definitely something
of your safe haven,

513
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,990
if you have an attack
if you have an outbreak

514
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,250
where you can move backwards
and start off there

515
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,513
to deploy some new, trusted environment.

516
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,750
Moving along the journey and talking

517
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,870
about privileged things
also comes into our mind

518
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,173
the handling of the privileged accounts.

519
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,150
But over the time, we have
seen the privileged accounts

520
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,240
are spread amongst the whole
enterprise for instance,

521
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,840
that some type of service
accounts running with domain

522
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,290
or admin privileges.

523
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,200
This is something definitely
attackers are looking after.

524
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
So therefore it is
essential part to separate

525
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,030
the privileged IDs from the user IDs.

526
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,379
Yeah, we're not gonna
do another tool talk,

527
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,110
but definitely it can help with tools

528
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,389
to circumvent these issues.

529
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,050
And if you have some budget constraints,

530
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,409
some self developed
wrappers and other things

531
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,053
can help you in order
to tackle this issue.

532
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,629
As we are now in the year 2020.

533
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,910
Definitely we cannot avoid
multi factor authentication

534
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,710
any longer for privileged accounts.

535
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,870
It is a so called must
that we need to establish.

536
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,729
Definitely we can.

537
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,150
It's a good argument also
to get rid of text messages

538
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,010
as the second factor if you've introduced

539
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,860
multi factor authentication.

540
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,189
But as long as you have a second factor

541
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,093
it definitely protects you.

542
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,430
And finally, when it
comes towards protection

543
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,860
of those privileged
accounts, it also makes sense

544
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,439
to enable those privileged
users with an own workstation,

545
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,050
or a ritualized workstation
to have some just in time

546
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,290
privileges in order to
avoid lateral movement

547
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,253
and to detect this lateral
movement amongst the enterprise.

548
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,240
So our house is on fire what
we have heard at the beginning,

549
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,074
but what do we do from now?

550
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:35,750
The things we have mentioned
and explained to you before,

551
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,260
try them at home and get
the freaking basics right!

552
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,610
We definitely didn't
tell you some new things

553
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,699
because these are things we
already heard in the past

554
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,770
but still, enterprises
don't apply the basic cyber

555
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,940
principles and basic cyber hygiene.

556
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,790
So applying the patches, fix
this network segmentation,

557
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,080
and clean up your privileged
accounts in reality,

558
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,949
in order to make sure you have
a safe and sound environment.

559
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,016
These things I said are not new.

560
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:08,570
We never did traditional
security in the past, right?

561
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,970
So we know all of the
things that we have to do.

562
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,917
So let's do them now.

563
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:18,330
And let's protect our
enterprise for safe business

564
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,263
in the future.

565
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,954
Thank you very much for your attention.

566
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:25,320
If you have any questions,
just drop us again,

567
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,830
a note in Slido and we
are happy to answer them.

568
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,179
Daniel, and I would like to
thank you for your attention.

569
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,180
And with this takeaway,
and with these highlights,

570
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,900
we hope that you have
the ability to strengthen

571
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,010
the security of your enterprise.

572
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,060
Thank you very much, and have a nice day.

573
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,203
- Thank you.
