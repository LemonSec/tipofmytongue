1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:02,615
(bright music)

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,638
(ominous music)

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,435
- [Voice-over] Please
welcome, George Takei.

4
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,250
(congregation cheering)

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,393
- Hello, everybody!

6
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,689
I'm honored to be here
with all of you today,

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,773
in San Francisco.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,683
A human element. What makes us, us?

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,790
For 200,000 years,

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,200
roughly the amount of time
human kindness existed.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,550
We've been walking on two feet, exploring,

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,763
living with others,
sometimes avoiding others.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,780
Before long, our brains grew huge.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,113
86 billion neurons huge and counting.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,599
Aristotle told us that

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,320
we are rational animals seeking knowledge.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,020
Confucius added that
humans are benevolent.

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,866
Oh, my!

19
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,470
(congregation laughing)

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,683
I hope that's true.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,443
I hope we're designed to help one another.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Psychologists say that when we
grow up in a group or family,

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,440
we seek to be like one another.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,500
But we also seek to be different.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,280
So, if you're good at math,

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,490
your siblings will
either enjoy your pursuit

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,759
or excel at something else.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,020
If you yearn to be something that

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,170
doesn't quite suit your group dynamic,

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,370
or if you feel alone,

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,910
you might seek out others
to form a new community

32
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,280
where you can be exactly
who you long to be.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,913
How beautiful is that?

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,310
Every mind in this room,
works in its own unique way.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,373
Like fingerprints, no
two brains are the same.

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,370
Each thought is informed
by your genetic disposition

37
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:14,500
and your environment, life experiences,

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,213
race, gender,

39
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,713
age,

40
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,256
beliefs,

41
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:22,840
brain chemistry.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,770
This exquisite diversity
enables us to handle problems

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,753
that might (indistinct)
us if we face them alone.

44
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,260
This reminds me of a beloved acronym

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,573
first added over 50 years ago

46
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:43,992
on Star Trek: The Original Series.

47
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:44,834
(indistinct)

48
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,260
(congregation cheering)

49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,260
It extends for infinite diversity
in infinite combinations.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,810
You innately think differently.

51
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,180
The very human and unprogrammable future

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,050
empowers you to help defend our world.

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,230
Some of you are hunters,
you seek out facts.

54
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,060
Others are gatherers,

55
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,920
collecting and sharing
intelligence with others.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,059
A number of you are builders,

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,660
making companies and inventing solutions.

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,164
There`re also fixers among you

59
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:25,880
who repair systems and restore data

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,811
and there`re those who think differently,

61
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:32,750
outliers and dreamers among you.

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Together, you protect our world
against destructive attacks.

63
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,870
You defend us from any threat imaginable.

64
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,863
In your industry,
homogeneity equals disaster.

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,980
But unity of purpose among
very different people,

66
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,040
that's another story.

67
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,780
No matter what differentiates you,

68
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,930
you are united by a common purpose.

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,930
Preventing, detecting and
responding to threats.

70
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,620
I ask each of you

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,210
to think about your
personal human element.

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,293
Are you an idealist or an altruist,

73
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,442
a mentor or a student,

74
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,023
a rebel or a collaborator.

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,290
We must honor our diverse traits

76
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,883
for our species to stay alive.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,170
If we are benevolent
about our differences,

78
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,170
we can boldly go where
no one has gone before.

79
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,969
As you leave the keynote today,

80
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,850
I invite you to explore our
human element installation

81
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,680
outside in the lobby and
upstairs and the engagement zone.

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,600
There you may choose a human
element that identifies you

83
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,060
to the RSA conference community.

84
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,253
Wear it proudly,

85
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,103
as I am.

86
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,480
Open your mind to the people
you need in the coming days.

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,080
Embrace your similarities,
celebrate your differences

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,080
and revel in the possibility
that everyone you encounter,

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,670
so different yet so align,

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,670
might possess the very element
you need to change our world.

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,883
Thank you for being extraordinary humans.

92
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,706
Live long and prosper.

93
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:34,539
(congregation clapping)

94
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,872
(congregation cheering)

95
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,152
(bright music)

96
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:01,420
- [Voice-over] Think you`re
special? One of the kind?

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,620
We agree.

98
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,260
The way you pursue your digital
ambitions is unique to you

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,920
and so is your appetite for digital risk.

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,090
Whether you`re hybrid
connecting your ecosystem,

101
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,270
empowering a distributed workforce,

102
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,870
rapidly leveraging cloud,

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,190
IoT, AI or other new technologies,

104
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,790
RSA is here to help you
manage digital risk your way,

105
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,000
at every stage of your journey.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,738
So, go ahead. Be you.

107
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:28,321
(bright music)

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,740
- Hello and welcome to the first
day of RSA conference 2020,

109
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,750
Asia Pacific in Japan.

110
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,630
Thank you for joining us.

111
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,740
There`re three tracks of great content

112
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,030
available to you today

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,520
as well as interactive experiences,

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,219
Capture the Flag Tournament

115
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,760
and insights from our partners
in the Resource Center.

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,490
If you have any audio or video issues,

117
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,270
please check the technical
support button below.

118
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,320
It's now my pleasure to
introduce Rohit Ghai,

119
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,281
president of RSA, for
today's keynote presentation.

120
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,533
Thank you.

121
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,230
- Linda, thank you and welcome, everyone.

122
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,250
Let's do this.

123
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,353
Where actually, It's a great
pleasure to be with all of you.

124
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,090
I ask you the question, what
is it that makes us human?

125
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,869
Is it our opposable thumbs?
The size of our brains?

126
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,910
The fact that we can pass
the (indistinct) test,

127
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,380
or something entirely else.

128
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,070
We are biologically hardwired for stories.

129
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,349
In fact, since the dawn of time,

130
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,893
we have gathered around
fires and told stories.

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,849
Opposable thumbs,

132
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,960
let us hang on.

133
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,000
It is our stories that
tell us what to hang on to.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,913
Stories make us human.

135
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Stories have a profound impact

136
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,440
on the way we think, feel and act.

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,260
They move us to be better.

138
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,909
Today, nurses and doctors are
writing new stories of heroism

139
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,900
on the front lines of the global pandemic.

140
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,669
They remind us of the meaning
of courage and sacrifice.

141
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,480
We also see new heroes calling out

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,850
and taking on social injustice.

143
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,850
Their example challenges
us all to be ever better.

144
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,940
These stories we tell change the world.

145
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,660
In fact, in 1977, three brilliant minds,

146
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,700
told a story about Alice and Bob.

147
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,353
Two characters who had a need
to have a secret conversation.

148
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,480
By humanizing this narrative,

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,930
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Lennar Edelman

150
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,160
ignited the imagination of
cryptographers everywhere.

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,360
This particular story
created an iconic company

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,050
and industry and a conference.

153
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,180
Since our theme this year
is the human element,

154
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,420
what better way than to discuss this

155
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,329
and review the story of cybersecurity

156
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,700
paying particular attention

157
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,083
to the human characters in our story?

158
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,290
I am honored to welcome the good humans

159
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,400
in the story of cybersecurity,

160
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,463
to RSA conference 2020.

161
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, a story has a backdrop,

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,850
an editor, actors and observers.

163
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,760
2000 years ago, Aristotle identified

164
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,141
the elements of a great story.

165
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,873
Pity, Tria, and catharsis.

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,650
The narrator depicts a struggle

167
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,380
in which the observer feels pity

168
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,540
and gets emotionally entangled
with the one struggling.

169
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,219
The Jeopardy escalates, instilling fear

170
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,720
in the heart of the observer.

171
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,640
The resolution drives catharsis,

172
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,830
delivering dopamine
into the observers brain

173
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,263
and landing the story in their head.

174
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,070
One of the key storytellers of our time,

175
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,890
you all know a Harare.

176
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,100
Says, "A story`s impact is correlated

177
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,060
with the number of heads it lives inside

178
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,400
and not how real it is."

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,140
So in order to change our future,

180
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,140
we must change and spread our story.

181
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,700
There are three steps to doing that.

182
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,940
First, we must understand
the story we have.

183
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,660
Step two, we need to contrast
that with our reality today

184
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,130
and step three, we should
agree to the story we want

185
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,689
and land it in lots of hearts.

186
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,103
So, let's get into exactly that.

187
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,720
The first draft of our
story was very simple.

188
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,170
The backdrop was deep in the
bowels of the data center.

189
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,290
Attacker versus defender,

190
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,860
technologies towards it`s technologist,

191
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,080
protecting technology infrastructure.

192
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,830
Now, we didn't have a lot
of observers at this point

193
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,048
and it was us, the defender
narrating the story.

194
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,330
Now that's the story we had.

195
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,710
In truth, it was never that simple

196
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,440
and we could debate what our
founding myth should have been.

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,703
Regardless, it's definitely
not our story today.

198
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,910
The story we have is one where we protect

199
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,459
a pervasive technology infrastructure.

200
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,073
It's no longer just the data center.

201
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,470
Its core, cloud and the edge

202
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,200
and in a world powered by data,

203
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,130
we find ourselves
responsible for the security

204
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,843
and privacy of that data.

205
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,110
We don't just protect technology and data

206
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,060
but the humans that use these assets

207
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,920
and in fact their trust in them.

208
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,920
The most important asset
we protect is trust.

209
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,640
That is why the human element

210
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,872
of cybersecurity is so important.

211
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,990
Users are not important
characters in our story

212
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,660
and we often label them as
the first line of defense.

213
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,089
We have come to believe that
their awareness, education

214
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,893
and the level of vigilance
is vital for cybersecurity.

215
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,520
Most great narratives have a plot twist,

216
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,880
a sudden unforeseen shift
that confounds our assumption

217
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,273
disrupts our patterns
and compels us to change.

218
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,480
Our story is no different.

219
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,480
The COVID-19 pandemic has
fundamentally shaken every aspect

220
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,283
of how we live, plug and play.

221
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,240
Our sector has working theories

222
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,323
of how to manage core
edge and cloud computing.

223
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,160
We understood the clear and distinct roles

224
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,930
that security have in
supporting business functions.

225
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,420
We knew where our vulnerabilities were

226
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,713
and how to protect them.

227
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,859
Or so we thought.

228
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,540
The Coronavirus has stopped
all our assumptions.

229
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Business once assumed
that work was a place.

230
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,810
A place that protected
the crown jewels, data,

231
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,949
and as long as IT kept
the walls high enough,

232
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,423
then we could protect what matters most.

233
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,450
Today we`ve realized that
work is not a location,

234
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
it's an activity

235
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,810
and in fact,

236
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,000
data isn't the crown jewel

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,750
locked up in the tall tallest towers.

238
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,370
It is everywhere in people's homes,

239
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,690
access to your personal devices,

240
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,160
transmitted via family WiFi.

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,339
So next time you contact your bank,

242
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,580
remember that whoever you're speaking with

243
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,380
is accessing your financials
from their living room

244
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,380
and there just might be
a zoom birthday party

245
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,333
taking place back in their kitchen.

246
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,523
Now, plot twist also expose winners.

247
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,193
We always knew that
ransomware was a threat.

248
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,100
But the plot twist of COVID-19
has expanded this new attack.

249
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,470
As organizations have
scrambled to move their people

250
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,160
and assets to home networks,

251
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,730
hackers in fact, have adapted
and moved just as quickly

252
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,150
to exploit the confusion,

253
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,089
targeting remote workforce infrastructure

254
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,953
and hastily established
authentication mechanisms.

255
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,310
In fact this region, the APJ region,

256
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,880
has been hit especially hard.

257
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,148
In the first quarter of 2020,

258
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:13,100
APJ encountered nearly 60%

259
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,910
of the reported ransomware attacks.

260
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,819
A PricewaterhouseCoopers report

261
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,410
noted that cyber attacks
on Indian organizations

262
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,823
doubled from January to March.

263
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,513
So this twist on the plot has
taught us many new things.

264
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,130
First, it's clear to us today

265
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,950
that global problems

266
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,893
require global universal effort.

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Cybersecurity is a global problem.

268
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,033
In fact, I've called it a weak link spot.

269
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,560
We cannot win, unless
everyone contributes.

270
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,859
Second, success in our industry

271
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,313
is not the eradication of
the threat or the wires.

272
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,360
It is about making sure life
can go on despite the threat.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,240
It is about bending the curve,

274
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,720
so business impact does not overwhelm us

275
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,923
and third, success is not
a point in time event.

276
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,880
The threats will wax and
wane, there maybe resurgences.

277
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,510
There will certainly be
different future threats

278
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,684
that we will need to deal with.

279
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:34,684
Success is a process and a
mindset. It's not an event.

280
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,729
So based on these learnings

281
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,730
and a new reality, emboldened adversaries,

282
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,829
security teams have been
pushed to the brink.

283
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,273
We weren't prepared for
the story that we now have.

284
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,810
Well, the only good news
is that by shaking us,

285
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,229
by making us uncomfortable,
by forcing us to act,

286
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,893
these block twists also reveal heroes.

287
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,720
They allow the human element to shine,

288
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,933
demonstrating our depth,
resilience and ingenuity.

289
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,589
Cyber security personnel

290
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,459
immediately adapted to this new challenge,

291
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,010
standing up remote workforces

292
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,252
and creating digital platforms
needed to manage risk.

293
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,490
In fact, we have the
pediatric healthcare provider

294
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,020
work across state lines
and extend health care

295
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,590
to those that needed it.

296
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,419
In Qatar, an IT team mapped
out new vulnerabilities

297
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,420
protecting patients and helping
to keep 18,000 beds in use

298
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,790
when they were needed most.

299
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,210
In Singapore, government officials

300
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,546
began working from home
practically overnight.

301
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:54,950
In the US, NASA found
a way for its personnel

302
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,830
to aim for the stars even
as they work from home.

303
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,322
The Mars Rover Program kept on going.

304
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Look, challenges compel us to
reimagine the story we have

305
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,503
and instead, write the story that we want.

306
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,163
As we rewrite a story,

307
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,940
we have to think about

308
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,190
participating in incident
response exercises

309
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,970
suited to the moment.

310
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,790
For the foreseeable future,

311
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,639
we cannot count on war rooms
filled with focused analysts.

312
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,930
Instead, we'll need to
rely on distributed teams

313
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,180
who are balancing home and
work life simultaneously.

314
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,000
Leadership must account
for the human element.

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Run tabletop exercises to
reveal how virtual socks fall.

316
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,150
By participating in these exercises,

317
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,410
CEOs cultivate empathic leadership

318
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,460
and can address leadership,
governance and people issues

319
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,593
before they become all
organizational vulnerabilities.

320
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,130
Now, as we rewrite that story,

321
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,960
let's also expand our cast of characters

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,330
and rethink our culture.

323
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,330
Face it, our sector has
been elitist and exclusive.

324
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,690
It is no surprise that we
have struggled to find talent.

325
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,433
We've driven it away or
discounted it altogether.

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,709
Now that's true everywhere,

327
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,553
but it's particularly troubling for MPJ.

328
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
In 2018, Korn Ferry
estimated that by 2030,

329
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,790
Asia Pacific would see
a labor skill shortage

330
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,790
of 47 million employees
representing an unrealized output

331
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,733
of more than $4.2 trillion.

332
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,670
That's the largest
percentage of the economy

333
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,670
affected by the IT talent
crunch anywhere on earth.

334
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,290
We cannot ladies and gents,
continue being stem snobs.

335
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,590
Cloud computing and cybersecurity roles

336
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,590
are being left unfilled,
particularly in Asia Pacific.

337
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,070
We have been too narrow minded

338
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,679
about our team`s geography.

339
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,440
If the pandemic has taught us anything,

340
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,070
it's that it doesn't
matter where someone sits

341
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,000
as long as they can get the job done.

342
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,893
It's easier than ever to
source talent from anywhere.

343
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,993
So why aren't we?

344
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,260
Another untapped resource
is neurodiversity,

345
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,610
which is simply being
wired or coded differently.

346
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,590
The neuro diverse can
bring new perspectives

347
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,010
and solve problems differently.

348
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,690
There remain a largely
untapped talent pool

349
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,523
with unemployment running as high as 80%.

350
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,222
To be clear,

351
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:03,580
homogeneity is a global issue

352
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,360
and in the last few weeks,

353
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,060
protesters around the
world have marched against

354
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,060
or over attacks of racism
and structural inequities.

355
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,410
Our sector cannot be complicit

356
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,410
in perpetuating social injustice
and lack of inclusiveness.

357
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,810
We all, must do more to learn

358
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,669
from our black and
underrepresented colleagues.

359
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,250
Provide them with the
platform they need to thrive

360
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,890
and build teams that will reflect

361
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,063
the diversity of our communities.

362
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,020
Writing a story also allows us

363
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,810
to reconsider the broader arc.

364
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,490
Our destination and motivation.

365
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,650
We're still coping with COVID-19

366
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,520
but post Coronavirus war is coming.

367
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,493
We should prepare for it now.

368
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,840
Doing so is in our DNA.

369
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,290
Using our past to anticipate the future

370
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,129
is one of the things that sets as apart.

371
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,100
That makes us human.

372
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,060
So if work is no longer a place,

373
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,173
if you data is no longer a hidden gem.

374
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,150
Then lets use this disruption

375
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,323
to fundamentally rethink what
we do and why we do this work.

376
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,770
In the story we want,

377
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,710
our sector restores and preserves trust

378
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,660
in digital technologies

379
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,660
by successfully managing
digital and cyber risk.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
The story we want is not a fairy tale,

381
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,490
without intrusions and breaches.

382
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,870
Instead, it's a world in which
the impact of those breaches

383
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,943
doesn't impede human progress.

384
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,740
In the story we want,

385
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,960
business stakeholders, the
board and the risk office

386
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,770
are actively engaged from the start.

387
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,889
Their perspectives and
insights provide the strategy

388
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,740
and context that helps
security operations teams

389
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,513
prioritize and focus on
risks that matter most.

390
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,390
In the story we want,

391
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,390
IT and software makers are
raised from being bit players

392
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,112
to leading active roles.

393
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,060
They, not our end users act
as the first line of defense.

394
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Moreover, the roles
agency and oversight grows

395
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,000
as edge computing and the Board of DevOps

396
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,170
continue to expand tax footprint

397
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,063
and rapidly develop new updates.

398
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,879
Because the next disruption will come,

399
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,220
whether it's another
pandemic, a natural disaster,

400
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,580
changing climate or something else,

401
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,970
we must apply the insights

402
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,290
we've learned over the last few months

403
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,800
to maintain business continuity.

404
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,389
Adapt our supply and distribution chains

405
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,803
and build resiliency.

406
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,570
Cybersecurity is a problem of resiliency.

407
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,939
Now, if you've learned anything

408
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,570
from the sudden work from home orders,

409
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,939
the surge in disrupted workforces

410
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,039
and accelerate digital transformation

411
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,800
of every sector on earth,

412
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,360
is that cyber security is a resilience

413
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,283
and business risk problem.

414
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,320
Every protagonist faces crisis like these

415
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,560
and it's precisely this,
is what makes them heroes.

416
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Because it's only by
acknowledging the stakes,

417
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,290
finding new depths and
battling against obstruction

418
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,513
that we can change our story
and create the world we want.

419
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,129
So from artificial intelligence,

420
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,470
to the advent of quantum
computing, to global pandemics,

421
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,269
the story of 2020 might
look like science fiction,

422
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:19,269
but our story, will intrinsically
be one about humans.

423
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,590
About our struggle to
adapt to new challenges

424
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,763
and a triumph overcoming them together.

425
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,417
To paraphrase Haruki Murakami,

426
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,669
"When you come out of the storm,

427
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,020
you will not be the same
person who walked in."

428
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,713
That's what the storm is all about.

429
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,990
We must turn to each other for advice,

430
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,960
for clarity, for inspiration

431
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,470
and that's why this conference is created

432
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,157
to foster connections that
strengthen our ability

433
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:56,763
to tackle complex challenges.

434
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,640
So, whatever fire it is
that you gather around

435
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,500
and whichever way it is
that you tell our story,

436
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,100
make sure it's the right one.

437
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,939
Because when the fire is
long gone and so are we,

438
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,610
It is our story that`ll live on

439
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,179
and it`ll guide those
after us on the right path.

440
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,713
It will tell them what to hang on to.

441
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,820
We are only as great as
the story we leave behind.

442
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,013
Thank you!
