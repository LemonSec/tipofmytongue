2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,539
one of the kind? we agree.

3
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,510
The way you pursue your digital
ambitions is unique to you.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,180
It's so as your appetite for digital risk.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,360
Whether you're hyper
connecting your ecosystem,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,203
empowering a distributed workforce,

7
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:23,050
rapidly leveraging cloud, IoT,
AI or other new technologies,

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,040
RSA is here to help you
manage digital risk your way

9

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,392
So go ahead, be you.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,090
- [Instructor] Hello and welcome

I'd like to now turn it over

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,089
to Erwin Eimers for the presentation.

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,643
- Thank you.

21
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:05,821
My Name Is Erwin Eimers.

22
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,700
I'm the General Manager,

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,273
for the Regional Headquarters
in Americas Sumitomo Chemical,

24
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,360
and I basically fulfill two roles

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,702
besides heading up the
Regional Headquarters IT,

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,801
in the Americas for design

27
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:21,795
and implement regional shared services

28
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,360
for group companies in the Americas.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,010
I'm also a member of
Sumitomo Global IT committee

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,847
called the Global one team.

31
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:33,553
And there I helped develop
Global IT Standards and Services

32
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:35,917
and a Global IT

33
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,427
and Cyber Security roadmap
for Sumitomo Chemical.

34
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:46,320
Sumitomo chemical is a
group of separate companies

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,062
in five different sectors
with almost 33,000 employees.

36
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:53,593
The five sectors we operate in

37
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,686
is the Petrochemical and Plastics,

38
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,893
Energy and Functional Materials,

39
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,526
IT-related Chemicals,

40
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:03,280
Health and Crop Sciences
and Pharmaceuticals.

41
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,000
There's a long history of
the local group companies

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,312
to have independence and freedom.

43
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,049
The reason is they're
vastly different in size

44
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:18,886
and operating model and HPC

45
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,593
from the sector they operate in.

46
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:28,659
The Sumitomo Chemical board has decided

47
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,099
that Digital Innovation

48
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,379
is a "material issue" across all sectors

49
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,879
to create value in the future.

50
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:39,892
And as part of the Digital
Innovation Program,

51
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:42,843
everybody agreed that
more common platforms

52
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,572
need to be available and rolled out

53
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:48,157
throughout all the
Sumitomo Group Companies.

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,510
Now if you look at structure
of Sumitomo Chemical,

55
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,136
including the Americas region,

56
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,486
obviously we have resources

57
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:04,197
You see the five sectors on the right.

58
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,795
They each have a Global sector head,

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,210
and each of the group companies

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,943
has a president that
report to that sector head.

61
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,690
Besides those sectors,

62
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,680
there's also Corporate Planning and IT,

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,710
which has a Global head and gets ready,

64
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,007
the Americas Regional Headquarters.

65
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:32,240
There is also Legal and
Compliance Global Function

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,500
that the Americas Regional Legal

67
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,080
and Compliance reports to.

68
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,410
There's obviously more
corporate functions,

69
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,243
but these are the ones

70
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,023
that are in scope for this discussion.

71
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,250
So this is kind of the
situational overview.

72
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:56,644
There is definitely an increase
in Cyber Security threats,

73
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,790
and this has been acknowledged
by top management,

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,503
but also by the group Company.

75
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,500
We didn't do global IT training,

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,670
we agreed that the global
standards need to be established

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,887
or improved and forced to enforce the CIA.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,540
There is definitely a communication

79
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:27,718
gap between the Company's,
the Regional Headquarters,

80
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,888
and then the Headquarters
within the sector

81
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:33,037
as well as between the
corporate functions.

82
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,671
We also need to get acknowledgement

83
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,017
from the group Companies.

84
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,975
Cyber Security issues

85
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:49,950
that we're going to discuss

86
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,291
this hasn't really been an issue because

87
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,509
every single group Company in our region

88
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:00,070
has had an issue with Cyber Security,

89
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,320
Some kind of social engineering event

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,979
that has made them acknowledge

91
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,238
that this is something
that needs to be addressed.

92
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,409
Now the Autonomy of each
of the group companies

93
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,909
is very important,

94
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:17,560
because of the very different
sectors they operate in

95
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,314
and different type of
business model products

96
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:22,736
and customers they have.

97
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,513
We have for instance, manufacturing

98
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:29,097
and sales of chemical and
organic crop protection

99
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:30,349
and enhancement products.

100
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:35,120
We have soil health, public
health, forest health.

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,220
We even have manufacturing
plants where we develop

102
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,520
and manufacture automotive products,

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,219
car interiors, doors and trims, etc.

104
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,860
We make epitaxial wafers,
resorcinols that goes in tires,

105
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,009
wood adhesive, dyes,
super engineered plastics

106
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,580
with in-flight aerospace product,

107
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,980
Pyrethrum-based pest control products,

108
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,380
that are derived from plant.

109
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,425
So very different business point.

110
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,099
So, what we need is more common systems,

111
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,143
less Cyber Security incidents.

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,690
Tricks are we have, a limited IT resource

113
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,040
at the group company level,

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
because they have traditionally
smaller size companies

115
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,145
that operate under the
Sumitomo Chemical name.

116
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,380
So that means they have the same plan

117
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,330
as the large size company,

118
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,570
but the infrastructure of a
small company in some cases,

119
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,020
it's just the production
plant with 25-30 people

120
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,853
working on it

121
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,763
and IT is a handful of people.

122
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,797
We have some existing
regional services available.

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,855
They have traditionally
not been very successful,

124
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:02,605
the Global as well as
the Regional structure.

125
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:08,400
There's no less or no
Cyber Security skills

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,849
at the group company level.

127
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,521
And as I mentioned before,

128
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,621
the communication between the three layers

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,907
is not offload

130
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:21,979
the buy in from the group
companies for Global Services

131
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:28,650
it's not very good, just
the group company presidents

132
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,590
have been hesitant to buy in on those

133
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,609
because there's time
different, we keep a hand of it

134
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,063
and sometimes language barrier.

135
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:42,640
There is a lack of
understanding from corporate IT

136
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,382
about the group companies
business model or industry

137
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,549
and of course, the frequent upgrading.

138
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,420
So hopefully this gives you a
little bit of an introduction

139
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,280
and I'd like to talk about, the journey.

140
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,729
So with this task at hand,

141
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,640
I had to come up with an action plan

142
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,207
and the action plan for me was..

143
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,827
Let's look at the existing
services Globally and locally

144
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,210
and the lessons learned.

145
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,477
Let's really analyze the gaps

146
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,330
and confirm needs on group company level

147
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,433
that's developing the
security improvement plan

148
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,173
because the real focus is Cyber Security.

149
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,919
Lets make sure we get buy-ins

150
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,669
and acceptance and support

151
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,531
from Sumitomo Chemical group level

152
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:45,865
in a sloutly found in the
different group companies.

153
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,280
But the lessons learnt for me

154
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,300
were issues with the chief services

155
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,990
mainly because they were
infrastructure hosting services,

156
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,510
In privately owned Sumitomo data center,

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,863
so they were inflexible.

158
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,819
They weren't really cost-effective

159
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,803
for the smaller group companies.

160
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,938
(coughs)

161
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,690
Plus as I mentioned before,

162
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,805
the outsourcing model

163
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:20,573
was not really very popular
model by the group companies.

164
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,977
Because it is a..

165
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:28,193
To be honest, since the focus
really changed on security

166
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,904
and building out common systems,

167
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,810
the existing purpose is
worth addressing debt

168
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,250
and especially for the
group company presidents

169
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,925
CEO fraud whaling was
becoming very apparent

170
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,175
that everybody had some issues with it.

171
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,065
So, the Gap Analysis,

172
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:00,515
what was interesting if
we look at the existing

173
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,840
services and hosting, etc.

174
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,990
It was really focused on availability,

175
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,430
not much on confidentiality
and integrity at all,

176
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,430
and I believe that's where the
majority of the issues are.

177
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,032
Social engineering again, is not the best.

178
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,260
Deal to get was that so far
10 services either Globally

179
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,687
or Regionally were rolled out.

180
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,710
We're kind of enforced

181
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,393
and that does not create the buy-in.

182
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,589
So we...

183
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,642
We developed the plan,

184
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,980
which really had a need

185
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:51,310
to improve the Cyber
Security issues to come.

186
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,897
In order to make this
plan to become successful,

187
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:03,847
it needs to get buy-in
from group companies

188
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:06,264
as well as Headquarter level,

189
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:10,456
and therefore it needs to solve problems

190
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:14,706
for headquarters as well
as for the group company.

191
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:23,736
what we needed to do was get that buy-in

192
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:29,402
and so from Sumitomo
Chemical corporate level,

193
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,266
or Global level,

194
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,067
the way to get the buy-in

195
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,104
was tying in whatever regional solutions

196
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:41,104
we were presenting into
the Global IT roadmap,

197
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,537
creating a three tier responsibility model

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,840
where the group company
and regional Headquarters

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,983
as well as corporate,
IT had a responsibility.

200
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,310
In this way, everybody's involved,

201
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,319
it's not the outsourcing model

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,770
as much for the group company

203
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,543
and also it leaves the operational aspect

204
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:08,693
at group company level.

205
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:15,163
That must really be the goal
behind the actual model.

206
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,063
How do we get the buy-in
from the group companies?

207
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,933
For me it was to operate at regional level

208
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,780
not at Global level to create a committee

209
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,493
with the IT leads of
all the group companies

210
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,772
as well as with the president

211
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:40,323
and federal worker groups with them,

212
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,716
really understanding and
agree what their needs are,

213
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:46,622
and sometimes also pointing them out,

214
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,454
understand the culture

215
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,590
and coming up with solutions
that will fix the issues

216
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,907
in a way that they don't
feel the freedom to operate

217
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,938
and in a way that they're in control

218
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:06,378
and that was really by
creating transparency

219
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:10,419
on solution planning
and future roadmapping.

220
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,519
If we do the approach,

221
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:17,185
and we have responsibility
at all three levels,

222
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:21,926
and help with training and
standards to help them,

223
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,437
on expanding wide open.

224
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:27,854
Of course, the communicate,
communicate, communicate.

225
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,064
Now, what we did really was,

226
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:39,502
we implemented the Global multi-tenant,

227
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:42,339
Microsoft365 requirements,

228
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,880
which pretty created me
to be a much more improved

229
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,457
collaboration and information
sharing environment

230
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:52,140
between the group
Company and Headquarters,

231
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,616
which waited 10 before and it didn't work

232
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,010
because it was fully rolled out

233
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,843
and at least the proposal
was to be fully rolled out

234
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,375
and fully supported and managed perhaps.

235
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,560
In this case, we said
let's implement it jointly

236
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,386
between Headquarters,
Regional headquarters,

237
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:13,131
group Company IT attendive

238
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:15,467
and will talk this together

239
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:18,548
and will come up with
the rules of engagement,

240
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:19,890
and an escalation path

241
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,890
and also support availability
from Regional Headquarters

242
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,800
which is within their Americas region,

243
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,453
but there was no time different.

244
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,152
Our business hours or
their business hours,

245
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,613
which also fixed an issue for Headquarter.

246
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,447
We implemented a global MSS solution.

247
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,734
It's basically a SIEM service

248
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:48,567
as a managed service

249
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,862
and as a portal for group Company

250
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:54,612
as well as Regional Headquarters.

251
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,767
Hopefully that was in the
view of Cyber Security effect.

252
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:08,892
So we created the responsibility
for the group company

253
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,170
to act on any alerts or incidents,

254
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,536
that they have the
responsibility to report it

255
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,618
and to mediate incidents.

256
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:21,065
We have the responsibility
as Regional Headquarters

257
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,899
to assist them with it

258
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:25,380
and ultimately report it
up to the sector head.

259
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,650
We also created for certain companies

260
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:36,243
who felt the need for it,

261
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,370
to have some remediation services

262
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,523
and forensic services by a third party.

263
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
Headquarters really
had just the oversight,

264
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,069
they were receiving the alerts,

265
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,319
they can go into the portal

266
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:52,709
and they can just carry
out the oversite functions

267
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,030
to make sure that everything...

268
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,141
On a regional level we created
Cyber Security standards

269
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:07,411
for web facing, internet
facing and websites,

270
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,839
we eventually met the
Global Standard of all

271
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,840
web facing and internet-facing
system or changed standards.

272
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,171
We at regional level will make sure

273
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:28,117
those standards that are been followed

274
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:29,910
and we are now even working

275
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,079
on providing pen testing services

276
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,603
if each group company to get insight.

277
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,590
We created regionalized contents

278
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,440
for cyber Security Awareness training

279
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,990
and Phishing campaigns.

280
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,507
So, that is a service

281
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,411
that we do not have course
provided for the group company.

282
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,630
The results of the phishing
campaigns get shared

283
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,060
only with that group company.

284
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,976
Between the group companies
only aggregated for job

285
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:02,637
will be champions for the Headquarters.

286
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:06,069
You're gonna leave it
at the group company.

287
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,832
To get details, we just
provide the service.

288
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:12,473
And this was much more
acceptable for group company

289
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,329
than the way it was done before.

290
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,970
What we're working on now

291
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,203
is to come up with a global standard,

292
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,923
if you will, for endpoint
detection and remediation,

293
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,290
and probably combination of the two

294
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,040
and a service from a third party.

295
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,120
To have an equally designed

296
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,820
Endpoint Protection and remediate.

297
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,367
Because these are services
that group Companies,

298
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,500
can afford to do by themselves,

299
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,807
or even sometimes support the tool..

300
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:55,200
Most of the implemented tool

301
00:17:56,122 --> 00:18:00,003
they might not have the
people to really operate it.

302
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,559
We already talked about it a little bit

303
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,030
but how we implemented those two

304
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,459
to get the buy-in from the group companies

305
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,042
and three formulas.

306
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:22,188
As I said the common systems
there was Symantec MSS,

307
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:25,620
and that has now become
an ADM, Accenture service.

308
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,729
Microsoft365, we implemented
those completely jointly

309
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,480
within Headquarters..

310
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,830
Since these solved an issue on
multiple levels headquarters,

311
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,263
has been covering all
the implementation costs.

312
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,320
They have global pricing agreements

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,893
with Accenture and
Microsoft on the product.

314
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,320
So we do it best to charge

315
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,720
and so the group
companies leverage those..

316
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,953
those global pricing,

317
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,857
agreements which is
something they could not do,

318
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,980
Headquarters provides the
regular Microsoft365 support

319
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,663
but in case there is a need for emergency

320
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,010
support then regional headquarters...

321
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,890
So all services, their headquarters

322
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,580
or regional headquarters

323
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:38,629
is providing from a resource perspective,

324
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,317
those are all covered by the headquarters

325
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,867
if there's third party
costing for license perform,

326
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,084
then those will be passed on to me.

327
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,273
So one example I'd like to show is MSS.

328
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:57,877
So this is the symantec managed...

329
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,583
Two items implemented is

330
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,570
On the left you see the
group company environments.

331
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,530
They all tend to log to
America's local action point

332
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,470
which is managed by the
regional headquarters

333
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,770
we help implementing that.

334
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,600
The demand service is doing
all the threat aggregation

335
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,780
and consolidation and analysis.

336
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,990
And then sends alerts back in a portal

337
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:32,062
as well as through
email and text messages,

338
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:34,564
(coughs)

339
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:35,920
based on the severity level,

340
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,420
they go through company
the regional headquarters.

341
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,280
In this case, you see
there is the responsibility

342
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,503
on all three levels.

343
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,959
There is operationally no responsibility

344
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,980
or no involvement from group company

345
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:57,862
or regional headquarters,

346
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,740
and in this case,

347
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,149
we leave the corporate function

348
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,070
to no oversight function.

349
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,887
Regional Headquarters is
really operating in between

350
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,582
and the group companies

351
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,810
still stays operationally responsible,

352
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,720
but can get our assistance.

353
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,250
Regional Incident Response
Plan and pen testing

354
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,685
is something we're working on now.

355
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,518
So this is huge.

356
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,023
And what we're doing here

357
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:40,080
is we created with the Regional Legal

358
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,793
and compliance office.

359
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,046
An incident response
plan that we implement

360
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,049
at one group company first,

361
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,549
then we do a tabletop exercise

362
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:55,070
and then we roll it up to
the next group comprehend

363
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,210
each time we do a tabletop exercise,

364
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,154
we complete improvements.

365
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:00,660
Then will be implement

366
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,907
in all the incident response plans

367
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,070
for each tabletop exercise

368
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,550
to improve the incident response plan

369
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,710
for all the group companies.

370
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,907
This is another step..

371
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:26,799
So, in summary,

372
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,900
and by the way, if
there are any questions,

373
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,193
please reach out to me
on slider.. available.

374
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,163
So, as a summary, I would say,

375
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,850
given the current needs,

376
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,984
the direction from the board
and the available resources

377
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,283
at the group company level

378
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,820
get services really Were the right answer

379
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,523
to successfully address issues and needs

380
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,007
and wanted at some
level, and individually,

381
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,873
companies wouldn't have
been able to resolve it.

382
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,230
To roll it out as a Global
service from Headquarters

383
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,567
would not have been

384
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,949
would not have traded right.

385
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:29,138
The lessons learned are very important

386
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:34,138
to figure out what did not work..so far.

387
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,008
Analyze the gift to need some local level

388
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,187
was really important

389
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:44,820
because it really make sure we
focus on on the right things

390
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,246
and it also shows that
we're really interested

391
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:55,644
in your gifts and meet and
love the corporate planet.

392
00:23:57,821 --> 00:23:59,515
The plans have to be prioritized

393
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:02,099
and effectively list realistic.

394
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:06,747
Sometimes, large companies like ours,

395
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:10,490
create a big plan,
create big project teams

396
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,860
and just roll it out all over the globe,

397
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
and in this case, we would never
have the direct engagement.

398
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,310
So we have to do with realistic steps

399
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,929
that are the right size

400
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,970
for what we have.

401
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,980
And there has to be that tie

402
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,453
in the spine on both levels.

403
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:35,404
The solutions need to tie

404
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:40,195
to the global IT roadmap,

405
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,490
and I'm also part of the global team

406
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,194
either put inside this...

407
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:49,240
and then of course, the
communication function.

408
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,260
A lot of times the Regional Headquarters

409
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,170
that we created this truly a function

410
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,850
that communicates up and down

411
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,860
to keep that information
flowing from group Companies up

412
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,110
and from Headquarters up.

413
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,480
There was a real need for
improvement in security,

414
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,690
there was effect.

415
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:19,429
Outsourcing was just not
the right fit in our culture

416
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,937
where it doesn't fit,
freedom or cooperate.

417
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:27,829
Some common systems and
standards when needed

418
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,662
and also accepted, nobody
disagreeing with it.

419
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,312
And training and testing,

420
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,280
just to provide training and testing

421
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:42,632
and get the results is good

422
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:45,282
when a company creates a lot of

423
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:49,948
value and also accountability
back to the group company.

424
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,470
And then the multi-tier, support model

425
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,860
and communication function we've provided

426
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:01,300
has really done..

427
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,260
Last but not least,

428
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,770
I would say, the questions I have,

429
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:18,199
I also would like to ask you
if you are in a similar..

430
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:26,783
really addressing the issues?

431
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,216
do we really understand what is needed

432
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:35,123
from a shared service?

433
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:36,524
Is it the right model?

434
00:26:36,524 --> 00:26:37,357
you'll start pieces,

435
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:39,673
you want to leave it to company levels?

436
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:42,073
for pieces he wants to
leave it at profit level?

437
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,940
Are we trying to do too much, right?

438
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,060
Do things right and a lot
of things so much right.

439
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,887
If you can't deliver,

440
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:54,909
its very hard to get a second hand

441
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:58,950
and really try to approach it

442
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,114
from group Company president level.

443
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:06,790
Ts it a service I would buy
from another third party

444
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,220
Is it priced Right?

445
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:16,080
And and the other piece
how do I know My services?

446
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,050
So I made clear agreements

447
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,950
with all the group company presidents,

448
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,593
.....from time to best measurement,

449
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:26,703
year from now we'll
look at that just great,

450
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:30,811
and we can we can discuss this.

451
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:34,810
So agreements on what success looks like

452
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,547
and how it's being measured is important.

453
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:43,595
And tivity feedback will be
those repeated conversation,

454
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:49,741
our present level, and we're proofs of it.

455
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:54,030
And bring up very valuable information

456
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,940
that I didn't share with group company.

457
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,620
And there are a few minutes left

458
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,830
so please go into slider
with any more question

459
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,563
and this was the end of my questions.

460
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,397
Thank you.
