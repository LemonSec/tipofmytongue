this session.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,420
My name is Senthil Ramakrishnan,

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,520
and I am part of the AT&T
business organization,

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,950
specific in the IoT organization.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,160
Thanks again for joining
and as Rita mentioned,

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,839
if you have any questions,
or any of the discussions

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,590
you'd like to have
reach out to our slider.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,590
Over the next 30 minutes,
we are going to be talking

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,617
about IoT.

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,200
Some of the security
challenges that IoT deployments

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,530
face today, specifically
on the device side,

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,350
and then we will focus on how
5G and some of the 5G network

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,690
capabilities will help solve
some of these IoT challenges.

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,220
And again, we're gonna
be focusing specifically

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,987
on devices and challenges that they face.

25
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,320
So we'll start off by
talking about what is IoT.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,399
This is a term, this is
another industry buzzword,

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,630
that probably everybody
on this presentation

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,979
or the sessions have heard.

29
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,910
IoT or internet of things
really is just a network

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,179
of connected devices,
devices that are deployed out

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,200
in the field that are
collecting information,

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,910
in terms of information
and sending it back

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,130
for post processing, by applications.

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,240
These applications might then
take some acts, some decision

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,140
and then force some action
through some random control using

36
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,530
the same devices themselves.

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,530
So there's been an explosion
of IoT in the last few years.

38
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,437
Today, I think the estimate
is around 2.5 billion devices,

39
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:23,757
IoT devices deployed
globally on various types

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,207
of connectivity.

41
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,540
The growth is expected to be
much larger numbers anywhere

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,060
between 20 to 50 billion
IoT devices over the next

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,800
five to seven years are expected.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,600
That's a huge group, but
the thing we have to realize

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,680
is not all IoT devices are
the same, and we'll start off

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,083
with something as simple
as the connectivity piece.

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,240
When IoT was starting
to grow a few years ago,

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,083
about there were 70 to
75% of these IoT devices,

49
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,250
were expected to be on Wi-Fi.

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,660
But as these devices
started getting deployed,

51
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,770
mainly because Wi-Fi is
cheap, is easily available,

52
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,520
easy to deploy.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,900
But what was happening was
there is no inherent security,

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,750
built with Wi-Fi and
enterprises were starting to see

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,410
that IoT deployments were very vulnerable

56
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,130
when they were using Wi-Fi.

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,191
And so cellular IoT
started gaining traction,

58
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:25,900
and it's going to continue
to gain traction as well.

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,150
So today, it's nearly around
10 to 15%, and that's expected

60
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,710
to grow up to 25%.

61
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,760
And with the advent of the
introduction of technologies

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,813
like LTE-M, Narrowband IoT and 5G,

63
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,739
that traction for cellular
IoT is gonna continue...

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,420
Now, before we jump into the
challenges that IoT brings,

65
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,343
let's talk about the IoT architecture.

66
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,040
Very simply, you can break
it down into three layers.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,829
One is the device layer,
the connectivity layer,

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,130
and then the data and application layer.

69
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,350
The device layer is any IoT
device, could be something

70
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,720
as complex as a smart
building or a connected car,

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,670
or it could be something as
simple as a temperature sensor

72
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,220
or a flow sensor out in the oil field.

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,450
So, all of these IoT, all of
these different types of IoTs

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,380
comprises this layer.

75
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,480
Now, a lot of these devices
have connectivity directly built

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,180
into them, but some of
them also have a gateway

77
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,530
in between that these
devices are talking through.

78
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,619
The next layer is the connectivity layer,

79
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,950
or the connectivity layer is
essentially the transport layer

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,409
that is going to carry
the data from your device

81
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,260
to your back-end application.

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,020
And this could be cellular,
I'm talking about Wi-Fi,

83
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,710
it could be wireline, satellite,
all types of connectivity,

84
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,440
it could be private,
public to wide range there.

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,180
Now, these networks of
carrying this data back

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,037
to the set of platforms or
applications that are sitting

87
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,740
in the back-end, and these
platforms and applications

88
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,900
are broken down into three.

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,530
There's an application
enablement platform,

90
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,765
which is essentially the Azure, the AWS

91
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:14,419
and any of the Google's, any
of these cloud providers,

92
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,630
where you can run your application.

93
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,240
The second is your connectivity
management platform,

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,900
which is what you use to manage
how your devices connect.

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,120
And the last one is the
device management platform,

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,514
which is what you use to
manage your devices itself.

97
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:31,176
And you put all of these
together and you get

98
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,676
the IoT ecosystem.

99
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,926
Now, where are we with
IoT in the real world?

100
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:40,640
The IoT is essentially
everywhere you look,

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,500
any industry whether it's
some of the older industries

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,160
like manufacturing, industrial
to newer industries,

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,500
like drones, agriculture,
wearables, healthcare,

104
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
any essential industry today
has some type of IoT deployment

105
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:57,657
available.

106
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,370
And the rate of deployment
is continuing to grow,

107
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,310
because at the end of the
day, the more data you have,

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,360
the more educated decisions
and actions you can take

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,490
and IoT is gonna enable that.

110
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,300
So really, the application
of IoT is very widespread,

111
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,123
and new applications are
coming out as we speak.

112
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,113
Now, let's get to the interesting part.

113
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:28,099
Now we have a good northeasterly
introduction to IoT.

114
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,440
Let's try to understand what
the security challenges are.

115
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,130
Now the first thing to really
understand is IoT is very

116
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,580
different from IT.

117
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,810
We're gonna spend some
time really understanding

118
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,840
what those differences are,
because those are gonna

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,017
define what the threat vectors

120
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,810
and the security challenges
really available.

121
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,150
Now if you look at the same model,

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,049
where we have the three layers,
the device, the network,

123
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,240
and the application, you'll
see that there's a way

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,163
set of vulnerabilities and
compromise that can happen.

125
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,470
But the challenge with IoT is
that, although you can secure

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,080
your back-end application,
because it's really running

127
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,650
in one of the cloud
providers, and we have a lot

128
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,419
of solutions out there.

129
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,510
And it's connecting or and
you could connect using

130
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,510
one of the more secure
connectivity options like cellular,

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,420
when you come down with the device,

132
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,610
that is where the challenge arises.

133
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,140
Because most IoT devices
are going to be really

134
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,630
low powered devices that
don't have a lot of processing

135
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,890
or memory capability on them.

136
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,700
So the ability to add
security capabilities

137
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,159
to these low power devices,
is a big challenge.

138
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,000
The second is that these
devices are very cheap,

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,770
so you're not gonna be able to
add cost to it by increasing

140
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,890
security capabilities on them.

141
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,330
So that's probably the
number one challenge

142
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,099
or security gap for IoT is
the device and its ability

143
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,373
to be secured by itself.

144
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,260
So let's talk how that
impacts IoT security.

145
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,440
So let's talk about volume.

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,396
Let's take the example
of a car manufacturer

147
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:24,190
as an example enterprise for this IoT.

148
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,680
So a car manufacturer will
have multiple IoT applications,

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,420
it could be something to monitor their

150
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,730
industrial manufacturing
plants, asset tracking,

151
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,140
worker tracking, it could be
the connected cars themselves

152
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,960
that are offering as a
service to their customers.

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,460
So there's gonna be a
large volume of IoT devices

154
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,750
that are going to be
deployed out in the field,

155
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,624
and all of these devices
are going to be different.

156
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:53,320
They're gonna be deployed
in various environments,

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,337
in various geo locations,
and each of these devices

158
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,530
are gonna be different
in sensor that is sitting

159
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,964
and measuring the temperatures
inside your factory,

160
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:07,500
or the critical component in
the factory is gonna be very

161
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,070
different from the sensor
device that is inside your

162
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,210
connected car.

163
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,840
So there's gonna be a wide
variety of custom devices really,

164
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,910
that are deployed out into the field.

165
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,620
Now the challenge this
raises is that you cannot

166
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,470
have a singular or common
security solution that can be used

167
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,180
to secure all of these devices.

168
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,870
Now we talked about these
custom devices, and that extends

169
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,040
really both into the
hardware and software world.

170
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,097
Because you're gonna have
custom hardware built

171
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:41,650
either by a tier one or you're
buying it off of the shelf

172
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,570
and putting it together,
like a system integrator

173
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,490
type model.

174
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,200
And the software for IoT
is completely different,

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,670
because real time operating systems,

176
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,420
there's not a lot of use of
standard operating systems

177
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,199
like Windows or MacOS, or even Android.

178
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,980
These are very real time operating systems

179
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,383
for smaller devices and then
Unix and Linux meetings across

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,923
the rest of the ecosystem.

181
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:11,290
There's a lot of effort to
try to unify that, but even

182
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,969
today, it's very split, very fragmented.

183
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,200
So again, the challenge
that this brings forth

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,970
is how do I manage these devices?

185
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,210
How do I maintain the security
lifecycle for all of these

186
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,043
devices?

187
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:24,040
That's very difficult.

188
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,839
You can't use your standard,
device management solutions

189
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,010
that you use for your IT
devices, your laptops,

190
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,533
your phones, none of those
are gonna work in this case.

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,720
And then device access
is another challenge.

192
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,690
IoT devices are gonna
be almost like a deploy

193
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,650
and forget type model where
the device is out in the field.

194
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,140
And in lots of cases, a lot of
verticals like smart cities,

195
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,710
these places are available
in public spaces,

196
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,860
can be the Smart Lighting System, etc.

197
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,767
That has connectivity back
into the cities IT systems.

198
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:03,260
And now, these devices could
then be easily accessible,

199
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,200
and if not secured properly,
easily compromised,

200
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,097
which would then allow access
back into the interfaces,

201
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:11,350
and to systems and back-ends.

202
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,370
So, in a traditional IT
system, the risks are really

203
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,850
data loss and compromise of
data and leading to some lost

204
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,520
revenue and resources.

205
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,731
Like with IoT, those risks are
amplified because depending

206
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:30,150
on the vertical that
has also impacted life.

207
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,150
Now, you could take Thomas
driving as an example,

208
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,970
even something as simple
as industrial systems

209
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,100
could be compromising me
to malfunction and in fact,

210
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,200
work and safety in that location as well.

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
So IoT brings some unique
challenges that are exacerbated

212
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,920
by the inability to fully
secure these devices.

213
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,360
So how do we go about
securing these devices?

214
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
That's what we're gonna talk about next.

215
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,050
So what we recommend really
is a multi-layered approach

216
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,050
to security, you have these three layers,

217
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,980
and we have to have security solutions

218
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,270
in all of these three layers.

219
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,180
We have to have threat
management that looks

220
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,520
at the ecosystem end-to-end.

221
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,890
But the problem, as I was
talking about earlier,

222
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,480
is that these devices are
not able to have a full

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,660
SWOT of security solutions
deployed normally.

224
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,480
Today most of these security
solutions are sitting

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,300
at the very end, on the
opposite end of ecosystem,

226
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,120
meaning they're all sitting
at the data application layer.

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,960
So these devices are
essentially open and vulnerable,

228
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,640
and all protection are made
to the data that's coming in

229
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,077
at their application layer.

230
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,740
And that obviously is not a good solution,

231
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,320
because that is a weak
link in the entire chain.

232
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,610
So this is where 5G comes in.

233
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,610
5G brings about a new set
of capabilities that allows

234
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,689
the enterprise to bring
security solutions closer

235
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,810
to the device.

236
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,053
So even though the devices
continue to stay low powered,

237
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,897
and possibly insecure,
your ability to bring

238
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:22,130
the security applications
and security solutions

239
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,130
at the edge of the network
allows us to provide a better

240
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,319
risk level to your enterprises.

241
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,130
Thereby even though that
is some security issues

242
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,900
in the end-to-end solution,
your risk is now at a much more

243
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,079
acceptable level and so
you can be more confident

244
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,223
in deploying your IoT
solution into the market.

245
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,950
So I'm gonna stop there and
feel free to send any questions

246
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,750
regarding IoT and IoT
security wireless via slide,

247
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,900
and I'm going to
transition over to 5G part

248
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,123
of this discussion as well.

249
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,829
So let's talk about 5G and how
it's going to help the issues

250
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,533
that we talked about with IoT devices.

251
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,950
So what does 5G bring?

252
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,880
5G, again, is another term that
we're hearing in the market

253
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,363
every day, and how is it gonna help IoT?

254
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,730
I want to point out a few
capabilities that are gonna

255
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,870
be important from a security
perspective later on.

256
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,906
First one is ultra low latency.

257
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,959
5G is gonna bring less than 20 millisecond

258
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,440
round trip latency between
your device and your back-end

259
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,450
application.

260
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,500
Well, that's important
because today, on 4G LTE,

261
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,200
that latency can be anywhere
between 75 to 150 milliseconds

262
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
depending on where your devices.

263
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,870
And latency is important,
we'll talk about it later.

264
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,500
The second one is reliability,
your ability to support

265
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,900
mission critical devices when
they're out in the field,

266
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,120
reliably and high availability
is very triggered.

267
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,343
It's important from a
security perspective as well.

268
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,960
Next one is we talked about
the volume of IoT devices.

269
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,860
5G supports massive IoT, where
you can have a very large

270
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,940
number of IoT devices in
very dense deployments

271
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,103
because of small cells
and other capabilities

272
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,630
that 5G brings.

273
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,250
And then some IoT applications
or verticals require

274
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,943
ultra high bandwidth as well, so 5G brings

275
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:37,310
that to the market as well.

276
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,109
Continuing, when you compare 4G to 5G,

277
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,930
5G is an instance transformation,

278
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,630
that means from the devices
through the network all the way

279
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,170
to the back-end, everything
is completely changed.

280
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,880
We talked about the radio access part,

281
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,770
which is the low latency,
the ultra high speed,

282
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,970
massive densification but
it also brings some other

283
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,273
capabilities that we're
gonna jump into next.

284
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,950
So two things that 5G
really brings to the market

285
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,209
when you look at the
architecture, two massive changes

286
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,220
that are brought about in 5G deployment.

287
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,600
First one is virtualization.

288
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,760
Moving from 4G to 5G,
we're essentially moving

289
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,400
to a software defined
network based architecture

290
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,870
for the entire 5G network.

291
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,010
Now this is groundbreaking
because this SDN based

292
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,939
architecture allows us to
do some very critical things

293
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,890
with respect to security and resources.

294
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,949
And we'll talk about that next as well.

295
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,580
The other change that 5G also
brings about is the separation

296
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,503
of your control and user plane.

297
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,599
This is called CUPS, Control
and User Plane Separation.

298
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,420
And what this does is it really separates

299
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,829
the network management capable functions

300
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,840
from the user functions
meaning the actual data

301
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,810
that is being carried between the device

302
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,300
and the back-end application.

303
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,619
Now, this is important because
from a security perspective,

304
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,489
now you can have separate
security policy for your

305
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,660
control plane as well as your user plane.

306
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,849
And that is important because
these devices will be using

307
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:19,679
the user plane, and
having the ability to add

308
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,440
security policy to it becomes critical,

309
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,670
because now you're adding
security layers and helping

310
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,083
protect that vulnerable.

311
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,820
The other changes which
are just as important,

312
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,169
is this move from a
centralized network core

313
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,474
to a highly distributed network core.

314
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:46,010
So that plays into the
high reliability and high

315
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,623
availability feature like 5G.

316
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,430
The other important
and very important part

317
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,347
of the 5G network is the
addition of the edge.

318
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:59,600
Now we talked about how today
most of the security solutions

319
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:05,060
are running at the end of the
IoT ecosystem, which is really

320
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,080
the application in the data.

321
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,220
Now, the addition of
this edge to the network

322
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,000
has two things, one is
now you're able to add

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,770
network security capabilities,

324
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,940
this is the network itself,
those can be added to the edge.

325
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,940
And you can also bring user
or device security services

326
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,053
to the edge as well.

327
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,330
As other improvements to the
5G technology, which includes

328
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,290
increase or the add and
user friendly encryption

329
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,290
of the traffic, and also
some subscriber privacy

330
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,780
and identity changes as well.

331
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,780
So overall, the 5G evolution
on the 5G advancement really

332
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,017
brings protections to the network layer,

333
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,710
and that fixes some of the vulnerabilities

334
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,120
that were uncovered in 4G LTE.

335
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,500
Now this is separate from
what we're gonna talk about

336
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,760
in the application layer, which
is what is actually really

337
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
to protecting these IoT devices.

338
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,889
We talked about, the
Subscriber Identity Privacy,

339
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,360
we talked about some
additional security functions

340
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,310
that are introduced into the network.

341
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,649
Some verticals in IoT really
have devices that are moving

342
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,380
around, in many cases,
moving networks as well.

343
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,000
An example is, containers,
tracking containers,

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,720
refrigerated containers.

345
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,667
So in these cases, you're moving networks,

346
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,949
you're moving geographic
locations, and so 5G brings

347
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,050
around security when you cross
network boundaries as well.

348
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:44,320
And other change to the
5G security architecture

349
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,250
was the introduction of domains.

350
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,770
They've really created a
hierarchy within the architecture

351
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,040
when you have a network
access the security domain,

352
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,000
which is really how your
device is authorized

353
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,490
and gets access into the network.

354
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,400
You have a network domain
security which is how,

355
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,180
which is some of the
things we talked about,

356
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,330
which is how the network itself is secured

357
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,649
with the communication
between the infrastructure.

358
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,883
And then two important things
is the user domain security

359
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:14,240
from the application domain security.

360
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,390
This is where the user traffic,

361
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,190
and the application traffic itself

362
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,080
are able to be secured

363
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,210
by additional services
that came into this.

364
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:30,719
Now let's talk about the user
and the application domain.

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,170
So two things that really,
really stand out to me,

366
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,839
one is network virtualization,
and edge based security.

367
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,190
Network virtualization really
means most of the network

368
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,450
components are SDN based.

369
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,450
So now, what you can do is
allocate resources based on need

370
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,860
for each of these network infrastructure.

371
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,019
So essentially, you could
create a slice throughout

372
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,270
the network, end-to-end in the network,

373
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,470
and dedicate that slice
to specific IoT use cases,

374
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,426
we'll talk about that later.

375
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,760
Edge based security, we
talked about it moving

376
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,960
the applications and services,

377
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,320
specifically device security
applications and services,

378
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
as close to the device as possible is now

379
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,543
a feature that 5G networks are principled.

380
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,463
So, slicing.

381
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,910
Now, as we talked about
all the different verticals

382
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,470
with IoT security or with
IoT, you'll see that not all

383
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,853
of these verticals are the same.

384
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:38,543
Economists levels might
require high bandwidth higher,

385
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:41,270
low latency and high security.

386
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:46,040
But as industrial type
deployment which does not require

387
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,473
high latency or high
throughput would still require,

388
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,100
security policy.

389
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,673
And so each IoT vertical might
have it's own requirements,

390
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:01,760
and so with virtualization,
we're able to take the network

391
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,760
and slice it into different
network slices so that you can

392
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,884
use those and base your
resources on what is actually

393
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:12,717
needed.

394
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:13,550
And so in this example, we're talking

395
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,070
about a transport layer,
where we have low latency,

396
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,560
high bandwidth and high security.

397
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,190
Same thing for healthcare,
but you might not need

398
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,620
high bandwidth in the healthcare scenario,

399
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,290
so standard bandwidth could be used.

400
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,110
So, slicing is important for
devices, because now you can

401
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,709
take insecure devices
and put them on a slice

402
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,120
where they will not impact
other devices that are doing

403
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,762
mission critical capabilities.

404
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:47,762
Likes of healthcare, for example,
devices that are insecure

405
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,679
can be put into say
that a healthcare slice

406
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,680
that does not cross into
other mission critical

407
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,760
and insecure devices.

408
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,217
So that's why slicing plays
a very important role.

409
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:06,366
Next, when we get to security at the edge,

410
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:09,850
this is where some pretty
interesting things can happen.

411
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,069
So over the past decade,
really, we've been talking about

412
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:17,180
moving applications to the
cloud, it was easy to do,

413
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,190
it's cheaper, it's standardized,
you can go build your

414
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,260
applications to have them move around,

415
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,740
move them around to different clouds.

416
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,160
So that move to the clouds
has been very popular over

417
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,160
the last decade, but now with
the introduction of the edge,

418
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,094
that is this new
decentralization of the cloud

419
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:36,400
that is happening.

420
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,300
You don't have to move your applications

421
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,169
or keep your applications in
any high latency scenario,

422
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,320
when the edge allows you
to perform those actions

423
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,370
much quicker.

424
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,658
So I want to introduce two
terms, decision latency,

425
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,995
and actions latency.

426
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,660
And it's important in the
IoT security use case,

427
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,940
because when you have things like AI

428
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,010
or machine learning based
threat detection running

429
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,440
at an edge, and you identify
and compromise device

430
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,283
or a scenario, which needs
to be a security scenario

431
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,780
that needs to be rectified immediately,

432
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,790
you have that low latency,
and that low decision latency

433
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,807
to be able to get that
data and make that decision

434
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,600
and then take action that
you're not sending data

435
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,807
all the way back to the
cloud, before you make

436
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,483
the decision and then take that action.

437
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:30,629
And you have multiple edges
in the 5G world as well,

438
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,700
you have a mobile edge,
which is at the center

439
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,870
of the network.

440
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,496
So that's could be even
deployed on premise,

441
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:39,330
you have a network edge,
which is within the network

442
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,199
or inside the network core as well.

443
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,290
So depending on your application,
depending on your latency

444
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,010
to see requirements, you could
run your services in either

445
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,150
of these entities.

446
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,490
So examples of security
IoT security services

447
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,230
that can be done that is device identity,

448
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,123
like when you have things
like Narrowband IoT devices,

449
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,830
which have very low bandwidth use cases.

450
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,000
And so you can have a very
heavy authentication algorithm

451
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,600
running all the way back to
the cloud, before you let

452
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,250
that device onto the network.

453
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,140
I just want to wake up five times a day,

454
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,740
and send two kilobits of
data, that's my use case.

455
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,730
But I still need to be secure,

456
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,480
so running some of these services,

457
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,990
these authentication device
identity services at the edge

458
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,915
allows you to do that.

459
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,940
So again, depending on your
application and services,

460
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,400
you have a lot of areas where
you can deploy these security

461
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,233
services.

462
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,117
And this is just an
illustration of that security

463
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,740
at the edge.

464
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,650
When you have a very
type of device deployment

465
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,380
for your IoT ecosystem, you
could use the edge to set up

466
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,040
device adapters, so at
the edge application,

467
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,430
your security application,
could opt to any variety

468
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,920
of devices, without having to
worry about protocols, etc.

469
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,920
So again, we're taking away
that challenge of an idea

470
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,060
of devices.

471
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,010
We're taking away the challenge
that all these devices

472
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,350
cannot be managed by a single application,

473
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,540
because now you're moving
those applications more

474
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,620
to the cloud.

475
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,360
And you can also run these
device adaptor services

476
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,459
at the cloud as well .

477
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,139
Now, we were all familiar
with the zero trust security

478
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,940
model, and because of this
virtualization network slicing

479
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,380
the ability to use the edge to
limit access to the back-end,

480
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,150
you can now deploy this zero
trust security model much more

481
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,003
simpler and much more
quicker with with 5G.

482
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,230
Now all your devices do
not have to talk back

483
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,640
to the back-end application,
you don't have to open up your

484
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,260
firewalls, to 10 20 million
devices that are out

485
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,093
in the field.

486
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:48,510
You can now limit that to a
small set of edge based devices

487
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,900
or edge based gateways,
that are communicating

488
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,040
to your back-end.

489
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,149
These obviously, these edge
gateways are a lot more powerful

490
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,190
and can have a lot more
security capabilities

491
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,140
and services event.

492
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,140
So, we have a table that we
looked at in the beginning,

493
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,450
and we take a look at that
same table and compare

494
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,450
it to what 5G can do.

495
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,570
So the large volumes
and the different types,

496
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,669
we talked about using
network slices to divvy up

497
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,563
how those devices can connect
to the network more sources

498
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:19,590
that can get access to,
we can use device adapters

499
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,500
and edge based solutions to
manage all of these devices.

500
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,080
And of course, you can
reduce your risk again,

501
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,580
by enabling network
slicing, and then enabling

502
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,750
security capabilities at
the edge on the system.

503
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,010
So you put all of this together,

504
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,780
and what you have is an
edge based, virtualized,

505
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,930
automated security control
capability that you can deploy.

506
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,720
With the advancements in machine learning,

507
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,560
and threat detection that
are happening in the industry

508
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,210
today, moving those closer to
the device, and using those

509
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,060
to protect the device before
they can impact anything

510
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,529
on the downstream and any of
the services on the downstream

511
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,330
becomes very important.

512
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,893
And enabling that zero trust
environment is also critical.

513
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,330
One thing we all have to remember is that,

514
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,110
at the end of the day,
even though 5G brings

515
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,850
these new capabilities, it is
still a shared security model.

516
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,917
The network is still not
going to be able to protect

517
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,659
the entire ecosystem.

518
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,580
So we must ensure that we have,
that we take responsibility

519
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,850
for the entire into an ecosystem,

520
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,857
and ensure that that is
influencing the insecurity

521
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,360
before we can deploy.

522
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,250
And that's my last message
for your takeaways,

523
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,143
for this session.

524
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,490
So before you start looking
at what IoT deployments

525
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,680
you're ready to make, the
first thing you need to really

526
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,570
understand is how
significantly different IoT

527
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,423
is from existing IT systems.

528
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,320
That understanding is
very critical to ensuring

529
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,929
that you are able to
identify the security gaps,

530
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,143
and the risks that IoT
brings to your investments.

531
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,780
Understanding the capabilities
that 5G brings to the table

532
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,430
is important, because the
5G is gonna be an essential

533
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,843
tool that is gonna help you
secure your IoT ecosystem.

534
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,990
Once you start and get into
the architecture stage,

535
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,380
take a look at your
specific IoT deployment,

536
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,920
what its security needs are,
what the network capabilities

537
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,390
if it requires and then
define what the IoT solutions

538
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,840
that can be used to deploy.

539
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,540
Like, you have to perform
a risk assessment first

540
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,320
to understand what the
risk this deployment brings

541
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
to you're own enterprise.

542
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,399
And then based on the security
solutions you're deploying,

543
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,377
you can then define what the
acceptable risk level is.

544
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:46,696
And that's going to
depend really on your cost

545
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:47,980
and the capabilities.

546
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,930
Then once you deploy, you
have to continue to monitor

547
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,050
and manage the security
of the entire ecosystem,

548
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,300
and 5G again, that user
domain or application domain

549
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,909
allows you to continuously
improve your security policies

550
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,780
that you're applying to your devices.

551
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,050
Now you can also run testing
and audit capabilities

552
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,383
at the edge as well, so a
lot of capabilities there.

553
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,899
That's the presentation, I
do hope that the presentation

554
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,290
has been useful for you.
