1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:02,962
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,520
- There is so much room left
to innovate in our space.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,700
And I'm hoping over this week
those of you that are here,

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,550
those of you that are attending
virtually get inspired,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,973
inspired on how you can
contribute to security.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,189
And I wanna also begin by acknowledging

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,070
that we did have a virtual
innovation sandbox in 2021.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,539
How many people attended the
virtual innovation sandbox?

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,640
(audience clapping)

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,190
Come on, I know.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,430
Okay, a few people.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,950
Okay, fine, fine.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,623
I'm not gonna take it personally.

14
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,187
It was good, it was good.

15
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,110
It was not as good as
this, but it was good.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,163
It was virtual, amazing companies.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,660
And I wanted to allow the winner

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,660
of the 2021 Innovation Sandbox competition

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,860
to come up here and be recognized

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,179
because it was a real,
really tough competition.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,250
Lots of, you know, lots
of amazing companies.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,250
And so without any
further ado, let us roll

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,750
the winner announcement, go back in time

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,750
and acknowledge our 2021
Innovation Sandbox winner.

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,373
Roll the tape.

26
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:31,110
(drumroll rolling)

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,110
Paul, who is the winner

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,880
of Innovation Sandbox

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,830
at RSA Conference 2021

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,763
Virtual Edition, Paul?

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,000
- The judges are really
pleased to announce

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,012
this year's winner is Apiiro.

33
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:57,845
(energetic music)

34
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:04,746
- And we have our winner
here with us, Idan.

35
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,335
Come on up, come on up.

36
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,167
(audience clapping)

37
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,990
Good, congratulations, man.

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,949
We had to give you time on the stage.

39
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,782
- Thank you, thank you.

40
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,263
Thank you very much.
- How's everything?

41
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,340
- Exciting, a lot of progress and-

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
- Good, well, first give us
a one sentence of Apiiro.

43
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,113
What does Apiiro do?

44
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,550
- So we secure the entire
software supply chain

45
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,600
from design, development, and deliver.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,810
Apiiro basically helps security teams

47
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,040
and developers proactively fix risks

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,620
in their cloud native applications

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,370
before delivering to the cloud.

50
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,823
- Wow, man, very timely, very timely.

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,410
And so talk to me about what's happened

52
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,390
since the innovation sandbox.

53
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,082
- Everything changed.

54
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:54,560
- Right, this is some serious.
- We built-

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,300
We built a top-notch team.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,122
We grew the business by 398%.

57
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:04,028
- 398%?
- Yeah, small, small growth.

58
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,130
(audience clapping)

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,329
We took it from 20 people
to 90, across the globe.

60
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,440
We have amazing customers
from small shops,

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,803
like 50 developers, to 25,000 developers.

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,540
We contributed to NIST,

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,660
to the security software
development framework,

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,183
and to the software bill
of materials standards.

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,270
We found some interesting zero-day

66
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,430
software supply chain vulnerability.

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,480
- Responsibly disclosed, I assume.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,744
- Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

69
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,120
- Okay, okay, just checking, yeah.

70
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,290
- We worked with them,
and we helped them fix it.

71
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,900
And we launched our
partner program last week

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,840
with Google, HashiCorp,
NetSPI, and other big names.

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,940
- Fantastic.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,370
Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,000
I wanted you to have your moment on stage.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,480
And bring the photographer.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,715
Come on, man, we gotta do
a dramatic reenactment.

78
00:03:57,716 --> 00:03:59,750
(audience clapping)
Apiiro.

79
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,258
- Thank you very much.

80
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,760
(audience clapping)

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,825
- Thanks, Idan, thanks
so much for being here.

82
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,408
(upbeat music)
