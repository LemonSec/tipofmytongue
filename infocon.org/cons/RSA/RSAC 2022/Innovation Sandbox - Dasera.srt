(calm music)

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,830
- Helping cloud first organizations

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,200
operationalize data governance.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,200
Please welcome Co-Founder
of Dasera, David McCaw.

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:20,697
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:24,477
(audience clapping)

7
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:25,480
Hey David, welcome.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,636
- Thank you.

9
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:27,468
- How are you?

10
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,302
- Good.

11
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:32,423
- [Host] All right, your
time begins right now.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,960
- So there are two sides to every coin,

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,610
we all understand the
importance of protecting data,

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,820
but at the same time

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,370
our businesses are more
dependent on data than ever

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,120
and speed is everything.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,492
We can't let security
get in the way, right?

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,410
So if we take a look at this picture

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,650
this might look familiar.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,400
Today, teams that are involved

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,839
with protecting data operate in silos.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,150
The fact that there's
very little context shared

23
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,269
creates a variety of problems,

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,510
slow and manual processes,

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,320
false positives,

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,300
intrusive solutions
that don't get adoption,

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,800
and inaccurate attestations.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,320
This needs to be solved and
that's why Dasera is here.

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,279
What we're doing is we're
providing organizations

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
with a continuous context layer

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,640
that allows them to build
security and compliance

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,670
into their workflows and by
doing so detect risk earlier,

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,760
we call this approach DataGovOps.

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,630
At the core of DataGovOps' context,

35
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,500
you need to be able to have

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,530
a complete picture of your infrastructure

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,430
and understand every moving aspect

38
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,240
around your data life cycle continuously.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,850
Once you have that context,

40
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,199
you need to be able to
detect risk or operations

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,130
to improve data hygiene at
the earliest stage possible

42
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,310
with minimal human intervention.

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,750
Then it's critical to
deliver that feedback

44
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,620
to the appropriate stakeholders

45
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,220
through their preferred mechanisms

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,053
so that way you can unify
teams and ensure adoption.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The way our system works
getting to the meat of it

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,980
is connecting to the cloud infrastructure

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,870
so we can keep a real time inventory

50
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,870
of every databases get spun
up anywhere in the world

51
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,430
across any of your cloud providers.

52
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,760
Then we connect to the
data stores themselves

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,100
so we can understand the
contents, the schemas,

54
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,940
the privileges, the usage of
the data, and the sensitivity.

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,890
We connect to the identity services

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,470
so we can understand who
your users of data are,

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,030
where do they sit geographically?

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,860
What's their job function?

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,910
And we connected data infrastructure,

60
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,570
things like data catalogs

61
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,753
so we can understand who
owns these data assets.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,340
All of this is streamed
into Dasera's core platform

63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,400
where it's correlated,
enriched, classified and tagged.

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,050
What that allows us to do,

65
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,840
is deliver real time
views across data maps

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,560
or answer questions like,

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,653
who has access to my sensitive data?

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,550
In addition, and more importantly,

69
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,710
aside from more screens to go to,

70
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,750
what we can do is we can

71
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,320
automate and orchestrate
response and alerts

72
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,750
to get the feedback to
the right stakeholders

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,300
through their preferred mechanisms.

74
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,940
So if there's a security risk,

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
we can get it to your soft or your sim.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,130
If there's an action that
the data team needs to take

77
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,760
we can get them a Jira ticket.

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,370
And if it's an automated
update that we need to push

79
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,883
to your data catalog,
we'll push the update.

80
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,190
Ultimately we're gonna help
you detect risk earlier

81
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,320
improve collaboration amongst the teams

82
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,370
move from inspection to prevention

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,850
and help the business
consume data more freely.

84
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,280
Our team is 30 folks with multiple exits

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,190
and our customers are
across every major vertical.

86
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,359
Thank you, come visit us.

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,193
- Nice,

88
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,410
perfect use of time.

89
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,243
And yeah.

90
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:41,420
And, and I've gotta give
a mention to Dasera,

91
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,420
you were in 2020 a part
of our early stage expo.

92
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,843
- That's right.

93
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:50,589
It's so awesome to see you
here now in innovation sandbox.

94
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,423
This is great.
