>> SPEAKER: Please welcome
Senior Vice President/General

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,533
Manager, Networking and
Advanced Security Business

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,065
Group, VMware, Tom Gillis.

00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:26,533
[Applause]

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,433
>> TOM GILLIS: Hey,
I'm Tom Gillis.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm the General Manager for
Networking and Advanced

7
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,000
Security of VMware.

8
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:34,199
And I've got to say, this is
a first for me in my career.

9
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,565
Usually, I'm the opening
act for a rap band, not

10
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,700
the other way around.

11
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:43,600
But I want to talk about what I
think is a pretty significant

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,366
shift in how we think about
and deploy security systems.

13
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,633
So, I have been doing
this for a while.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,799
And as long as I have been
around, and I think many folks

15
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:54,833
in the audience, we all tend to
think about security systems,

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,033
particularly our scanning
security enforcement devices, as

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,200
living in two places, at the
perimeter and at the endpoint.

18
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,966
So, in really simple terms, you
might think I have got a next

19
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,366
generation EDR solution
on my endpoints.

20
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,233
I've got a next generation
firewall at my perimeter.

21
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,266
So, I'm good, right?

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,633
And yet despite the fact that
these are widely deployed

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,166
systems, we see a significant
increase in both the frequency

24
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,366
and the impact of cyberattacks.

25
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,700
And so, I think in really
broad strokes, we have got to

26
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:29,000
think differently about
our security systems.

27
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,099
We need a system that can work
not just at the endpoint, not

28
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,265
just at the perimeter, but
can look across all of that

29
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,266
stuff in the middle. Right?

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,966
We need to look at how a user
interacts with an application

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,666
and understand the
application interacting

32
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,700
with the infrastructure.

33
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:47,966
And the reason why we need this
broad view is because the nature

34
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:51,433
and I think the objective
of the attacks has changed.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,799
Let's just think in
simple terms about Log4j.

36
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:58,433
Whoever discovered that
vulnerability gave themselves a

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,099
skeleton key to virtually
every network on the planet.

38
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,099
I don't know of a single
network that was not impacted

39
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,232
in some way by Log4j.

40
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,099
And so, despite this
unbelievable access to pretty

41
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,266
much everything, what was the
movie script that was stolen,

42
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,366
or the 500,000 credit
cards that were stolen?

43
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,233
There wasn't one, or at least
not one that we know of.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,366
And so, what we can conclude
from this is that the goal of an

45
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:28,500
attacker is not just to get in,
but it is to get in and stay in.

46
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,833
So, think about
this in real terms.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,133
If someone were to break into
your house and let's say steal

48
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,033
your tax return or your
laptop and run, like,

49
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,366
oh, that's a breach.

50
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,465
That's a violation.

51
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,866
Now imagine that someone
were to break into your house

52
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,433
and stay for nine months.

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,333
All right?

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,133
[Laughter]

55
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,366
>> TOM GILLIS:
Moving room to room.

56
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:51,465
It is unthinkable
in the real world.

57
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:55,632
But in cyber, this is the
problem that we're up against.

58
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,333
And it's not just the big folks
that have to worry about this.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,300
Some friends of mine,
their family owns a regional

60
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,400
potato chip company.

61
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,633
They got ransomed twice.

62
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,633
So, that tells you
these attackers, they have

63
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,633
no decency, folks.

64
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:12,233
They're going after our
barbecue potato chips.

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,166
But it's the same tools and
techniques that the attackers

66
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,400
are using to disrupt the potato
chip line could also be used to

67
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,366
say disrupt the power grid.

68
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,533
Or let's imagine that this
attacker said, you know what, if

69
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,166
you're going to remove us from
the global financial system,

70
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,733
what if we decided to
erase every bank account

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,699
in North America?

72
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,266
And so, this is not hyperbole
anymore, unfortunately.

73
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,366
And in a zero-trust model,
we have to assume that the

74
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,965
attackers are in.

75
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:43,465
So, the name of the game is how
do we make it hard for them to

76
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,565
move laterally and stay in?

77
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,800
This is why I
think lateral security

78
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,133
is the new battleground.

79
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,533
So, what do we think about and
define as lateral security?

80
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,132
It really requires an end-to-end
view in how a user interacts

81
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,033
with the application.

82
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,198
So, we have to gather telemetry
from the user themselves, the

83
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,566
device they're on, what's the
posture of that device, the

84
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,599
network that you traverse,
the application - and this is

85
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,533
important - the application
can't be viewed as a monolith.

86
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,766
We've got to look at the little
piece parts, the services that

87
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,332
make up the application and how
it interacts with the data.

88
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,399
And then we will be
prepared to deal with

89
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,500
these sophisticated threats.

90
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,933
So, there are three steps
for how we can do this.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,699
I'll argue that the first and
perhaps most important is we

92
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,966
have to come up with a way
that we can protect the inner

93
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,800
workings of an application.

94
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:37,166
Now when I talk to customers
about this, they will say, oh,

95
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,300
okay, I think about my security
toolchain for apps and how I can

96
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,633
protect my apps in terms of a
set of tools that I use on my

97
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,166
private Cloud, and I've got a
different set of tools that I

98
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,533
think about on my public Cloud.

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,666
And while I understand that
thinking, I'm going to suggest

100
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,199
that we need to turn
it 90 degrees. Right?

101
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:59,233
We need to talk about how do I
protect the inner workings of a

102
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,100
traditional application that
is going to be predominantly

103
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,100
VM-based, and then, separately,
how do I protect the inner

104
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,399
workings of a modern
application, which is going

105
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,566
to be predominantly
Kubernetes-based?

106
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,966
Because the concepts are
the same, but the insertion

107
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,600
mechanisms are different.

108
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,666
So, let's consider
each one separately.

109
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:22,466
When we think about east-west
controls for VM-based

110
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,066
applications, the most, I think
- for many people, the most

111
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,566
obvious control that
you're going to think

112
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,433
of is micro-segmentation.

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,966
And so, to illustrate how micro
segmentation solves this problem

114
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,000
and fits into the overall
picture, I'm going to run

115
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,698
a little experiment. Okay?

116
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,699
I want all of you in the
audience for just a moment to

117
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,066
become SOC analysts.

118
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,765
So, can you analyze this traffic
pattern and see if you can

119
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,633
identify an anomaly?

120
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,199
See anything weird there?

121
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,266
All right.

122
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
Now, I'm from Boston,
so I look at that, I'm like,

123
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,366
nope, that's normal.

124
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,300
That's how we drive.

125
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,399
My dad would be proud of me.

126
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,466
He's like good move, son.

127
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,300
You drove around the tree.

128
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,399
You got two cars ahead.

129
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:08,800
But for most of us, right,
micro-segmentation stops what is

130
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,532
obviously bad traffic.

131
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,699
It's traffic that is trying to
use application pathways that

132
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,566
should never exist
in the first place.

133
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,299
So, let's put guardrails in
place and let's stop that

134
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,133
traffic from flowing.

135
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,600
Now, the good news is
micro-segmentation is - it

136
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,300
probably just had its
7th birthday, so it's been

137
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,366
around for a while.

138
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,433
And I can say with confidence
that the tools for doing

139
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,500
micro-segmentation at
scale are pretty mature.

140
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,765
That's the good news.

141
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,100
Here is the bad news.

142
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,332
The bad news is that the
attackers are assuming you have

143
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,699
micro-segmentation in place.

144
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,566
One of the more interesting and
disturbing trends that we are

145
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:46,265
seeing in the last two years is
the significant increase in what

146
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,566
the security researchers call
living off the land attacks,

147
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,532
which means that attackers are
using a stolen credential or

148
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,933
compromising a protocol to move
through legitimate application

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,600
pathways, and the number one
protocol that we see is RDP,

150
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,300
remote desktop protocol.

151
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,866
You can't just block RDP because
that is what your sys admins are

152
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:08,399
using to update their servers.

153
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:11,733
So, how can we look at each one
o these RDP connections and

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,233
figure out is this the
sys admin updating a server,

155
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,266
or is this ransomware?

156
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:21,433
So, this is not a
radically new concept.

157
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,133
This is what SIM systems
were designed to do more

158
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,899
than 10 years ago.

159
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's look across
everything and try to

160
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,366
figure out friend from foe.

161
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,500
But SIM systems are subject to
an immutable rule of security,

162
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:35,433
all of us are, you can't
stop what you can't see.

163
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,966
And so, for many customers,
I think SIMs suffer from the

164
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:41,866
car alarm problem.

165
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,666
Do you know what the
car alarm problem is?

166
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,100
If you're walking down the
street and you hear a car alarm

167
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,933
going off, what do you do?

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,899
You keep walking, right?

169
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,899
Maybe yell, shut that
thing off. Right?

170
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:55,800
So, car alarms have very,
very high false positive rate,

171
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,199
and so does a SIM.

172
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,300
And it's not that the
analytics in a SIM are bad.

173
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:03,233
The problem is you're
relying on sample data.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,833
And when an attacker is trying
to use legitimate application

175
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,566
pathways, you can't rely on
something like just net flow or

176
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:13,066
sample data to see
these kinds of patterns.

177
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,765
We have to look deeper.

178
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,600
So, again, let's think about how
we can instrument traditional

179
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,500
applications, which are
VM-based, and identify the inner

180
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,599
workings of that application.

181
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,000
Many customers will think about,
all right, I'm going to deploy

182
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,265
a network tap. Okay?

183
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,866
So, the network tap is going to
look at that east-west traffic

184
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,699
and try to find the bad guys.

185
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:35,266
But if an application has let's
say three tiers, a web tier, an

186
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,966
app tier, and a data tier,
and they're all VMs running

187
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:41,100
on the same chassis,
that east-west traffic,

188
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,233
it never leaves the box.

189
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,632
It's not going to hit a network
switch or a network tap, and so

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,533
it creates a blind spot.

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,299
And here is what makes the
problem worse is that the

192
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:54,699
silicon vendors, Intel and AMD,
and hypervisor vendors like

193
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:58,099
VMware, are building
ultra-high-density servers

194
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,966
where, on the latest generation
of hardware, we can run more

195
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:05,833
than a - well over 100 VMs in a
single chassis, more like 150.

196
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,333
So, imagine you have got 100VMs
that are talking to each other,

197
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,399
and that traffic
never sees a switch.

198
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:14,299
When I was an engineer, one of
my teachers used to stand up in

199
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:18,133
the classroom, and he says,
never forget, Tom, GIGO.

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,133
Does anyone know
what GIGO stands for?

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,933
Garbage in, garbage out.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,833
And I know some
people recognize that.

203
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,333
It's an old programming
term, I guess.

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,166
But the idea is that if you're
looking at 1% of the east-west

205
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,665
traffic and you're trying
to figure out, is that RDP

206
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,433
connection good or bad, that's
not enough sample data to make

207
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,933
an intelligent division.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,899
So, we need to look
at all of the traffic.

209
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,600
Here is where the virtualization
layer becomes the security

210
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,700
professional's best friend,
because when you instrument the

211
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,799
virtualization layer,
you see every packet.

212
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,500
In fact, you know what process,
not just what application, which

213
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,266
process initiated that.

214
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,132
Even if it's encrypted, we can -
hypervisor can peek up into the

215
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,966
guest and say, well, it's an
encrypted connection, but I'm

216
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,633
going to look at the
payload in the clear.

217
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,333
So, it is very high-fidelity
data that allows us to

218
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,299
understand every connection,
and, more importantly, to

219
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:09,233
understand the conversation
in context and figure out is

220
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:10,366
this real or not.

221
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:14,433
Now, same exact principle
applies for modern apps, but the

222
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,333
insertion mechanisms are
different, because in a modern

223
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,500
app, you're not dealing with
three tiers, you might be

224
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:23,566
dealing with 300 micro-services,
or maybe even 3,000 micro

225
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,466
services, lots of tiny little
chunks of code, and they're all

226
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,100
talking to each other.

227
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,866
Each one of these micro-services
has its own internal API.

228
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,633
And so, in order to protect that
application from within, we need

229
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,766
to understand those APIs.

230
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,333
We need to see those APIs.

231
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,266
Again, the good news is just
like the virtualization layer is

232
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,665
a friend to VMs, there is a new
technology called a service

233
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:48,799
mesh, which is built on open
standards that allows us to see

234
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,333
those inner workings.

235
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,500
And so, we can observe and
measure the APIs, understand

236
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,899
their schemas, and baseline
them and say this is what

237
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,733
normal looks like.

238
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,600
So, if an attacker is in
doing something that's highly

239
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,866
anomalous, we can pick it up
and detect it and protect those

240
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:07,899
east-west APIs, which allows us
to, again, see every connection

241
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,100
and understand the conversation.

242
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,899
So, when I talk to customers
about this, they will be like,

243
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,233
ooh, beautiful story, Tom.

244
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:14,899
I love it.

245
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,200
I want to do this.

246
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,299
But where do I start?

247
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:20,199
And this is actually the third
and one of the most important

248
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,665
points I wanted to
deliver to this room.

249
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,333
As every enterprise company is
embracing the Cloud operating

250
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,899
model in a significant way,
security has an opportunity to

251
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,533
lead the conversation, not
follow it, to lead the

252
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,366
conversation, and say, you know
what, as we move into a world of

253
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,399
Cloud operating, we are not
going to take the old toolset

254
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,733
and try to graft it on.

255
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,899
We're going to think differently
about how we instrument our VMs

256
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,799
and how we instrument our
containers so that we can

257
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,833
protect those
applications from within.

258
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,500
And yet, when I talk to
customers, many of them are

259
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,733
saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're going to automate our data

260
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,399
center and we're just going to
use the existing toolset, these

261
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,833
firewalls and load
balancers that we have.

262
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,333
I'll say, oh, so you can launch
a workload without having to

263
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,500
update firewall rules.

264
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,233
Oh, no. No.
We open a ticket for that.

265
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,132
Our guys are good, though.

266
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,500
We close those tickets
in like two weeks.

267
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:13,533
I'll say, okay, how about
getting a VIP, a virtual IP,

268
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,399
from a load balancer?

269
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:18,166
No. We open a
ticket for that, too.

270
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,799
And so, I kind of sometimes
let my mind wander, and I

271
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:22,833
think this is like sort of
partial automation.

272
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,466
Is this some kind of
like IT vending machine?

273
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,833
And I go up to that vending
machine and I push a button in

274
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,533
it and request a firewall
update, but behind that vending

275
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,799
machine is a person and they get
that ticket, and they go take -

276
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,533
I've got to take that to Steve.

277
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,833
Oh, is Steve around? No.

278
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,066
Is Steve on vacation?

279
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:39,766
Where's Steve?

280
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,966
Oh, let's go to Brian.

281
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,200
Brian gets it and then takes
that request, and he passes it

282
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,399
to an engineer and
days are going by.

283
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,100
Our engineer gets that request,
scratches his beard, ooh,

284
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,633
firewall update, eh?

285
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,966
Hmm, let me think about that.

286
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,100
Punches some buttons.

287
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,500
Maybe I'm going to have lunch.

288
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,366
I'm kind of hungry, you know.

289
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,133
Is it lunchtime?

290
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,899
Okay. Here's your firewall.

291
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, the vacuum tube.

292
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,100
I wonder if they have
one of those vacuums.

293
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,700
Remember those things
in the mailroom? Whoosh.

294
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:03,000
Finally, your firewall
rules get updated, and now

295
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,133
days have gone by. All right?

296
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,666
So, taking existing toolsets and
trying to graft them onto the

297
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,866
Cloud operating model,
that's not automation.

298
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:15,600
So, if you remember one thing
from this conversation, when you

299
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,866
go into the Cloud operating
model, I want you to think

300
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,633
about nothing. Okay?

301
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,733
And what I mean by nothing is
zero tickets, zero network taps,

302
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,333
zero expensive proprietary
appliance because those things

303
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,500
are a rip-off, and zero trust.

304
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:35,000
All of these
concepts fit together.

305
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:38,366
In the Cloud operating model,
we want the guts of our private

306
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,165
Cloud to look and behave
like the public Cloud.

307
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,233
Do you think the public Cloud
providers are buying expensive

308
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,366
firewalls and proprietary
load balancers? No.

309
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:52,233
It's racks and racks of
X86 systems with scale-out

310
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,399
infrastructure software.

311
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,933
Not a software VM of what is
a hardware firewall, but a

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,833
scale-out architecture with
high-level APIs that understands

313
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:04,166
the topology of an application.

314
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,899
And when this is your
foundation, it allows you

315
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,100
to think about security.

316
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,133
And all of that instrumentation
of the east-west traffic, that

317
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,299
security becomes code.

318
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,266
And so, instead of updating it
with a ticket and waiting for

319
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,199
Steve to get back from vacation
to update this system, the

320
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,966
computers do the work.

321
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:25,266
The Cloud operating model gives
us this magical combination of

322
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,699
operational efficiency and
better security because all

323
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:33,233
of our infrastructure is
implemented as software.

324
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,066
Core switching, routing,
firewall, IPS, load balancer,

325
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,000
advanced threat detection, all
of that stuff is under these

326
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:42,299
high-level APIs, which means
we have freed it from the

327
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:46,033
dependencies of proprietary
hardware, which means we can

328
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,500
pick it up and move it.

329
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,833
And so, real world example, I
had a customer who was running

330
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,666
a production data center in
Ukraine and things got really,

331
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,366
really crazy really, really
fast, and they had to move that

332
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,100
data center from their private
Cloud, they wanted to split it

333
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,166
across two providers.

334
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,032
They did it in a weekend.

335
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,899
Now you don't move a
data center that often.

336
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:10,000
But when you do, it makes
you realize the power of the

337
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,899
operational efficiency that we
get with a Cloud operating model

338
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:16,466
and the ability to instrument
this stuff in a way that we can

339
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,733
detect these advanced threats.

340
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,799
So, to talk a little bit more
about the impact that these

341
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,433
threats are having on our
security teams, I've got a

342
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,799
special guest that
is going to join us.

343
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,133
She's going to join us remotely.

344
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,866
It's Dr. Amelia Estwick.

345
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:33,665
Amelia is the head of
threat research at VMware.

346
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,599
She's no stranger to the
threat operations community.

347
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,700
She's worked for more than 17
years in the NSA in various

348
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,866
threat operations roles.

349
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,333
She's a veteran of the
Gulf War, U.S. Army INFOSEC.

350
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,533
She's very active in the
academic community on

351
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,399
cybersecurity issues.

352
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,000
Amelia, thank you for
joining us remotely.

353
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,733
You spent more time in the
SOC than anyone I know.

354
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,566
What do you think are the
greatest challenges impacting

355
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,633
SOC leadership today?

356
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,500
>> AMELIA ESTWICK: Well, Tom,
that's quite interesting.

357
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,266
I actually see two challenges.

358
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,632
One is - we talked
about earlier - is data.

359
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,399
Our SOC analysts are
inundated with data.

360
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:14,833
When I worked at NSA, I worked
in a network threat operations

361
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,366
center for ten years, and our
analysts were inundated with

362
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,200
data back then, and
that is, unfortunately,

363
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,733
still the case today.

364
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,799
So, our adversaries know this,
and they remain stealthy.

365
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,566
They know that having that
signal to noise ratio is so

366
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:37,066
difficult to determine
for our SOC analysts.

367
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,866
So, our SOC analysts also need
the right tooling, integrated

368
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:46,066
tooling so they can then look at
those alerts with high fidelity

369
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:50,200
and able to not only correlate
those results, but also with

370
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,699
machine learning and analytics.

371
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:57,433
This will help increase the
fidelity so we can, again, evict

372
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,966
those attackers out
of our networks.

373
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,633
>> TOM GILLIS: So, Amelia, we
are here at the RSA Conference,

374
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
thousands of security
professionals all gathered

375
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,666
together, and we all
face a common adversary.

376
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,566
These attacks are more
sophisticated and more

377
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,733
disruptive than ever before.

378
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,266
Do you have any thoughts on how
we can do as a community to stop

379
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,933
these kinds of problems?

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,566
>> AMELIA ESTWICK: Well, I've
got a couple of thoughts, but

381
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,165
one that's top of mind,
really, is we all just need

382
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,765
to come together.

383
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:31,900
Not one organization/vendor
has a silver bullet.

384
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:35,399
We're all on one team to fight
against the common adversary.

385
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,666
So, what does that mean?

386
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,633
That means, here at VMware,
we are very fortunate to have

387
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,799
visibility across the
enterprise, that's the user, the

388
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,266
device, all the way through
to the network and the

389
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,833
applications, and we are
really, really excited to

390
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,500
partner with the community and
the ecosystem to build not only

391
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:59,299
the tools and technologies,
but also common frameworks and

392
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:03,733
sharing this telemetry with the
ecosystem so we can not only

393
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,433
protect our customers
in a community, but also

394
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,466
protect our nation.

395
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,099
>> TOM GILLIS: Amelia,
thank you very much.

396
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,466
And as Amelia said, the security
operations center, they don't

397
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,366
need more data. All right?

398
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,033
They don't need more alerts
that they have to respond to.

399
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,500
What they need are high-fidelity
signals that are actionable.

400
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:25,066
And so, as proud as we are of
our ability to correlate what we

401
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:28,233
see on the endpoint and what we
see in the network, we also at

402
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,000
VMware recognize that
it's an ecosystem.

403
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,866
And so, we're announcing at the
show that we're joining the Open

404
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,299
XDR Alliance, working with our
partners and other vendors,

405
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,766
sometimes our competitors, to
create common data models,

406
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,933
common schema, to make these
systems work better together

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,700
because the sophistication
of the attackers just

408
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,599
grows and grows.

409
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,700
The other thing we're announcing
at the show for is that we're

410
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:56,500
taking our discrete security
telemetry sets that we have from

411
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:01,066
the endpoint for our EDR
customer base for the access

412
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,700
point and for nearly every
private Cloud workload

413
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:06,466
imaginable, and we're pulling
this all together into a single

414
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,599
threat telemetry database
that we call Contexa.

415
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,166
Contexa is the brain that gives
us the context to understand is

416
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,399
that a legitimate
RDP connection or does

417
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,866
that look like ransomware.

418
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:21,299
So, for you as security
professionals, now is the

419
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,266
time to drive change.

420
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,566
Now is the time to embrace the
Cloud operating model, and not

421
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,033
just cut and paste our old ways
of working, but let's move

422
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,799
forward with a new way of
instrumenting our workloads,

423
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,766
protect them from within,
and get ready for

424
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,299
this next onslaught.

425
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,533
Thank you all very
much for listening.

426
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,599
Come by and see us
at the show floor.

427
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,299
And, of course,
stay safe, everyone.

428
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:44,500
Thanks.
