1
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,785
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Chief Executive Officer,

2
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:11,468
Forcepoint, Manny Rivelo.

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,662
>> MANNY RIVELO:
Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,055
It is great to see all of you.

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,423
It has been two and a half
years since we have all gotten

6
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:27,374
together and it's been amazing
to kind of walk the floor and

7
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:29,897
have the event
and actually rekindle a lot

8
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,255
of old relationships.

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,729
And the other key finding that I
want to share at this moment is

10
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:39,622
how many people I have seen
with new post-COVID wardrobes.

11
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:41,141
Right?

12
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,058
It's kind of – a lot
of folks were nervous

13
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:44,438
to come into the event.

14
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,562
Getting around a new crowd.

15
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,187
And also, I heard a lot of
people saying, I'm not sure what

16
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:50,299
I'm going to wear.

17
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:51,574
So, we are all here.

18
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,357
We are hopefully all
having a good event.

19
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:57,275
And I wanted to talk today about
security's dirty little secret

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,403
and this concept of the
conservation of complexity.

21
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:03,272
And folks ask me, well
what does that mean?

22
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,746
Well, what that means is
the world, as you just heard, is

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,351
progressing very, very quickly.

24
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,009
The hacking community
is not slowing down.

25
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,913
I will show you some
stats here in a second.

26
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:16,957
And yet, with all of this
productivity that we have

27
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,908
created, with all of the – the
way we are changing the way we

28
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:23,630
work, the way we live, the
way we do everything, right, it

29
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,126
isn't getting easier.

30
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,387
The problem is still there
and we have to simplify that

31
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:30,108
problem, which means
we need to change.

32
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,825
And when I say we, that is our
customers need to move quicker,

33
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:37,560
our partners need to move
quicker, and us as vendors need

34
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,183
to move much quicker.

35
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,527
So, I thought I would start
by talking a little bit about

36
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,067
what's my day look like.

37
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:48,058
And I'm an early riser, if you
know me, so I usually get up and

38
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:51,026
I get up about 5:00 in the
morning, and I usually have an

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,818
iPad next to me and I usually
pick it up and go through my

40
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:57,199
corporate email on my iPad.

41
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:01,356
And as I walk around the house
and get ready for the morning, I

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,744
usually head out early in the
morning and go to the gym and

43
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:07,332
try to get a couple of
miles on the treadmill.

44
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:11,275
And as I'm stopping at
stoplights on the way there, I

45
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,204
may check, using my personal
device, additional emails and

46
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:17,113
just try to get
my day organized.

47
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,748
Now, I have been on
two unmanaged devices

48
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,022
in my corporation,
finished my workout.

49
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,421
I may order a cup of coffee
from Starbucks, pick it up, get

50
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:31,358
home, get ready, and I'm on my
first video conference session

51
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,903
on my corporate computer.

52
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:37,386
That could be followed very
quickly with a search on the

53
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,012
web, and this could be anything.

54
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,501
I remember last week doing a
quick search just to try to get

55
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:44,663
an address because I was meeting
a customer later that day and I

56
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,669
wanted their corporate address.

57
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:52,197
I may also turn around and check
our Salesforce numbers, what

58
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,544
are we doing.

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,441
Maybe I look at an opportunity
on Salesforce because I want to

60
00:02:56,465 --> 00:03:00,511
understand the situation that
that customer has and what that

61
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,284
deal is all about.

62
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,213
And that could be on a
corporate provided device.

63
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,835
I may turn around
and check the bio.

64
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,502
RSA asked me to confirm my bio,
so I had to do that, and I did

65
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:12,218
that off of my iPad.

66
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:15,588
And I may turn
around and actually go into

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,854
Slack to download
our corporate presentation.

68
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,208
And the reason for doing that
is predominantly because I had a

69
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,228
customer meeting that I had
to present at later in the day.

70
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:32,586
Then I may go a little further
than that and pay a personal

71
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,708
bill using my bank account.

72
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,191
And I may actually even go
a little further than that and

73
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:44,230
approve, on my mobile device,
basically a rec to approve a

74
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:46,131
payment for a vendor.

75
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:50,897
And all of this happens probably
by 8:00 in the morning, and it

76
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,297
repeats itself in different
patterns every single day.

77
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,352
And this week, you know, I
have been on public Wi-Fi.

78
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,793
I have been on Gogo Internet.

79
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,580
I have been a whole
bunch of different places

80
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:02,934
accessing the network.

81
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,659
And this gives me an
incredible amount of

82
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:11,061
productivity that has changed
my workday and my personal life,

83
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:13,614
allowing me to
enjoy it a lot further.

84
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:18,618
And this basically has come
because the innovation that we

85
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,915
have created over the last fifty
years in this industry, right?

86
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,404
In the early 70's, the open
standards – and the keyword here

87
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:28,856
is “open” – standards
for TCP/IP emerged.

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,409
And since that day, we have been
chasing and fighting hackers

89
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:36,536
because they also have access
to all of the openness that's

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,813
created this change
that we have.

91
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:41,369
So, you see early
viruses were introduced.

92
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,914
You see the
formation of the web.

93
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,780
You see the formation of
applications on the web,

94
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:50,162
cloud-based services, continuing
to see additional, additional

95
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,054
attacks inside the environment.

96
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:56,558
And then over the last couple of
years, because of the pandemic,

97
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,428
everything accelerated at
a fast pace.

98
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,366
We all went home
and worked from home.

99
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,107
Our applications went further
to the cloud and our data went

100
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:05,667
further to the cloud.

101
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,935
And I would argue
it's only the beginning.

102
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,156
There is more change.

103
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,949
There is additional change
happening whether it be what

104
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:18,028
happens with post quantum
computing, how is the world

105
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,293
going to look for us?

106
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,169
What happens with
things like the metaverse?

107
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:24,858
I could assume a couple of years
from now, for sure within five

108
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:28,207
years, I will be spending some
time on the metaverse prior to

109
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:31,243
8:00 in the morning because
we may be doing business on the

110
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:34,674
metaverse, and/or there might
be something in my personal life

111
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:36,293
that I want to
take advantage of.

112
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:40,196
And all of this gain
which is unstoppable comes

113
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,656
with a great cost.

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,889
And this is the cost.

115
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:45,487
I will share only – I will
talk about two metrics here.

116
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:52,011
The first is $10.5 trillion is
the cost of cybercrime, and

117
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:55,827
that's what's
projected by the year 2025.

118
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,825
That is the third – if you
compare this through a GDP, it

119
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,476
would be the third largest
economy in the world behind the

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,502
US and China.

121
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,165
So, it is good business to hack.

122
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,243
It is not going away.

123
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,226
The second is we live as
security professionals in an

124
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,874
industry that has
negative unemployment.

125
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:21,406
There are 3.5 million jobs
and growing requesting security

126
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,802
professionals every single day.

127
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,748
And as a community,
what have we done?

128
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:31,255
We have given you an alphabet
soup of three, four-letter

129
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:37,443
acronyms that most individuals
can't conceive, with management

130
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,846
consoles with different ways of
managing that, and the world has

131
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,772
become just way,
way too complex.

132
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,870
So, we need to fix this.

133
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,385
And if you think about the
architectures of the past, these

134
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:55,817
perimeter-based, rigid
architectures which used to

135
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,529
work, no longer work.

136
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:01,130
The users aren't in the office
as often as they used to be and

137
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,917
the applications are not there.

138
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:08,510
So, yet we hairpin the traffic
back and we do all of this with

139
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:12,976
implicit security, creating
a poor user experience.

140
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,199
It just has to change.

141
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:17,796
And it has to
change at a fast pace.

142
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:21,521
And this is the time to
begin to think differently.

143
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:26,660
Because it is rare, really
rare, where you see the analyst

144
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:31,879
community and everybody come
around and begin to gel around a

145
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:36,009
new architecture, a new
way of driving your business.

146
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,885
And if we want to get in front
of these hacks, we have to adapt

147
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,348
that and change at
an incredible pace.

148
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:46,366
So, this new architecture starts
out, as you heard just from the

149
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,717
previous presentation,
with zero trust.

150
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:52,514
Now, what is zero trust?

151
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:56,248
Zero trust has been
around for over twenty years.

152
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:58,106
There was a research
document that was written

153
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,528
in the early 70's.

154
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:04,537
Google implemented it in
about 2009 in the BeyondCorp.

155
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:09,359
And then it was written by, by
Forester, and named by Forester.

156
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:13,820
And about 2018, NIST and other
government organizations came

157
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:17,567
out with a security – a
zero trust architecture.

158
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:20,626
So, it's taken twenty years
to get here and yet we haven't

159
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,450
adopted it and yet it is
a great solution for some

160
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,951
of the attacks that
are happening today.

161
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:31,467
Because on one side, it
separates a user, the location,

162
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:35,283
the device from the
applications and the data,

163
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,914
and it creates this zone.

164
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,661
It only allows that
connection to happen

165
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:41,836
through explicit trust.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,142
And it has
a fundamental principle;

167
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,636
never trust, always verify.

168
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:53,065
So, it creates this
perimeter-less environment, and

169
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,499
it's a very, very different way.

170
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:58,193
So, your architecture needs
to take this into consideration.

171
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:03,746
The second major change is this
concept of moving the stack of

172
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,348
equipment that you have and
services at the edge of your

173
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,110
network and shifting
them to the cloud.

174
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:13,583
Through these frameworks, these
secure access services edge

175
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,129
frameworks like SASE, which
are usually comprised of a

176
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:21,517
foundational element that is
zero trust, but it's also got to

177
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,170
be risk adaptive because
zero trust is always verify.

178
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,473
So, after the connection has
been established, I have to

179
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:30,131
understand what the behavior is
of that connection and be able

180
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:33,442
to change or terminate
that connection if required

181
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,226
with a single console.

182
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,582
Sitting on top of it is the
capability to prevent threats,

183
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:45,886
and that is technology such as
AV, sandboxing, CDR, content

184
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,701
disarmament and reconstruction,
remote browser isolation, data

185
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,796
discovery, data protection,
data monitoring, et cetera.

186
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:57,193
And then sitting on top of that
is a series of gateways so that

187
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,900
as you are communicating through
an email channel or through a

188
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,983
web channel or through a private
application channel, that I can

189
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:07,757
intercept that data
and inspect that data.

190
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:11,707
And if you place this in
the cloud and it is available

191
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:17,544
everywhere in the world with
high availability, now you can

192
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:20,245
connect from anywhere in
the world to any application.

193
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,678
You could liberate your
organization, you could liberate

194
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,245
your employees to work from
anywhere, and provide these

195
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,989
security services
instantaneously.

196
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,902
The third major
component is what I

197
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:33,739
referred to as smart edge.

198
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:37,767
There is a need at times
to push those security services

199
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,967
to the edge.

200
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:42,299
Now, you may push those
services to an office through

201
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:47,323
something like SD-WAN and secure
SD-WAN which would allow you to

202
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,448
get away from your traditional
NPLS circuits and create better

203
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:54,436
connectivity by application or
by user through those security

204
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,140
services, or you may have an
agent on an endpoint, that agent

205
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:01,131
giving you that flexibility, or
you are actually – actually be

206
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,703
implementing smart
browser-like technology

207
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,985
inside that environment also.

208
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:13,558
What's amazing is from
the endpoint, there are three

209
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:15,625
actions you can have
with this architecture.

210
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,075
The first is if you want to
inspect the traffic, you can

211
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,161
send it through the proxies
by application and inspect that

212
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,790
traffic using any one of
those data plane services

213
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,519
and the right security
services behind that.

214
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,977
However, you also have the
capability at the endpoint to

215
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,573
make two other decisions.

216
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,233
One it would be, I
want to block the traffic,

217
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:38,397
so you just drop it.

218
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:41,273
Or the other is, this
is traffic that doesn't

219
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,587
need to be inspected.

220
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:44,276
It is a simple Google search.

221
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,668
Maybe I don't
want to inspect that.

222
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:48,171
Maybe it's a web conference
that I don't want to inspect.

223
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,607
Maybe it's an audio conference
that I don’t need to inspect and

224
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,550
I just want to
listen to it, or music.

225
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,933
As a result of that, you
could bypass those security

226
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:59,434
services, creating a
better user experience.

227
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,208
So, those are
three basic principles.

228
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:06,294
Now, what's interesting
is it opens up a whole

229
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,895
bunch of solutions.

230
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,911
One I will talk to here
is zero trust, as I refer

231
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,276
to it, as zero trust web access.

232
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,487
What does that mean?

233
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,236
From any place in the world, any
device in the office, outside

234
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,949
the office, managed, unmanaged,
I want to access the web and I

235
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,847
want to access it
and be confident.

236
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,937
So, obviously, you do have the
traditional secure web gateways

237
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,000
where you could categorize
websites as good, as bad.

238
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,240
But if I'm going to a suspicious
website that I don't know, I

239
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:35,085
could insert a remote browser
in front of it, which means I

240
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:39,222
could go in the website knowing
very well that I have a machine

241
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:44,675
on the web that's executing my
commands, and all I'm seeing is

242
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,279
a pixel – smart pixel
rendering of what is on

243
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:50,041
the machine, giving
me a lot of capabilities.

244
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:53,493
So, if the machine was to
get contaminated, it's okay.

245
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,044
When the session is
over, we gold image that

246
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,660
machine and we move on.

247
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,626
But I also have the capability
to upload and download

248
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,168
file using sandboxing
technology for executables

249
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,784
or content disarmament
and reconstruction technology.

250
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:12,721
And the way to think about that
technology, which is basically

251
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,728
government grade
technology, is you actually

252
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:19,666
open up office documents
like Word, Excel, PDFs.

253
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,436
You look at the object model
inside the document which tells

254
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,099
you what should be in the
document, and you remove

255
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,708
everything else that should
not be in that document.

256
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,002
So, if there is a virus in there
or something that shouldn't be

257
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,325
in there, it gets taken out.

258
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,995
It is simply putting bleach on
every single document that you

259
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,398
upload or download.

260
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,522
No different than we sanitize
our hands as often as possible

261
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:45,787
through this pandemic,
that technology is there.

262
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:49,794
So, in this situation, now I
can go to the web, go anywhere,

263
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:53,082
block what I need to block,
allow what I need to allow, and

264
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,500
all of the other traffic,
whether it's traffic that I'm

265
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:59,091
uploading or downloading,
feels safe that it has been

266
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,654
disinfected in the environment.

267
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,574
Very simple to accomplish
leveraging this architecture.

268
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,342
Or I talked about
using Slack to download

269
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:09,973
our corporate presentation.

270
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,567
What if I was right in
front of the customer's

271
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:15,270
location and all I
had was my iPad?

272
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,634
That's an unmanaged device.

273
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:18,861
I could lose that.

274
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,554
I may lose it on a plane ride.

275
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:24,806
Well, it's interesting that you
can actually apply the same

276
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,721
principles here because inside
the browser of that laptop, if

277
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:33,136
you only enable your employees
to use their personal devices

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,774
through the browser, we can
inject in that browser, an AJAX

279
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:42,066
virtual machine inside that,
and now we can apply a CASB

280
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,660
connection with data protection
on top of that to make sure

281
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,738
that, yes, I downloaded the
presentation, I can present the

282
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:53,236
presentation, but I can't
AirDrop it somewhere else.

283
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,812
I can't print it somewhere else.

284
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:57,382
I can't do something.

285
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,906
So, the technology is there to
empower your employees and allow

286
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,978
them to use unmanaged devices.

287
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:09,749
Or a very simple use case,
which is I'm not sure why we are

288
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:13,028
VPNing, I'm not sure why we
are VPNing back to corporate.

289
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:16,193
We are hair pinning the traffic
back to the corporation, yet we

290
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,586
don't need to go there.

291
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:19,166
Can I shift that?

292
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:22,380
If not for all employees,
can I start with contractors?

293
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,753
And can I check those
contractors and give them

294
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:30,398
explicit trust just to the
applications that I approve for

295
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,646
them to have?

296
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:37,040
And do that so when I log
in, all I see is my – maybe Okta

297
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,145
screen that has two
or three applications.

298
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,627
I can log into all of those.

299
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:42,514
I can check the
users’ credentials.

300
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:44,670
I can assess that
the devices are good.

301
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,019
And I could connect them
just to that application.

302
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,992
And then I can inspect the
traffic that’s flowing from that

303
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,807
application down to those
devices through data protection.

304
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,177
Simple to accomplish.

305
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,076
There is a lot of use cases that
we could take advantage with

306
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,937
this modern architecture.

307
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:05,600
So, the modern architecture
gives you a couple of

308
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,906
basic business benefits.

309
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,479
Number one,
implementation of zero trust,

310
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:16,119
moving from implicit security,
which is access to all network

311
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,782
resources through applications
and data on a user device,

312
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,959
geolocation, permission level.

313
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:26,614
The second thing is it increases
your productivity because you

314
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:29,594
don't have to send everything
through to get inspected.

315
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,711
You send what's
appropriate to get inspected.

316
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:35,153
The rest of the traffic goes
directly to the endpoint and you

317
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,847
create a better QOE, quality
of experience, for those users.

318
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,781
The third is you
reduce the complexity.

319
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,282
You don't have
technology to maintain on

320
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:47,151
your websites anymore
and your corporate locations.

321
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:49,077
That conga line
of gear goes away.

322
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:50,580
No more software upgrades.

323
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,774
No more patches.

324
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,963
No more replacing the
hardware when it gets slow.

325
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:59,406
All of that is provided for you
in the web, in infrastructures

326
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:02,759
that are infinite scale,
such as the hyperscalers

327
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:03,991
that are out there.

328
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,034
So, lots of benefits
associated with this.

329
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:11,156
So, the path forward
is fairly straightforward.

330
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:16,850
You will hear it as SASE, you
will hear it as SSE and SD-WAN

331
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:21,771
which are components of SASE,
and it solves an incredible

332
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:24,197
amount of challenges for you.

333
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:28,290
These are some of the ones that
I hear as I talk to customers

334
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:32,342
and they are asking me, Manny,
can you – can you simplify my

335
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,601
environment, the way I
operate my environment,

336
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,283
while reducing the cost?

337
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,504
The answer is,
yes, we can do that.

338
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:42,521
Can you give me basically
for zero trust, something like

339
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:47,036
network – zero trust network
access so only – I don't get

340
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,442
access to the network, I only
get access to the applications

341
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,859
that I should be
getting access to?

342
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,730
Or can you discover
all of my data?

343
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,094
I don't even know
what's out there.

344
00:17:56,294 --> 00:18:01,427
Can you do that, categorize it,
use machine learning and AI to

345
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:06,073
get it correct, then implement
tags on that data and then

346
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,314
protect that data?

347
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:10,180
Because I have data that I
have not only in my corporate

348
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,463
environment, but now
I have out in the Cloud.

349
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:16,606
So, we can get this done
with these architectures.

350
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:22,162
And I will close by saying, and
this is – Benjamin Franklin is

351
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,242
one of my heroes.

352
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:25,209
I think we all have
our own heroes.

353
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:28,881
And he said this
quote a long time ago.

354
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:33,505
“When you are finished
changing, you're finished.”

355
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:38,626
And there couldn't be anything
more true today in our industry.

356
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,932
We have to move quicker.

357
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:42,934
The hackers are moving quicker.

358
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,517
We have to move quicker.

359
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:47,801
And we have to be able
to take the technology and

360
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,926
change at an incredible pace.

361
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,076
We have to adopt it or we
will be left behind because the

362
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,665
innovation that is driving the
digital economy and what our

363
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:02,002
organizations are doing and
what we are doing personally

364
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:03,685
require this change.

365
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,587
So, I want to thank you.

366
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,804
If you have some
time, stop by our booth.

367
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:10,142
And have a great, great event.

368
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,658
Thank you very much.
