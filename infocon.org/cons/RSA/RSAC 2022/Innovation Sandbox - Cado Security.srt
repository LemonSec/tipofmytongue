00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:02,800
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,380
- Our next contestant,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,280
bringing incident response
into the cloud era.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Please welcome CEO and
Co-Founder of Cado Security,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,883
James Campbell.

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,666
(audience claps and cheers)

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,049
- Wow.

8
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:26,881
Man, this is-

9
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:27,998
- How you going?
- This is serious, man-

10
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:28,835
- I know.

11
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:29,835
- You're welcome.

12
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:30,718
- Thank you very much.

13
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:31,551
- All right.

14
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,051
- [Host] Your time begins now.

15
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:36,660
- Remember the eighties?

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,470
The Apple IIe, the DeLorean, the Atari,

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,010
oh, and mix tapes.

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,070
I used to spend hours
making the perfect mix tape.

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,120
I'd wait for my favorite
song to come the radio,

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,620
press a record with those two
really hard to press buttons,

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,120
and wait for the whole song to finish,

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,820
and then I'd repeat the same
tedious process 20 times.

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,450
So what has this got to
do with cybersecurity?

24
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,050
Well, when I think about
how we do incident response

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,550
in the cloud today,

26
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,070
it kind of reminds me
of making a mix tape.

27
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,500
We collect each system, one by one.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,040
We process the data for
each system, one by one,

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,070
just like a mix tape, one song at a time.

30
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,100
Sometimes it takes weeks
and sometimes in the cloud,

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,630
you can't even get access to the data

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,339
you need for an investigation,

33
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,580
and today, that's just not good enough.

34
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,620
There has been significant investment

35
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,870
in cloud prevention and detection,

36
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,300
but when it comes to
investigation and response,

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,800
we're stuck in a mix tape era.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,360
With incident response,
every second matters.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,950
Why wouldn't you use the cloud

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,393
to accelerate investigation and response?

41
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,580
For decades, I've been on the front lines

42
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,350
investigating sophisticated
cyber breaches,

43
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,850
working with every
agency you can think of,

44
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,030
and from NotPetya to Cloud Hopper

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,960
to breaches I definitely can't
disclose publicly here today,

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,940
we've funneled this
experience into Cado Response,

47
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,960
the cloud investigation platform,

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,853
to bring into incident
response into the cloud era.

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,080
Cado has helped some of
the largest organizations

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,030
reduce investigation time by over 80%.

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,830
Instead of manual data collection,

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,539
Cado automates data capture

53
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,500
across cloud container and
serverless environments.

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,060
Instead of relying on
processing systems one by one,

55
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,540
Cado delivers parallel processing.

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,260
Instead of relying on
a hodgepodge of tools,

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,980
Cado unifies data sources

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,673
across cloud provider logs,
disc memory, and more.

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,070
With Cado, what used to take days

60
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,313
now literally just takes minutes.

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Cado automates seamlessly with
existing security products.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
As soon as suspicious
activity is detected,

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,823
Cado captures critical evidence.

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,180
This automation is essential,

65
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,270
especially with all the
serverless environments today

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,293
where data can disappear
in a blink of an eye.

67
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,769
We have such an amazing team.

68
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,410
Collectively, we have founded companies,

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,700
we've driven acquisitions and IPOs,

70
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,269
and we have decades of
experience in cybersecurity.

71
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,490
Now, we've united to change
the shape of cloud security.

72
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,640
Cado is bringing into incident
response into the cloud era.

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,519
Thank you so much for having me today.

74
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,353
Thank you.

75
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:16,186
(audience clapping)

76
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,239
- [Host] Wow.

77
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,350
19 seconds on the clock.

78
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,960
Man, I love the mix tape analogy-

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,793
- Yeah-
- I think.

80
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,350
- I was thinking of wearing a
mix tape but it was too big-

81
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,451
- Yeah, you should.

82
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,284
(James laughs)

83
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:30,117
That's allowable.

84
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:30,950
That's allowable.

85
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,533
