00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> NIR ZUK: Wow! Hi.

2
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,566
So good to see
you all in person.

3
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,566
It's been a while.

4
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:31,366
Anyone here working in a
SOC, security operations

5
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:34,266
center, you know, the
hardest job in IT?

6
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,632
Yes. Okay.

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
I'm here to help.

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,266
You know, here is an
interesting observation.

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,366
Every time or almost every
time there is an incident,

10
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:48,466
God forbid a data breach,
eventually after a few

11
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:52,366
hours, a few days,
sometimes longer than that,

12
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,966
information security or
specifically the SOC comes

13
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,766
back and says we
know what happened.

14
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,132
They went in
through here and

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,266
they exploited something.

16
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,500
Or they phished and they got
ahold of these end points,

17
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,566
and they jumped here and
there, and they got to the

18
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,500
data, and they used
this to xfill it.

19
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:13,066
And somehow you get this
puzzle figured out and you

20
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,265
know exactly what happened.

21
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:20,033
And my question is if you
have all of the information

22
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,099
to figure out what happened
almost every time there is

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,700
an issue, why didn't you
figure out in real time?

24
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:30,266
Why did you wait so long,
only after the data breach,

25
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,000
to tell us what happened?

26
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,333
And, of course, the
answer is there is just

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
too much information.

28
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,700
It's very hard to
do that, right.

29
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,000
When it happens, you need
to go through all of those

30
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,000
different systems that
have different data

31
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,500
from different sources.

32
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:46,700
Your SIEM is probably the
first one you would go to,

33
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:50,333
and then if you have EDR you
go to your EDR database, and

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,233
Cloud logs, and server logs,
and application logs, and

35
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,766
all of these
different places.

36
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,400
And you will get this
picture figured out and,

37
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,899
again, exactly
what happened.

38
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,098
And if you wanted to do it
constantly for each and

39
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,166
every event that's coming
in, you would have to do

40
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,233
the same thing, right.

41
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,766
You would have to take every
event that comes in, and put

42
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,066
it into a timeline, so this
happened, and this happened,

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,800
and this happened, and then
investigate and figure out

44
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,733
whether that's
an attack or not.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,066
And that, of course,
is something that

46
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,199
humans cannot do.

47
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,933
There is just too
much information.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,166
If you wanted to do that,
you can train all of the

49
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,000
people in the world to be
cybersecurity experts, you

50
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,933
just won't be able to do it.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,766
We need machines for that.

52
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,733
And then the next question
is, so, we have been building

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,633
as an industry, and
you have been buying as

54
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,766
our customers,
automation tools

55
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,333
for cybersecurity
operations.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,666
And more and more
of these tools.

57
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:52,333
There is the SOAR, security
orchestration automation and

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,266
response tool, which is
a pretty name that all

59
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,699
cybersecurity people like
me like to give to RPA,

60
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,933
Robotic Process Automation.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,099
And then there is XDR and
other technologies which

62
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,433
automate some of the hunting
that we do, but more the

63
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,433
investigation and
things like that.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,300
There is attack service
management and I'm sure that

65
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,366
many of you are writing
scripts, dozens, hundreds of

66
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:22,266
scripts in order to automate
different things in the SOC,

67
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,599
but it's not there yet.

68
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,400
If you think about it, most
of the automation that the

69
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:29,400
industry is providing and
that individual security

70
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,066
operations centers are
building is really geared

71
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:36,066
towards one thing, which is
to be able to handle all of

72
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,666
the alerts that
are coming in.

73
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,699
We have the infrastructure
that's generating alerts

74
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,833
from the network, from end
points, from applications,

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,833
from servers and so on.

76
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,733
When all these alerts come
in, the traditional approach

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,733
has always been we will use
correlation rules to reduce

78
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,166
the number of alerts that we
need to handle to the exact

79
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,866
number that we can handle.

80
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:00,299
And the goal of these
automation tools is to

81
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,500
change that and to
say, no we are going to

82
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,866
handle all alerts.

83
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,533
Every alert that comes in, a
single alert or a group of

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,899
alerts, an incident is going
to be investigated and dealt

85
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,566
with and whatever the
machines can do, they can

86
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:16,399
do, and then whatever people
have to do, they will do.

87
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:19,899
And it works, but still
it automates handling the

88
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:24,433
alerts, it doesn't really do
what I said before, which is

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,533
we have the data to figure
out that we are under attack.

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,433
We are just not
using the data.

91
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,733
We use it after the fact,
after we know that

92
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,866
we have been attacked.

93
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:38,199
And we need a
different approach.

94
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,199
So the current approach is a
little bit like what the car

95
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:45,800
industry has been doing in
order to automate cars.

96
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,265
Every few years car
manufacturers are coming out

97
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,733
with new
automation technology.

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,566
It started with cruise
control many years ago, and

99
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:56,099
then adaptive cruise role,
and lane keep assist, automatic

100
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,800
braking, backwards
and forward and from the

101
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,032
side and all
different technologies.

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,866
But, still, it's the
human in the center.

103
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,766
The human is still driving.

104
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:12,433
And we can't do that in
the SOC if we want to

105
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,033
investigate each and every
data point that's coming in

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,399
to figure out whether we
are under attack or not.

107
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,066
We need to bring
in the robots.

108
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,832
We need to bring in
automation to make the SOC

109
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,133
automatic, autonomous,
make it run by itself.

110
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,366
We will bring the
people in later.

111
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,199
We can't really do that
without people, of course.

112
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,866
We need the people.

113
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,266
So maybe to explain how this
can be done, let's start

114
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,366
with the basic.

115
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,332
The basic is why is the
security operations center,

116
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,066
the SOC, even in a
position to do that?

117
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,099
Versus whatever
we have deployed

118
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,666
in the infrastructure?

119
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,300
So in the infrastructure
we have tools like network

120
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,399
security and end point
security, identity and

121
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:58,266
access management,
different Cloud security tools,

122
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,433
application security, server
security, workload security

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,666
and so on.

124
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:07,866
And one of the challenges
that all of these tools have

125
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,433
is that -- it's really two
challenges that are related

126
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,466
to each other.

127
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,833
They only look at local
data, right, if you are the

128
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,933
network security tool or you
are the end point security

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,433
tool, and so on, you see
what you see where you see it.

130
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,833
You don't even see, you
know, if you are network

131
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,899
security tool, you don't see
what other network security

132
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,000
tools deployed in
different locations see.

133
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,133
You just have whatever
you have there to

134
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,366
make your decision.

135
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,733
And the same is
true for end point.

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,899
The same is you true for
access control, identity,

137
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,966
and access
management, and so on.

138
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,266
So, very localized decision.

139
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,899
Whereas the security
operations center, we have

140
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:46,066
data coming from all over
the infrastructure, and we

141
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:49,133
can make global decisions,
not just local decisions,

142
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,233
which means that we
can find more issues.

143
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,866
And the second issue, which
is somewhat related, is in

144
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:59,199
the infrastructure in most
cases, we don't have a lot

145
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,966
of time to make a decision.

146
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,166
In the network, in many
cases we need to make a

147
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,466
decision in less
than a millisecond.

148
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,433
Sometimes we can afford 10
or 20 milliseconds if it's a

149
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,100
DNS query or
something like that.

150
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,899
The same is true
for the end point.

151
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,466
Identity and
access management.

152
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,933
When I identify myself, when
I go through the single factor

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,166
or two-factor
authentication, I don't want

154
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,000
to wait five minutes for
machine learning to do its

155
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,666
magic to decide whether
I am whoever I say I am,

156
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,000
it has to be quick.

157
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,732
So we don't have a lot of
time to make a decision in

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,500
the infrastructure, which
means that we are limited as

159
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,732
to what we can do.

160
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,833
Yes, it's getting better,
we use the Cloud, we send

161
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,300
information to the Cloud,
receive an answer within

162
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,599
ten milliseconds, but
it's still limited.

163
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,066
In the SOC, we
have more time.

164
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,599
How much time do we have?

165
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,600
The least possible, of
course, because by the time

166
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,000
we figure out in the SOC
that something happened,

167
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:51,899
it's already too late.

168
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,800
The attack is already
going on, we have to go back

169
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,099
and undo it.

170
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,566
Better if you do it
within a few minutes,

171
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,466
but sometimes
it takes longer.

172
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,166
Sometimes you collect
information over a week and

173
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,733
just at the end of the week
you get the missing piece

174
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,733
that tells you, oh,
that was an attack.

175
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,699
And then you have to go
and undo a week worth

176
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:11,500
of adversary actions.

177
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:12,299
But that's okay.

178
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,599
That's better than nothing.

179
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:20,899
So the SOC is certainly in a
position to make decisions

180
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,366
that the infrastructure
couldn't have made.

181
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,666
So the infrastructure
decided to trust something,

182
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,533
the SOC will reevaluate it
using more data and more

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,399
time and figure out that
something went wrong.

184
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:36,666
So to do that, a few
things need to happen.

185
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,765
The first thing
is we need data.

186
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:42,732
And, you know, if we want to
bring in the robots, what we

187
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,799
call AI, Artificial
Intelligence or the more

188
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,866
technical term, ML, machine
learning, we will call it

189
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,266
AI/ML so the marketing
and technical people

190
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,699
will be happy.

191
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,899
If you want to use
AI/ML, the first thing

192
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,333
you need is data.

193
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,333
And the way AI/ML works is
you need very diversified

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,966
data, and you need
a lot of data.

195
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,833
When I say diversified, I
mean you need features.

196
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,766
Let me explain what
that means in the

197
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,665
context of AIML.

198
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,733
Let's say that you want to
sell products to people, and

199
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,333
you want to figure out what
are they going to buy.

200
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,100
Who is going to be more
probable to buy your product?

201
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,066
So you can do it based on
just the age of the people

202
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,799
and figure out, you know,
the age and some product

203
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,299
they bought in the past and
yeah you will have some

204
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,533
rough idea who is going
to buy your product.

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
If you can get their age and
the zip code, and maybe a

206
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,299
few products they bought
in the past, you can

207
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,600
make better decisions.

208
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,799
Because you have more
features, that's the

209
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,433
technical term, to
make your decision.

210
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,933
If you can get, I don't
know, their income level and

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,100
many more buying patterns
in the past, and so on, the

212
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,766
more data you have,
the easier it is to

213
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,199
reach a decision.

214
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,632
And the same is true
for machine learning.

215
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,033
Machine learning
needs very wide data.

216
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,533
The more features you
have, the better it is.

217
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,333
So you need data from the
network, very deep data from

218
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,933
the network, all HTTP
headers in both directions,

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,366
all DNS traffic, all DCP
traffic, database access,

220
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,500
and many other things.

221
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,833
You need data from end
points, as much as possible.

222
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,666
We collect about 200
megabytes per day from a

223
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,233
user end point and many
terabytes from server end

224
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,933
points or workloads.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,633
You need data from identity
and access management systems,

226
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,733
from Cloud logs for
PaaS services and VPCs and

227
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,632
flow logs, and
application logs, and SaaS,

228
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
public Cloud, so on.

229
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,100
You need as much
data as possible.

230
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,133
So the data has to be
very, very diverse.

231
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
That's the first
thing you need.

232
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,433
And the data is important.

233
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,833
It is important what data
you collect, it has to match

234
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,266
your AI/ML data models and
algorithms that you use, and

235
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,799
by the way, as much as I
would like to hope that this

236
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,233
will be a multivendor world
and that we can collect data

237
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,165
from everyone, I don't
care what you have in the

238
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,699
network, I don't care what
you have on your end points,

239
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,565
I don't care what you
installed on your Cloud

240
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,100
workloads in the Cloud and I
don't care which CASBY you

241
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,600
use, and so on.

242
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,166
We are trying, we are doing
our best, but it's probably

243
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,132
not going to happen.

244
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,066
There has to be very tight
connection between the two.

245
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:23,966
Again, we will try to do our
best with anything, but it's

246
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:28,433
going to work much better
when the vendor controls

247
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,299
both the data sources as
well as the processing

248
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,766
of the data.

249
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,366
So that's one thing
that's important.

250
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,766
We need very
diversified data.

251
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,233
And we need a lot of data.

252
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,399
And a lot of data is
usually not what you collect

253
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,399
today in the SOC.

254
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:49,733
Today in the SOC, the center
is a SIEM, and there most of

255
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,000
the time you have to
consider the cost of it, and

256
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,899
really figure out what you
are going to collect and

257
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,933
what you are not
going to collect.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,399
You have a budget for, I
don't know, three terabytes

259
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,566
a day and you are going
to figure out which three

260
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,266
terabytes a day you
are going to collect.

261
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,466
AI, machine learning, it
doesn't work like that.

262
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:11,733
You are not going to decide
for the machines which data

263
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,833
the machines are
going to use.

264
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,766
They are going to
decide which data

265
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,766
they are going to use.

266
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,299
Which means you need to
collect much more data.

267
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,699
We have customers collecting
almost 100-terabytes per

268
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:23,500
day, and even
more than that.

269
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,833
That's about a
gigabyte per second.

270
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,700
So you need to collect a lot
of data and a lot of diverse

271
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:33,099
data, and the second thing
is we need to bring it

272
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,766
into one place.

273
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,233
Yes, that's usually a
loaded conversation when I

274
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,733
have it with customers.

275
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,933
When I tell them I need the
data in one place, they are

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
like, no, we are already
paying for storing that data

277
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,066
here and that data there and
we have this data lake and

278
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:50,600
that data lake and this
SIEM, and so on, why don't

279
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,066
you use the data
sources we have today and

280
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,799
connect to them?

281
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:58,966
I could, but it's going to
cost you ten times more in

282
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,933
compute, and in network
bandwidth and it's going to

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
take ten times more because
the data will be in the

284
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,065
wrong format sometimes.

285
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,600
Like what am I going to do
with SQL databases which it

286
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,100
comes to machine learning.

287
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,633
So you will need to bring
the data into one place.

288
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,966
Sorry that might mean
duplicating the data.

289
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,133
Just look at the overall
cost and see if it's worth

290
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,833
it or not, but probably all
of the data will need to

291
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,600
come into one place, and
once you do that, you

292
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,533
unleash the machines.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,233
You take the machine
learning, AI, and just

294
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,466
let it at it.

295
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:31,866
Well, that's not enough.

296
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,200
It's not enough for
several reasons.

297
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:39,033
It's not enough because that
machine learning, that AI,

298
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,366
is going to be programmed
by experts that work

299
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,566
for the vendor.

300
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:47,466
For example, in our case, I
have many dozens of security

301
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:51,200
experts, they are all -- or
most of them are ex-military

302
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:57,132
attackers that decided to
move to the good side and

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,233
translate their knowledge of
how to do the top, you know,

304
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:06,566
attack work in the
world to defend.

305
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:09,100
And they program the AI,
machine learning, to do that

306
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,200
and so on.

307
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,466
But they don't
know your business. Right?

308
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:16,399
They know how to detect
general attacks, but each

309
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,399
specific business has
its own data and its own

310
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,666
specific needs and requires
its own specific algorithms.

311
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,366
So the machines
aren't enough.

312
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,633
We need people.

313
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,233
We need to bring in the
people to do what the

314
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,266
machines cannot do, but we
also need the machines to,

315
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,299
over time, learn
from the people.

316
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,133
And we need the machines,
over time, to learn the

317
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,899
business and become
better and better.

318
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:39,733
And I know it sounds like
science fiction and, you

319
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,566
know, maybe it's going
to happen in 20 years.

320
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,133
It's happening right now.

321
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,666
This technology is
happening right now.

322
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:51,965
And all it requires, like I
said before, is to switch

323
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:56,933
our mind from the human is
at the center of the SOC and

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,299
the human is sitting in
front of a SIEM and then we

325
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,100
are going to add a bunch of
automation tools here and

326
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,600
there like SOAR,
and XDR and others.

327
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:09,933
Which are important tools,
and we need them still, but

328
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,866
it's helping with
dealing with alerts.

329
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,133
It doesn't help, really,
with detecting the attacks

330
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,433
that we need to detect.

331
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,833
And we need to do it like
the self-driving car companies,

332
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,566
the autonomous car
companies, have been doing.

333
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:27,933
They have been designing
cars without a steering wheel.

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,066
Assume there are no
humans in the car.

335
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,166
Yes, there are.

336
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,465
Those cars get stuck every
now and then and they don't

337
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,866
know what to do, and you
have to go and release them,

338
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,665
and the cars learn from
that so that next time

339
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,933
it doesn't happen.

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,866
The same is true for the
SOC, we need to design it

341
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,933
without the humans in mind.

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,366
Assuming there are no
humans, no SOC analysts in

343
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,799
the SOC, design it, make
sure it works, and then

344
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,199
bring in the people
whenever we need them.

345
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:57,966
Is it going to be based on
current SOC technologies?

346
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:01,866
Certainly not on the SIEM,
it will be based on robotic

347
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,933
process automation,
or again SOAR.

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,066
It's going to be based on
data and machine learning,

349
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,133
which is what XDR does, but
it has to be done in a very,

350
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,233
very different way.

351
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:14,733
We have to start with a
clean slate and design it in

352
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,699
such a way that, again, we
assume that the SOC has no

353
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,966
people in it, all security
operations is being run by

354
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:26,966
machines, and then we
bring in the people.

355
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:32,533
Now, as I said, this is
happening right now.

356
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,700
I have seen it, I mean, we
are building it, we are

357
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,799
selling it, I have seen it
running for customers and

358
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:41,133
doing amazingly well
detecting the things that

359
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,833
humans cannot detect and
doing things that humans

360
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,799
just can't do.

361
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,633
It's not a question of
whether they know how to

362
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
do it or not.

363
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,933
You can find people that
know how to do it, you just

364
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,633
never find enough of them.

365
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,866
And it's not about training
them and adding tens of

366
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,665
thousands or hundreds of
thousands of cybersecurity

367
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:01,165
experts to the SOC.

368
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,332
The numbers are so big that
it's just not going to happen.

369
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,966
It has to be
based on machines.

370
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,799
And the last question I
have, which I will answer,

371
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:17,465
is that luxury, I mean,
doing this, is that a

372
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,399
necessity or is it optional?

373
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:21,032
Is it just a luxury, you
know, it will be great if

374
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,200
we can do it?

375
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:26,299
And in my opinion,
we have to do it.

376
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,032
I just don't think
we have a choice.

377
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:31,265
I don't think we can
continue working in a mode

378
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,700
where whenever there is
an issue, an attack,

379
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:38,400
a successful attack, an
incident, a data breach or

380
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,065
whatever, I don't think we
can afford to continue to

381
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:44,566
just come back after a few
days or a few weeks and so

382
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,799
on and say, oh, we
know what happened.

383
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,033
It's just unacceptable.

384
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:54,066
It's a cybersecurity
atrocity to do that.

385
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:57,533
Having all of the data to
be able to figure out what

386
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,733
happened and not using the
data in real time to know

387
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,599
that it is happening and
stopping it is not optional.

388
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,166
And keep running the SOC
with people and with the

389
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,200
SIEM and with some
automation tools, it's just

390
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,633
not going to get us there.

391
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,633
We have to do it in a
completely different way,

392
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,433
and this is where security
operations centers are going

393
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,599
to, and we are going to be
here in a few years, and you

394
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,366
are going to see more than
one vendor on the floor

395
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:26,666
talking about it and showing
it and running with it.

396
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,966
And in five years you are
not going to recognize your

397
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,433
security operations center.

398
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,133
It's going to be
completely different.

399
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,866
It's going to run completely
differently, with a completely

400
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,966
different set of
tools and, you know, for

401
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,565
those of you who don't
believe that, we will see

402
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:43,099
who is right in
five years. Okay? Cool.

403
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,466
Thank you very much!
