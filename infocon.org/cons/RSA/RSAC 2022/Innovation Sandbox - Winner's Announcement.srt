1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,490
(Bubbly, upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,320
- [Announcer] Please welcome back our host

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,450
and RSA conference
program committee chair,

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,500
Dr. Hugh Thompson.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,930
(Bouncing, groovy music)

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,762
- Welcome back.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,870
- Thanks so much for being here.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,220
And this is the moment that
you've all been waiting for.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,150
In a few moments, we will announce

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,150
the winner of RSA innovation
sandbox competition 2022.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,339
Now, before we get there,

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,000
I just have to say

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,570
that the presentations
today were incredible.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,570
Like every year, just the
caliber of entrepreneurs,

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,650
the ability to articulate the solution

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,500
just goes up and up and up.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,300
And to me, all 10 of you are set up

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,260
for great success.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,860
So one more round of applause
for our entire participant set

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,833
in the top 10.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,260
Now I would like to welcome up

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,900
two of our judges to discuss

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,500
what happened in that deliberation room.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,033
So please Dorit Door and Nilu Rossinghow.

25
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:32,262
Dorit.

26
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:33,095
- [Dorit] Hello

27
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,038
- Hello, hello, Nilu.

28
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:35,871
How are you?

29
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:36,750
- [Nilu] Great.

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,160
- All right, so I

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,479
- We're not bloodied or bruised.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,110
- Well, and that's what I was gonna ask

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,500
about because Paul is
wearing a mask as is Chris.

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,730
So I can't tell

35
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,510
- [Nilu] Chris has his arms folded too.

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,640
- Yeah, Exactly. Exactly.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,473
Looks like

38
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:53,398
- We've hidden the process well.

39
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,619
- Was there an altercation of any sort

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,560
- Yeah, there was a big dispute

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,140
- Big dispute, okay.

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,329
All right.

43
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,649
- There are many good
technologies out there

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,019
that are interesting and
it's not an easy selection.

45
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:07,852
- All right.

46
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:12,120
So talk to me, contrast
this to prior years,

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,870
you know there have been some years

48
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,829
where the top one or the top three

49
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,990
have just emerged instantly, right?

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,800
It's like guys, okay, who
are we gonna vote for?

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
And it's boom, it's done.

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,840
And you know, you're done and dusted.

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
Was it like that this year?

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,073
Was it?

55
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,630
- No. There was conversation
about every single company.

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,890
The top 10 are really fantastic,

57
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,230
solving really important problems.

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,000
And there were long conversations

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,207
a little bit of table fist
pounding, but we got through it.

60
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:44,040
- Okay.

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,707
- I think that there are many

62
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,888
also technologies that have a lot

63
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,810
of vendors that represent
similar technologies

64
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,510
in different stages in the industry

65
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,049
more in recent years than
maybe in previous years.

66
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,590
So there is a competition

67
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,330
- Did anybody threaten like
to quit the judging board?

68
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,870
Like if you don't put
this one in, I'm gone.

69
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,700
- No, but the conversation
interesting, right?

70
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,429
Because you're trying
to balance execution,

71
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,530
market size, and innovation,
and those are, you know

72
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,900
it's not the same for every company.

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,530
So how you balance that
is a real conversation.

74
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,560
And that's where we were focused

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
because every company
spiked on one of those

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,150
at least one of those dimensions.

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,150
And so any one of the top
10 could end up on stage.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,149
- And the idea here is to
predict the future a bit.

79
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,130
So what would work in the future?

80
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,510
And it's been said by important physicist

81
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,579
that it's hard to predict
specifically the future.

82
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,800
So

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,210
- Jeez, I like the disclaimer.

84
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,140
This is, yeah, this is a great disclaimer.

85
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,100
- Paul made a few of us cry

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,340
- Paul. Wow.

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,313
Paul man, only the contestants
only the contestants.

88
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,350
So now, without any
further waiting or suspense

89
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,358
can we have a drum roll please?

90
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,275
(Bright drum roll)

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,070
The top two candidates

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,680
in no particular order,

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,940
please do not read anything into the order

94
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,183
in which I will say the
names of these candidates.

95
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,113
Candidate number one,

96
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,628
Talon.

97
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:34,461
(Crowd cheering and clapping)

98
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,989
Congratulations, man.

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,823
The top two.

100
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,573
Second drum roll.

101
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,087
(Bright drum roll)

102
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,233
Canada number two.

103
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,330
Bastion Zero.

104
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,258
(Clapping)

105
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,676
(Bouncing, groovy music)

106
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,783
- Congratulations, congratulations.

107
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,570
- Oh my God.

108
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,440
- Okay. The tension, tension is mounting.

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,430
So first huge congratulations
to both of you

110
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,633
to be in this very elite top tier group.

111
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,770
Dorit, tell me about Talon.

112
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,960
What did you guys like about Talon?

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,010
What, what was, what was
the discussion on Talon?

114
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,060
- So the discussion was about the fact

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,910
that Talon is trying
to solve a wide problem

116
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,610
for security of the connected organization

117
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,500
which is an important problem these days.

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,330
And they're trying to commit it

119
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,190
as a innovative alternative
to existing solution.

120
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,230
Now it's hard to predict the future,

121
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,020
but it's legit alternative
that brings simplicity

122
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,979
and manageability through the replacement

123
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,470
of generic browsers for the end user

124
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,383
to browser specific to the enterprise.

125
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,770
- Excellent. All right, Nilu,
tell us about Bastion Zero.

126
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,839
What was the discussion?

127
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,780
What was the discussion?

128
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,030
- So Bastion Zero is tackling
a really important problem

129
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,339
of management and security

130
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,770
of sessions connecting
into the infrastructure.

131
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,090
And it's really interesting important work

132
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,140
with protocols and how
the connections work.

133
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,669
It's a very, very hard problem

134
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,300
and they're starting out in a great place

135
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,320
and we're really eager
to find out the path

136
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,483
and the evolution of the
company going to the future.

137
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,343
- May I have the award?

138
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,680
Somebody have the award?

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,513
Oh yes.

140
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,346
Okay. There is an award.

141
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay, great.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,325
A little bit concerned.

143
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,707
- We didn't leave it at home.

144
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:53,960
- Okay. Someone will be crowned

145
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,602
Innovation Sandbox Winner 2022.

146
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,879
Can we have a final drum roll?

147
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,796
(bright drum roll)

148
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:11,749
Judges who is the winner
of Innovation Sandbox 2022?

149
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,920
- I'm proud to announce the innovation

150
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,930
the winner of the Innovation Sandbox 2022

151
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,823
is Talon.

152
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,323
- Congratulations, congratulations!

153
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:27,801
Congratulations too, thanks
so much for being up here.

154
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:28,885
That's great!

155
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:34,780
- Everybody thank you
so much for being here.

156
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,501
Really, really appreciate it.

157
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,320
Just such a great vibe and energy.

158
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,980
Judges, thank you so much.
