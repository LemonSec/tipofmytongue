1
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,866
>> SPEAKER: Please welcome
General Manager and Vice

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:13,933
President of IBM Security
Services, IBM, Chris McCurdy.

3
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,532
>> CHRIS McCURDY: Wow!
This is great.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,933
This has been such an energizing
week, and so wonderful that

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,600
we're able to get back
after two years apart.

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,132
Of course, over those two years,
the bad guys kept their profile

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,500
really low as well,
saving us a lot of time.

9
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,500
Obviously, that's just a joke.

10
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:50,399
In reality, some of the most
epic and challenging moments in

11
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,666
our security industry
that we faced have passed --

12
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,433
have happened in just
the past two years.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,200
Data breaches kept happening,
impacting some of the biggest

14
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:02,000
brands in hospitality
and other industries.

15
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:05,933
In fact, we saw the cost of a
data breach increase to $4.2

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,133
million per incident
during the pandemic.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,466
We saw attempted attacks on the
COVID Cold Chain, uncovered by

18
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,400
our very own X
Force team at IBM.

19
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,133
Major software supply
chain attacks like Kaseya.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
And, of course, SolarWinds have
all of us, even the government,

21
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:25,033
rethinking our
software partnerships.

22
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:28,333
But I'd say something even more
significant has happened over

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,500
the past two years in security.

24
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:34,433
Imagine if you got a call on
your phone, your kids couldn't

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,200
go to school because
of a cyberattack.

26
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,500
Imagine if you had to wait
in line for hours for gas

27
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,599
due to a cyberattack.

28
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:46,298
Imagine that meat you grill on
the weekends cost $2 more per

29
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,200
pound because of a cyberattack.

30
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:53,033
Well, we don't even have to
imagine any of those scenarios.

31
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,433
All of them happened
over the last year plus.

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,266
In fact, just a year ago last
month, the Colonial Pipeline was

33
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,000
impacted by ransomware.

34
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,766
Did you know the price of gas
rose 10% following the attack?

35
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,733
So, here's what's changed.

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,866
Cyberattacks are leading to
real-world consequences,

37
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,632
including rising prices,
critical supply shortages,

38
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,699
and even investor angst.

39
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:21,066
We've entered into a new age in
cybersecurity where adversaries

40
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:24,366
have found leverage in these
real-world repercussions.

41
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,900
The fusion of the cyber and
physical world has played out

42
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,699
before our very eyes in
just the past few months.

43
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,433
Global conflicts are now
spilling into digital realm,

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,866
traversing the traditional
borders of war, even putting

45
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:44,698
banks, critical infrastructure,
and manufacturing at risk.

46
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,198
So, let me ask, who here
is familiar with six

47
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,433
degrees of Kevin Bacon?

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,766
All right.
Very good.

49
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,333
A bunch of you.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,266
So, for those who don't, a bunch
of college students in 1994 came

51
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,933
up with a theory and game.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,333
The game showed that anyone in
the film industry can be linked

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,766
through their film roles to
Kevin Bacon with six steps.

54
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,466
So, this is actually based on
the six degrees of separation,

55
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:10,732
which assumes any two people
on Earth are six or fewer

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,500
acquaintances apart.

57
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,366
Why is this important?

58
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:15,033
Why do I tell you this?

59
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,465
Well, it's an important
lesson for us in business

60
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,132
and government as well.

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,566
While Kevin Bacon has a max of
six links to a connection, I'd

62
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:27,266
propose that businesses
might max out at two links.

63
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,199
We very much have entered
into an era where all of our

64
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:35,099
collective actions or inactions
impact each other at a scale we

65
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,766
have never imagined.

66
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:42,500
In fact, look to your left,
now look to your right.

67
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,500
These might be your two
degrees of separation.

68
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,833
These people are your best
defense and potentially

69
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
your greatest weakness.

70
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:54,966
Never before in cybersecurity
have we had more interdependence

71
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:58,433
on each other for stopping
and limiting the impact

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,433
of a cyberattack.

73
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,199
I get asked, Chris, why is this happening, and what changed

74
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,899
to get us here?

75
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:08,066
I could say the attackers have
gotten more sophisticated or

76
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,366
they are better financed,
but that's cliché.

77
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,599
You've heard that before.

78
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,033
I think the answer
is more sobering.

79
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,599
Ransomware and its ubiquity and
ease of deployment has caught us

80
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,733
at our most vulnerable moment.

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Data theft is no longer
a lucrative business

82
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,399
model for attackers.

83
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,133
It is expensive, it's difficult
to monetize, and defenses have

84
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
been focusing on stopping it.

85
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,066
Ransomware has given criminals
a means to cut out the middleman

86
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,366
and move to the
direct payment model.

87
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:40,699
If the pandemic has taught us
anything, it is that our supply

88
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,800
chain is incredibly fragile,
and this did not go

89
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,699
unnoticed by attackers.

90
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,000
The best way to explain this is
to take a look at some of the

91
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,933
data from our 2022 X Force
Threat Intelligence Report.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,366
It showed manufacturing was the
most attacked industry last

93
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,199
year, unseating financial
services for the first time

94
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,833
in over five years.

95
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,566
Cyber criminals found a leverage
point in the critical role

96
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,899
manufacturers play in global
supply chains to pressure

97
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,533
victims into paying a ransom.

98
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,066
In fact, 23% of all attacks in
manufacturing were ransomware.

99
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,532
Attackers wagered on the ripple
effect that disruption on

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,399
manufacturers would cause
their customers and partners

101
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:24,066
pressuring them to
paying a ransom.

102
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,198
Ransomware attacks on
manufacturing are affecting

103
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,466
the bottom line, and
it's beginning to affect

104
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,600
consumers' household budgets.

105
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,633
How does this evolve?

106
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,100
Well, financially motivated
cyber criminals now have

107
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,500
critical infrastructure
in their sights.

108
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:44,133
The FBI, CISA, NSA observed
incidents involving ransomware

109
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,733
against 14 of the
16 U.S. critical

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,333
infrastructure sectors in 2021.

111
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,699
In 2022, we've already seen
similar disruptions in energy in

112
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:56,100
Europe with an attack
interrupting services at over

113
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,666
233 gas stations
in Germany alone.

114
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:03,600
Simply put, attackers have gone
from chasing data to hunting

115
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,500
for chain reactions.

116
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,799
All of us are feeling that
in our day-to-day lives.

117
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:12,300
Attackers found leverage in the
real-world repercussions, and I

118
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:16,199
argue they are not going to
go back to their old ways.

119
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:20,233
They will continue to push
our limits as a society.

120
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,766
Okay.

121
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:25,766
So, what do we have to do
better to defend ourselves?

122
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:30,733
I have some very unorthodox
advice, but please stay with me.

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,966
Last October for Cybersecurity
Awareness Month, Charles

124
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,333
Henderson, who heads up our IBM
X Force team, I'm sure he's in

125
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,733
the room somewhere, published a
byline in the Financial Times

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,566
that essentially told
businesses simply give up.

127
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:46,265
Exactly.

128
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,533
That's what I thought
when he shared this idea.

129
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,833
I said, Charles,
have you gone mad?

130
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,033
We can't tell our
clients give up.

131
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,500
But what Charles is really
saying is give up on trying to

132
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,032
keep attackers out.

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,866
We all need to change our
mindset to one that assumes the

134
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,866
attacker is already in,
finding their way to

135
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,332
your prized possessions.

136
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,300
Your focus should
be on detecting and

137
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,000
stopping the attackers.

138
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,899
I'm sure many of you are
hearing about this approach.

139
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,899
It's called Zero Trust.

140
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:18,066
I'd argue Zero Trust is not just
a "buzz" phrase, single action,

141
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,532
or tool the
industry is marketing.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,333
It is a set of
principles on which to

143
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,066
build a security strategy.

144
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,933
It is not something
you buy off the shelf.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,699
What else can we do as an
industry to combat this shift

146
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,100
with the real-world
ramifications now needing

147
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,899
to factor into our
cybersecurity programs?

148
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,166
I have an idea that I've been
bantering around since I met

149
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,966
with some of the clients
in the industrial space.

150
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,766
In fact, I'll bring one
out here in a moment.

151
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,266
I saw many of their meetings
beginning with what they called

152
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,266
a safety moment,
and it intrigued me.

153
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,800
Safety moments are considered a
critical element of workplace

154
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,500
safety in construction
and industrial settings.

155
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,299
I'm sure some of
you are familiar.

156
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,899
You begin a meeting, five to ten
minutes on a briefing, and focus

157
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,966
on anything related to the
wellbeing of the team.

158
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:07,533
This can cover safety
protocols, training, education,

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
and even mental health.

160
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:13,000
You have seen those signs at the
work site that talk about days

161
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,299
without an accident.

162
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:17,265
Those are part of that
safety moment as well.

163
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,399
I'd propose every company might
want to adopt this practice and

164
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,833
call it a security moment
to discuss cybersecurity

165
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,800
at the beginning of
every single meeting.

166
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:29,066
Cybersecurity is now a shared
risk across every department of

167
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,466
a company or institution.

168
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,966
It does not just
sit with the CISO.

169
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:38,033
Security needs to be a top
agenda for all departments.

170
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,000
As I shared earlier, the
continuing kinetic effects of

171
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,466
security events are elevating
our monetary risk, but more

172
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:48,899
convincing is their potential
physical risk to our employees

173
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,566
and our customers.

174
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,366
So, its time we start connecting
security and safety into

175
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,466
the same conversation.

176
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,200
To help bring this to life for
you, I'm fortunate enough to

177
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,766
have CISOs from two of our
largest companies who are a

178
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,299
critical part of the
global supply chain.

179
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:07,600
Please join me in welcoming to
the stage Fernando Madureira,

180
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,666
CISO for Cosan, Charles
Tango, CISO for Sysco Foods.

181
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:25,565
Grab a seat.

182
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,966
Gentlemen, thank you for
joining us here today.

183
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,433
You just heard my kickoff here
about the real-world impact

184
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,366
cybersecurity is now having
on our physical world.

185
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,233
Both of your companies are
critical and vital to the global

186
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,366
supply chain in different ways.

187
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,100
First, Fernando, I want to pose
a question to you about Cosan.

188
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:46,299
Cosan Group is a huge part of
the Brazilian economy, critical

189
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:49,100
infrastructure with diverse but
integrated businesses in the

190
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,433
energy sector, including
fuel and natural gas, also

191
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,700
complemented by logistics
and agribusiness.

192
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:59,866
How do you manage security
across the different businesses

193
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,665
and help 60,000 employees
keep your business secure?

194
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:05,733
>> FERNANDO MADUREIRA:
Thank you, Chris.

195
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,433
Good morning, everyone.

196
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a pleasure to be here.

197
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:14,700
So, yeah, it's a huge group with
amazing companies, and I'm proud

198
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,466
to be part of Cosan
Group, of course.

199
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:26,733
So, the way we are doing that,
we have diverse operations and

200
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,699
business, as you said, so we
have energy, we have renewables,

201
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,000
we have logistics
and transportation,

202
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,433
lubricants, natural gas.

203
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,166
So, they are all
different, right?

204
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,699
And they have their teams
and different operations.

205
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,165
So, just to give you some
examples on who you are, right,

206
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:53,866
so we are moving at least 50% of
the economy in Brazil through

207
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,233
our trains and our logistics.

208
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,399
So, it's a big deal.

209
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:04,066
And on the other hand, if we
are a country, we would be the

210
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,000
second largest sugar
producer in the planet.

211
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,533
So, it's huge.

212
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,799
So, what we are doing and
how we are putting in place

213
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,566
our governance there.

214
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:19,233
We established two central
teams, so we have an information

215
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,632
security team, and we have a
cyber defense team, and they are

216
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,500
acting across all of the group
companies, sharing intelligence,

217
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:31,266
process, standards, and then we
can make sure everybody will be

218
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:36,100
at the minimal level as a group,
right, but then we have the

219
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,700
BISOs, the business information
security officer, that I am

220
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,799
sure most of you know
already this, but in Brazil,

221
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,399
this is quite new.

222
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:46,733
It's not common to see
BISO in Latin America.

223
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,600
So, we need them, of course.

224
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,100
They are there in the
business, in the operations.

225
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,899
They are listening to them,
helping them to take

226
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:53,966
decisions every day.

227
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:59,233
Now, I have two takeaways,
actually, to share

228
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,299
with you guys.

229
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:04,833
So, my first takeaway
is on the M&A process.

230
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,933
We must be the enabler, not the
blocker in the M&A process, but

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,833
we have to make sure we are
there, part of the M&A process.

232
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,833
Why?

233
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,866
Because we have to help the
business to identify in both

234
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,733
companies what is the situation,
the risks in place, and then we

235
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,366
have the commitment from them
to fix that in a timeline.

236
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:30,500
And more than that, we can even
document this and be transparent

237
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,433
with our regulators.

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,466
You can imagine we have a lot
of regulators in the group.

239
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:39,633
So, on the day one after the
M&A, everybody knows already

240
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,166
what is the situation.

241
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,933
So, that's my
takeaway number one.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,833
Now, my takeaway number two is
about supply chain security and

243
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,799
vendor risk management.

244
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:57,366
So, the point is I see everybody
really focusing on assessing the

245
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:01,766
vendors, assessing the risks,
the suppliers, and enforcing

246
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,199
them pretty much to fix the
things because we have the

247
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,799
security, but they have
to be also with a high

248
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,766
security level there, too.

249
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,665
So, but most of the time, what
I see, we really need to take a

250
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:19,065
second step here because we are
enforcing them to do so many

251
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,666
things, and sometimes,
or most of the time,

252
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,665
it's a different company.

253
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,933
They are a small company.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,033
They don't have the same
budget or even they don't

255
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,500
have security people.

256
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:31,666
So, I'm making my guys available
to help them, and I'm bringing

257
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:35,866
them to our ecosystem,
including trainings.

258
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,899
We are doing phishing testing
with them, we are bringing them,

259
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:42,866
for example, to our crisis
management exercises, and we are

260
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46,633
giving them our process, our
procedures, so they have to be

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,500
part of our ecosystem.

262
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:51,600
>> CHRIS McCURDY: Thanks
for that, Fernando.

263
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,166
Our teams are seeing firsthand
the efforts you're putting in,

264
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,099
and proud to partner
with you and Cosan.

265
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,899
Charles, you heard from Fernando
how he manages security for such

266
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,266
a critical part of
the Brazilian economy.

267
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,733
Interestingly, Sysco Foods and
the whole food services industry

268
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,466
is now considered
critical infrastructure

269
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,633
by the government.

270
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
It's obvious why.

271
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,133
You play a critical role in
keeping our families nourished.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,100
So, question to you: With this
new focus, what are you and your

273
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,600
peers doing differently?

274
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,000
>> CHARLES TANGO:
Thank you, Chris.

275
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:27,200
First of all, let me say that
the food services industry takes

276
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,299
cybersecurity very seriously
and we have for a while.

277
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:33,433
Clearly, the JBS Meats incident,
which occurred roughly around

278
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,600
the same time as Colonial
Pipeline, was a seminal moment

279
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,466
for our industry, and the
designation of critical

280
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,700
infrastructure is meaningful,
but I wouldn't call either of

281
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,399
those gamechangers for us.

282
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:48,600
We had been focusing on cyber
risk for an extended period of

283
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:53,000
time; however, that doesn't
mean that we aren't doing

284
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:56,166
some things differently
because we clearly are.

285
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:00,299
In fact, if you think about how
we were categorizing our risks

286
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,033
in the past, five years ago, we
probably would have been focused

287
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,066
on data exfiltration or
regulatory compliance, whereas

288
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:09,700
now we are clearly more
focused on ransomware.

289
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:12,132
It's hard to ignore that
as your primary risk.

290
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,100
And what that means is you
start looking at your programs

291
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,733
that support detection,
response, prevention.

292
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,632
You have to take that as kind of
the north star in how you are

293
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,600
defining those programs.

294
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:28,266
I would also say that if you
look at how we are managing

295
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,500
where we deployed our
cybersecurity resources, we were

296
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:35,366
probably focused on our own
digital perimeter, and now we

297
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:39,566
are hyper-focused on the
interconnected supply chain, and

298
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:44,200
it's hard to dismiss the cyber
risks associated with that.

299
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,099
What is interesting, though, if
you think about it, those risks

300
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,133
are not unique to our industry.

301
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,566
Most of the CISOs in this room
and the security professionals

302
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:55,899
in this room would probably cite
those as their top concerns.

303
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:59,200
And because of that, I think the
most important resource that a

304
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:02,533
CISO can have is a
strong peer network.

305
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,866
I regularly collaborate with
other large organizational CISOs

306
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,200
across a number of industries.

307
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:12,132
We have similar challenges, and
we have similar solutions, so

308
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,899
it's important to collaborate
and share those ideas.

309
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,233
>> CHRIS McCURDY:
Thanks, Charles.

310
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,733
Our food supply chain really
has become frontpage news.

311
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,100
Interesting to hear your
perspectives on how while things

312
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,799
seemed to have changed,
their priorities really do

313
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,165
remain the same.

314
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,599
Fernando, the attack
surface is expanding beyond

315
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,399
our wildest imagination.

316
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:33,299
In fact, IBM just
announced our plans to buy

317
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,799
a company called Randori.

318
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,566
That happened just yesterday.

319
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,566
Simple challenge
for you, Fernando.

320
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:43,333
You've shared the importance
of ESG, how, at Cosan, it's

321
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,799
impacting the environment from
the very front, and I know you

322
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:50,633
were working closely with us on
OT and it's been a new challenge

323
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,766
for you with your
attack surface.

324
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,399
You're clearly leveraging those
tools to help meet your goals

325
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,100
with the environmental safety.

326
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,833
So, tell me, how are you
managing the expanding attack

327
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,033
surface area that OT
environments are creating?

328
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,833
>> FERNANDO MADUREIRA:
Good question, Chris.

329
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,099
So, yeah, ESG agenda is high
priority for us at Cosan.

330
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,500
Right?

331
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:12,433
And cybersecurity, information
security is part of the ESG

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,032
scope and agenda.

333
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:19,933
So, the way we are doing it is
we did a big, huge step on the

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,833
IT part, on the IT environment
with those teams and everything

335
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,400
we are doing with our cyber
defense center and the BISOs

336
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:27,465
and all of that.

337
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:31,966
Now, for the OT environment,
from my point of view,

338
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,966
it's a completely
different environment.

339
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:38,666
Of course, we have operations,
we have PLC devices, systems.

340
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,799
Just to give you some idea, we
have more than 100,000 connected

341
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:46,666
devices, IoT, OT, and
all of those devices.

342
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,500
So, it's huge. Right?

343
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:52,733
So, we are partnering with IBM,
doing now the biggest project,

344
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,366
really focusing on OT
security right now.

345
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:59,933
So, in my perspective, the
technical part, of course, you

346
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,833
are going to find challenges and
roadblocks, but I'm sure we are

347
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,599
going to find solutions always.

348
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,700
Right?

349
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:12,200
But my takeaway on that question
is we have another challenge

350
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:15,366
that we need to watch out,
and that challenge is on the

351
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:18,433
employees and the people
working on the operations.

352
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,666
Right?

353
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,133
Imagine, they have been working
for years and years and years

354
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,533
pretty much focusing on
availability of the systems.

355
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,200
Right?

356
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,733
Now we have to teach them cyber.

357
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,500
Now we have to tell them why
they have to listen to us, that

358
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,233
we need to stop a system, or
we need to apply a patch in a

359
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,766
system that has been running
for 50 years or even more.

360
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,866
Right?

361
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:44,099
So, for me, that's my
takeaway and recommendation.

362
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,033
>> CHRIS McCURDY:
That's fantastic.

363
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,966
So, Charles, like Fernando and
Cosan, I know computing is also

364
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,699
everywhere in the food industry.

365
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:54,299
I have to imagine connected
trucks, refrigerators, and the

366
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,766
other machinery that
is part of your expanding

367
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,866
your attack surface.

368
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,533
What are some of the best
strategies you're seeing to be

369
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,433
applied to manage OT
and IoT environments?

370
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,700
>> CHARLES TANGO: So, OT is not
really a new attack surface.

371
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:08,799
It's existed for a while.

372
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:11,333
What is new is our recognition
of it being an attack surface.

373
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,700
I think that's an
important note.

374
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:17,966
But similarly to what I said
before, that's not a risk that's

375
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,533
unique to our industry.

376
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,700
And as a good example of that,
food is perishable and

377
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,166
can need refrigeration.

378
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:28,933
You mentioned cold chain
in your presentation.

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,266
That's something that
pharmaceutical companies and

380
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,200
logistics companies, they have
been addressing those risks for

381
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:38,099
a while, which means it's a
fantastic opportunity for us to

382
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,000
leverage their lessons learned,
and we have done so in

383
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,466
building our programs.

384
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,832
One of the fundamental things is
the sooner you recognize that

385
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,000
your challenges are not
necessarily unique, the sooner

386
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,900
you can start leveraging
the work that other

387
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,733
people have done.

388
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,500
I think we are seeing
two broad themes.

389
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:59,133
First would be the external
third-party management of OT

390
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
devices appears to be
increasing, and the always on

391
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,833
and probably more importantly
the full connectivity,

392
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,266
especially external
connectivity of OT devices.

393
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,066
And while I won't go into the
specifics that we are using to

394
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,533
address some of those risks,
there are some fundamental

395
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,866
things such as ensuring
proper segmentation.

396
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,266
That's been a key control
for a while and will continue

397
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,599
to be a key control.

398
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,666
I also think organizations
typically overlook including OT

399
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,000
in their incident response.

400
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,666
And frankly, that's one of the
easiest things that you can work

401
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,866
on because it is
based on playbooks.

402
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:34,099
And finally, Zero Trust, which I
know is a "buzz" word, but it's

403
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,966
a buzz word for a reason.

404
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,332
>> CHRIS McCURDY: Very good.

405
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,733
Charles and Fernando, thank
you so much for your insights.

406
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,599
It's rare we get to see the
inside and look at how leaders

407
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,899
like yourselves are managing the
coming together of the business

408
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:49,500
resiliency and cybersecurity
goals of major global companies

409
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,533
to help to protect
the supply chain.

410
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,533
Some critical
lessons for us all.

411
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,099
Let's give both of them
a round of applause.

412
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:55,799
Thank you.

413
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:56,533
(Applause).

414
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,233
>> CHRIS McCURDY: So, as we've
been talking about in this

415
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:07,366
session, we're dealing with
levels of unpredictability in

416
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,933
every area of business,
and cybersecurity has no

417
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,366
shortage of it.

418
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,099
The interconnectedness
we discussed here is

419
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,500
not slowing down.

420
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,166
It is only growing
exponentially.

421
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:22,265
As Fernando and Charles
described, they are a big part

422
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,500
of an even bigger
interdependent network.

423
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm sure many of you
have the same challenges.

424
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:32,799
As consumers and citizens, we
also feel the interconnectedness

425
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:36,033
in our days that
we have to handle.

426
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,700
The big takeaway for me
here is around resetting our

427
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:41,099
perspectives on cybersecurity.

428
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,733
We need to assume
we are breached.

429
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,299
We need to hunt for the threats.

430
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,500
But more importantly, we need
to understand our place in the

431
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,766
stability of this world.

432
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,133
Now let's make those security
moments a reality in our

433
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,633
meetings every single day, help
ensure our teams can celebrate

434
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,266
hundreds of days without
a security incident.

435
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,099
Thank you all for joining us
today and have a fantastic show.

436
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,366
Thank you.
