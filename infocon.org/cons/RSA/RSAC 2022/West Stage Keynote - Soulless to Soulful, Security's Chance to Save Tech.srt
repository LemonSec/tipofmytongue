00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,233
>> SPEAKER: Please welcome
Chief Executive Officer,

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,666
Trellix, Bryan Palma.

3
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,666
>> BRYAN PALMA: Social media
has become a destructive

4
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,966
force in our lives.

5
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,666
It is tearing people apart,
sowing division between

6
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:37,898
families, friends,
and associates.

7
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:43,266
It is fueling a rise in hate
speech and disinformation,

8
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,833
sparking a surge
in online harassment

9
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,366
and real-life violence.

10
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:53,866
It is wreaking havoc on our
children's self-esteem,

11
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:59,100
triggering an increase in
anxiety, depression, and other

12
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,333
serious social disorders.

13
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
But worst of all, today's
social media companies are

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,233
taking little action.

15
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,599
Driven by greed, stricken with
apathy, they have revealed

16
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,765
themselves as soulless.

17
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,833
Take a look at these
recent headlines.

18
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,133
The moral bankruptcy
of Facebook.

19
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:30,900
How Instagram is
hurting teen girls.

20
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:35,532
Outrage spreads
faster on Twitter.

21
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,700
Their users, you and
I, we have had enough.

22
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,633
We recognize the enormous
negative impact social media is

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,400
having on our society, not to
mention our mental health.

24
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:56,433
According to a 2021 Quinnipiac
University poll, 70% of people

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,766
say social media does
more harm than good - 70%.

26
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,799
People are worried
about what is going on.

27
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:13,166
Clearly, these social media
companies have lost their way.

28
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,400
Founded on the promise of
bringing the world closer

29
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:20,566
together and fostering
community, these companies

30
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:26,400
attracted countless smart,
talented people who wanted to be

31
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,800
part of that very mission.

32
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:33,366
But today, many of these
employees have come to the

33
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:38,333
realization that social
media often does more to

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,866
sever than unite.

35
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:45,965
Working for these companies no
longer aligns with their values.

36
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:52,698
And as a result, they are
leaving their jobs in droves.

37
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:58,198
They are in search of more
soulful work, work they can be

38
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:04,866
proud of, work that offers them
a higher purpose, work providing

39
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:11,766
a chance to change the world,
work like cybersecurity.

40
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:16,699
Honestly, what is more soulful
than protecting people, than

41
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:20,599
stopping hackers from trying to
take down insulin machines in

42
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:25,266
hospitals, than preventing bad
actors from limiting access to

43
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,666
clean water in Ukraine?

44
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:33,599
This movement from soulless
to soulful work presents an

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,666
incredible opportunity
for our industry.

46
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:43,466
Imagine if we could turn this
unraveling of social media into

47
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:48,333
a watershed moment for
us in cybersecurity.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,466
Imagine if we could come
together to create a home for

49
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:57,766
talented technologists seeking
a more fulfilling future.

50
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:02,599
With all of us singing the same
tune, there is no limit to the

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,933
number of hearts and
minds we could win.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,866
We could inspire ten thousand, a
hundred thousand, maybe even a

53
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:15,000
million people to
find their true calling

54
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:19,066
in cybersecurity with us.

55
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:23,566
Normally, at RSA, we discuss
important topics like artificial

56
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,698
intelligence, anti-ransomware,
and automation.

57
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:31,100
But today, I only want
to talk about people.

58
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:35,466
For 20 years now, we have
dealt with the same problem.

59
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:39,133
Our demand for security
analysts, engineers,

60
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,066
researchers, and consultants
far exceeds our supply.

61
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:48,466
And every single day, that
gap continues to grow.

62
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,666
I have long personally been
frustrated by the talent

63
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,833
shortages plaguing our industry.

64
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,399
I remember the frustration
I had early in my career while

65
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,199
at the Secret Service.

66
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,766
And now, 20 years later,
I have the exact same feelings

67
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,600
as the CEO of Trellix.

68
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:11,866
The most troubling aspect of all
this is how little progress we

69
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:14,099
have made as an industry.

70
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:18,300
For decades, we have relied
on the same tactics to

71
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:20,765
close the talent gap.

72
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:25,533
We refuse to do anything
different to solve this problem.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,533
It is the very
definition of insanity.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
In the U.S. and many other countries, we have not made

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,465
the investments required
to develop a national

76
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,399
cybersecurity talent pipeline.

77
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,633
Meanwhile, the very nation
states attacking our private

78
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,633
corporations, they have already
made those investments.

79
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,699
For years, they have
been training attackers

80
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,100
to assault our businesses.

81
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,433
And because we are behind when
it comes to talent, we struggle

82
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,833
to defend ourselves.

83
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,300
Even though I am fed up,
I am far from defeated.

84
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:07,633
I will stop at nothing to make
sure our industry develops the

85
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,333
diverse talent pipeline
necessary to address

86
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,466
our supply shortage.

87
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:18,799
Now, let's take a
look at the problem.

88
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:22,300
Last month at Trellix, we
partnered with a global market

89
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:27,099
research firm to survey 1,000
cybersecurity professionals.

90
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,633
We had a simple goal.

91
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,033
Understand the data to help
us better diagnose the problem

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,033
and design solutions.

93
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,500
Here is what we found - 78%
identified as male, 64%

94
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:49,066
identified as white, 89%
identified as straight.

95
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,099
No surprise there, right?

96
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,133
Straight white males
dominate our industry.

97
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,300
We are largely a
homogenized group.

98
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,599
But there is a serious
problem with that.

99
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:04,733
Our lack of diversity is holding
us back in two important ways.

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,066
First, we are turning away great
people and doing our industry a

101
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,532
significant disservice.

102
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,600
By failing to cultivate a more
inclusive environment and

103
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:20,366
neglecting to provide pathways
for more female and non-binary

104
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:24,933
people, people of color,
and people from the LGBTQ+

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,033
community, we are only widening
our already enormous talent gap.

106
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,000
We are all better when we
benefit from the diverse

107
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,032
perspectives of others.

108
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,133
Second, simply put, it
is bad for business.

109
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,300
I learned this decades
ago from Indra Nooyi,

110
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,933
the former PepsiCo CEO.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,899
We do not look like our
customers and our lack of

112
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:56,699
diversity restricts our
ingenuity, innovation, and

113
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:01,766
ability to recruit the
next generation of talent.

114
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,100
Hell, the hackers are
more diverse than we are.

115
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,733
Even they understand
the importance of having

116
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,933
a bigger tent.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Unfortunately, the survey data
related to people's educational

118
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:18,633
experience is equally
predictable - 95% obtained their

119
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,533
bachelor's degree, 85% majored
in IT, computer science, or

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,633
technology, 75% specialized
in cybersecurity.

121
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,533
These statistics tell me we are
falling short when it comes to

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,433
identifying talent with
a two-year degree or no

123
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,799
degree at all.

124
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,100
We are overlooking qualified
candidates who lack the

125
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:46,200
schooling but have earned
certifications or completed

126
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,899
other vocational training.

127
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:54,733
This bias is a huge mistake
and again restricts instead of

128
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,966
expands our talent pool.

129
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,899
There is an industry-wide
perception, especially among

130
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,833
recruiters, that our people
need a college education to be

131
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,766
successful, but many of the
cybersecurity professionals we

132
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,299
surveyed do not agree;
ninety-three percent report the

133
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,566
ability to develop their
own skills and learn in

134
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,966
their own spare time.

135
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,666
On the positive side, our
research revealed pathways from

136
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,433
other professions already exist.

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,233
Forty-five percent
previously spent time

138
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,966
in another profession.

139
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,366
Considering a large majority of
the people we surveyed had a

140
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:39,700
concentration in cybersecurity,
this finding was eye-opening.

141
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:42,799
Now, granted, many of these
respondents held positions in

142
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:46,799
fields closely related to
cybersecurity, like IT, computer

143
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,333
science, or software
development, but others

144
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,100
came from industries
as diverse as finance,

145
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,166
retail, and manufacturing.

146
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,500
Here is what excited
me the most, though.

147
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:03,866
More than a handful of people
made the move from social media

148
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,200
to cybersecurity.

149
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,366
For years, we have been focused
on hiring the same types of

150
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,665
people with the same types of
educational experiences and

151
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,899
professional backgrounds.

152
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:20,833
But as Adam, our Chief Revenue
Officer, often says with a

153
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,700
distinctly British accent,
we need some fresh water

154
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,565
in our pond.

155
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,633
He is right.

156
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,766
We need to start making
inroads into new communities.

157
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,866
We need to tap into
more diverse groups.

158
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:39,533
We need to rethink
who we view as talent.

159
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,133
Over the past two decades,
we have given the talent and

160
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,066
diversity gap lots of lip
service, yet we still lack

161
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:52,866
any scalable programs
to close that gap.

162
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:56,933
I know from implementing
programs at Trellix, there are

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,100
three discrete populations
we must nurture and develop.

164
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:06,733
First, we have to transform the
current K-12 educational system

165
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,132
both at home and abroad.

166
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,466
According to our research, 94%
of people agree we should do

167
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:19,100
more to raise awareness of
cybersecurity at an earlier age.

168
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,733
Beginning in kindergarten, we
should infuse cybersecurity into

169
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,632
students' existing curriculum.

170
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,166
As kids advance through school,
they would have the opportunity

171
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:34,233
to take standalone classes, join
clubs, attend day camps, or

172
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,466
participate in competitions
focused on cybersecurity.

173
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:41,966
This K-12 plan is a long-term
investment, but one that will

174
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,666
surely pay dividends, especially
when it comes to breaking

175
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:50,333
down social, economic,
and diversity barriers.

176
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,966
Second, we have to better
nurture and train college

177
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,266
students and early in
career professionals.

178
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,565
With an increase in scholarship
funding and internship programs,

179
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,333
we would enable more
people to pursue academic

180
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
opportunities in cybersecurity.

181
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:11,132
And by extending program
participation to include more

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,033
Historically Black Universities,
liberal arts schools, and

183
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,133
community colleges, we could
achieve an even larger, more

184
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,033
diverse talent pool.

185
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,399
In our survey, 92% of
respondents agreed more

186
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:30,033
internships would encourage more
people from diverse backgrounds

187
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,799
to enter into cybersecurity.

188
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:37,066
For young adults who lack
education, we could provide

189
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,299
entryways to cybersecurity
through the establishment of

190
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:44,466
federal programs, offering
cybersecurity training coupled

191
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:47,299
with grants and tax breaks.

192
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,799
Third, we have to create avenues
for mid-career professionals

193
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:56,000
seeking to make the
move into cybersecurity.

194
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,666
Whether they come looking for
more meaningful work from a

195
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,099
Silicon Valley tech company or a
small-town restaurant in Middle

196
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:07,233
America, we need to ease
the transition for them.

197
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,132
As an industry, we have to
provide better access to

198
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,466
courses, so people can
adequately reskill.

199
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,933
We have to promote quality
certification programs, so

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,666
potential candidates can
enhance their knowledge.

201
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,433
And we need to launch more
apprenticeships, so prospective

202
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,933
employees can acquire
tangible skills directly

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,233
from our experts.

204
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:35,533
At the end of the day, success
does not depend on a degree.

205
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,966
Don't believe me?

206
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,299
More than half the
people in our survey

207
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,766
agreed with that statement.

208
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,833
We should be at the front
line recruiting capable

209
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,899
technologists, whether or not
they have a college degree.

210
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:54,000
The reality is this: Our
industry is best served by

211
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:59,299
people with tenacity, will, and
determination, people who refuse

212
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:04,833
to settle, people who seek a
higher purpose, people like

213
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:08,500
Raphael and Noelle.

214
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,333
Raphael was in high
school when he first

215
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,133
learned about cybersecurity.

216
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,899
As a sophomore, he took
a class on the subject.

217
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:18,700
Later, while studying electrical
engineering in college, he got a

218
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:23,000
call about taking on a security
contract in Afghanistan.

219
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,399
Today, he is living
his dream as a

220
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,833
principal cybersecurity architect.

221
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,566
As a 14-year-old kid, Raphael
had no idea that one high school

222
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:38,000
class would change the
course of his entire life.

223
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:42,399
Noelle was a bartender in 2005
when she started building

224
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,766
websites for her
friends' businesses.

225
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,933
With a couple young kids in
diapers, this work perfectly

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,066
suited her needs as she
could work while her children

227
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,166
slept at night.

228
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,299
She cared about the websites she
built and wanted nothing more

229
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:58,566
than to learn how
to protect them.

230
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:02,733
This inquisitive nature
led her on the path to IT.

231
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,966
When that failed to scratch her
curiosity itch, she made the

232
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,066
switch to cybersecurity.

233
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,899
Now, as a senior site
reliability engineer, she is not

234
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:16,733
only keeping websites safe; she
is keeping the world safe for

235
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,699
both her kids and ours.

236
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:24,199
What do people like Raphael
and Noelle have in common?

237
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,632
They are go-getters.

238
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,066
They managed to achieve what
they did not because we helped

239
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,399
them, but because
they had fortitude,

240
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,933
curiosity, and passion.

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,799
Today, there are maybe
10 Raphaels, 10 Noelles.

242
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:41,633
But we don't want
10, 20, or even 100.

243
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,799
We want 100,000, and it
is our job as an industry

244
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,799
to make it happen.

245
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:51,600
I've challenged my team at
Trellix to lead with action, and

246
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,899
I'm proud of the work we are
doing with Gotara to advance the

247
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,899
careers of women in STEM.

248
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:02,299
And today, I want to announce a
new partnership with HACE, the

249
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,100
Hispanic Alliance for Career
Enhancement, to create a

250
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:09,766
cybersecurity accelerator
program for Latinos who,

251
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,366
unfortunately, only represent
2% of the respondents

252
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,066
in our survey.

253
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,799
Try as we might, none of us
can solve our problem alone.

254
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:24,933
It is impossible for any
one organization to close

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,700
our current talent
and diversity gap.

256
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,599
But collectively, we can
absolutely make a difference.

257
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,266
In trying to come up with a
solution, I started looking

258
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,833
at other industries
for inspiration.

259
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,299
What other industry
understood you could both

260
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,500
compete and collaborate?

261
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:48,233
Then I remembered this: In the
1970's, the consumption of soda,

262
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,500
juice, and other beverages
started soaring; meanwhile,

263
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:57,033
milk, a staple in refrigerators
everywhere since the 1950's, was

264
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,033
suddenly on the decline.

265
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,366
This trend continued
for 20 years.

266
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:07,465
Finally, in 1993, the industry
decided to come together.

267
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,733
Dairy processors united
to form the California

268
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,532
Milk Processor Board.

269
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:17,332
Their mission, to put an end to
the plummeting sales of milk.

270
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,533
The board
created the iconic

271
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,433
"Got Milk?" campaign.

272
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,133
By the very next year,
milk sales increased by

273
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,133
15 million gallons,
saving the milk industry.

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,433
We need our own campaign, one
where we put aside our own self

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,466
interests for the greater
good of the industry.

276
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,466
With a captivating campaign
focused on our positive

277
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:45,500
contributions to society, we
can use our collective voice

278
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:51,033
to cast a wider net to close
the current talent gap.

279
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,299
Just like at your organization,
Trellix is full of people who

280
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,799
are passionate about
the work we do.

281
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:00,366
Intending to prime the pump
for this campaign, I asked the

282
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,266
Trellix team to share their
stories on why working

283
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,033
in cybersecurity
gives them purpose.

284
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,466
Introducing "I Do Soulful Work."

285
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,466
>> SPEAKER: With all the turmoil
in the world, especially right

286
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,899
now, there's a lot of upheaval,
a lot of chaos, a lot of

287
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,399
cyberattacks, just moving that
needle a little bit, it's -

288
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,699
it's what I think
we're all in it for.

289
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:27,933
>> SPEAKER: It's a
pervasive threat.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,299
It's something where every
little action we take daily

291
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:35,033
contributes to improving
people's lives.

292
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,566
>> SPEAKER: I live here.

293
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,033
My kids live here.

294
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,666
My friends live here.

295
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:44,099
It doesn't get any more personal
than protecting your home.

296
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,399
>> SPEAKER: I realized that
cybersecurity was the next

297
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:49,433
battleground and that we just
needed to fight the good fight.

298
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,700
>> SPEAKER: You're helping
someone who is a victim and is

299
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,533
in a very bad place.

300
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,765
Things have been
stolen from them.

301
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,233
I mean, I get excited to go
to work to stop the bad guys.

302
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,333
>> SPEAKER: Building that next
generation of talent so that we

303
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,033
have a pipeline for our
leaders of tomorrow.

304
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,733
>> SPEAKER: Even though I may
sit behind a desk or I may not

305
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,766
be in that battlefield, I'm
really helping them protect

306
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,766
themselves as well and protect
what we do and how we live.

307
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,700
>> SPEAKER: Tenacity and
tenaciousness, by invoking that

308
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:22,566
and embracing it, you
can make people's lives

309
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,533
much more efficient.

310
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,700
>> SPEAKER: I'd like for my own
daughters and young women, young

311
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,533
minorities, to feel like they
belong in this space, they

312
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,765
belong in cybersecurity or STEM.

313
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,833
>> SPEAKER: Legacy.

314
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,833
All of us have a responsibility
to leave the world a better

315
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,366
place than how we found it.

316
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,933
>> SPEAKER: I'm excited to see
where the journey takes us so

317
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,666
that we can further help
execute the mission.

318
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,299
>> SPEAKER: I really feel like
sometimes it's the good guys

319
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:49,000
versus the bad guys, and I get
to be one of the good guys.

320
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,133
>> BRYAN PALMA: I have this
vision for the future, one that

321
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,599
looks vastly different from
the world we know today.

322
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:06,000
I see organizations across our
industry working hand in hand,

323
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,133
partners, competitors.

324
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,799
They are producing a barrage of
"I Do Soulful Work" content.

325
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:16,700
They are sharing their stories,
inspiring others to heed a

326
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,700
higher calling to
protect the world.

327
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,099
They are motivating people
to blaze their own

328
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,033
trail in cybersecurity.

329
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,133
I see a kaleidoscope of people,
people of color, people from the

330
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,466
LGBTQ+ community,
non-binary people.

331
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,933
They are coming to
us from two-year

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,700
schools and apprenticeships.

333
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,666
They are offering
fresh perspectives.

334
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,633
They are enriching lives.

335
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,099
They are defending innocent
people from having their

336
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,299
information stolen
in a data breach.

337
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,299
They are warding off attacks and
keeping a country's power grid

338
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,466
up and running.

339
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,632
They are protecting non-profits
and allowing them to safely

340
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,933
process donations.

341
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,333
They are doing soulful work,
just like you do soulful work,

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,733
and I do soulful work.

343
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,833
Thank you.

344
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,566
(Applause).
