00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:06,880
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,480
- Our next contestant, solving security

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,219
for hybrid work and unmanaged devices

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,220
co-founder and CEO of
Talon Cyber Security,

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,405
please welcome Ofer Ben Noon.

7
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:29,959
(audience applauding)
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,330
What's up? Welcome.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,162
Thanks for being here.

10
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:32,995
- Thank you very, very much.

11
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,550
- Right. Good luck.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,559
And Ofer your time begins

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,393
right now.

14
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:40,274
- Yeah.

15
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,363
Thank you.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,879
Ohad and I had a dream to solve
a very big problem together.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,670
And in April of 2020, Microsoft
moved edge to chromium

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,600
and created the opportunity.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,433
Let me explain.

20
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:59,513
Imagine you build a beautiful new home.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,399
You install safe to protect
your personal items.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,130
You place sensors on
the windows and a camera

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,130
inside your doorbell, but
your front door is left open?

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,490
All of us have some version of this

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,789
in our environment today.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,000
Amazing technologies built
to solve an expending attack

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,270
surface, but your browser
is your front door

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,110
for hybrid workers,
contractors, subsidiaries

29
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,610
and your supply chain.

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,810
In many cases using devices,
you cannot enforce your

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,933
security policy on and what
do they bring with them?

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,900
Risk and it's growing.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,733
Why?

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,310
In every presentation this
week you'll hear hybrid work up

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,993
SAAS adoption up, third
party contractors up.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,533
So it's time to shut the front door.

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,610
Based on the chromium open
source with five pattern spending

38
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,520
Talon Secure Enterprise
Browser is isolated

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,039
from the end point

40
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,540
and protected against
malicious manual activity.

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,983
And the user experience
is finally seamless.

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,519
Talon has advanced
security features like DLP,

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,270
Network Visibility and
Control, Web Zero Trust,

44
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,240
SAAS Security and Isolation.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,783
All built-in.

46
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,770
Talon delivers a unique high granularity

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,950
of visibility and control
across all web services.

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,619
SAS and on-prem sanctioned and shadow IT.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,940
Talon is deployed in minutes.

50
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,630
It's seamless for the end-user

51
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,650
and for the security team.

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,863
Dramatically reducing complexity and cost.

53
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,440
The CSO can finally ensure
a consistent security policy

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,303
for any user, in any
location, on any device.

55
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,520
Ohad and I have each
previously built cybersecurity

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,080
companies that became category leaders.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,420
And the massive opportunity
for this technology

58
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,220
has attracted the world class team.

59
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,609
The CMO from Crowdstrike and Cyberark,

60
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,010
the sales leader from Insights and McAfee,

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,899
the best engineers we have ever worked

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,220
with and fantastic advisors and investors.

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,350
We are a Crowdstrike partner

64
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,950
including the Microsoft startup program,

65
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,480
deployed in over 40
organizations and already working

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,149
with some of the largest
organizations in the world.

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,090
Please come and see us right over there

68
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,510
and we'll show you how

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,755
to shut the front door.

70
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:39,875
Thank you.

71
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:44,060
(audience applauding)
- Wow. Very nice.

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,600
I like the pause, man.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,722
You did the pause to get
in just to one second.

74
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,754
That's a pro move.

75
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:54,337
(upbeat music)
