00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,610
- No code automation for security teams.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,660
Please welcome CTO of
Torq, Leonid Belkind.

4
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:19,209
(upbeat electronic music)

5
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,288
(crowd clapping)

6
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,121
- Welcome.

7
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:23,953
- Hey, thank you.

8
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:24,810
- Thanks so much for being here.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,642
- Thank you.

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,720
It's a huge pleasure.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,200
- Leonid, your time begins...

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,093
right now, go.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,060
- Managing a cyber security
program means having to deal

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,770
with a lot of incoming events,
and I'm not only referring

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,220
to the traditional
incident response, but also

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,560
to handling things such
as threat intel feeds,

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,650
vulnerability reports, cloud
security posture findings,

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,920
privilege escalation
requests, and many more.

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,600
All of them require
follow up action items.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,590
In many cases, whole processes
that cross the boundaries

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,110
of just our security team

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,560
and require involving
additional role players.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,190
As the organizations become more digital

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,040
and go to hybrid clouds, the
variety and the intensity

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,730
of these events only grows.

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,760
Good news, right?

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,210
Leaving the cyber security practitioners

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,169
with a couple of basic choices.

29
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,610
Either you subscribe to
handling manually more and more

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,770
and more of them, obviously
not a very scalable choice

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,830
or considering the scarcity
of security talent,

32
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,880
even not a feasible one,
or you have to choose to

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,140
adopt an existing
traditional automation tool,

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,470
which requires software
engineering talent,

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,210
project management coordination,

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,039
and incurs non-trivial costs.

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,770
At Torq, we believe that enabling

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,009
every security practitioner
with the ability

39
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,430
to express their daily routines

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,773
in a visual, no code manner,

41
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,880
to deliver production grade
automations within minutes,

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
is a game changer to their ability to deal

43
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,330
with all these events today
and actually to be ready

44
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,600
for whatever the future may have in store.

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,270
Our architecture is inspired

46
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,550
by modern cloud native CI/CD pipelines

47
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,880
and it transforms the no code logic

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,030
into a sequence of containerized jobs.

49
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,670
They can run anywhere, perform any action,

50
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,430
and do it in any environment
like private cloud

51
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,120
or public one.

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,650
Torq is designed to serve

53
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,550
as a central nervous system, of a sort,

54
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,820
for the security stack and is capable out

55
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,170
of the box to receive events
and data from any component

56
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,149
and to take actions on any other component

57
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,830
without the need for
dedicated plugins, add-ons,

58
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,540
or anything of that sort.

59
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,150
To allow practitioners build faster,

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,700
we come pre-charged out
of the box with thousands

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,750
of useful actions, data transformations,

62
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,970
and even processed templates.

63
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,830
But our goal is not only to build a tool.

64
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,700
We envision becoming a true partner

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,570
to the organizations that
embark on security automation

66
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,670
and help them build their strategy.

67
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,660
Both by using well known

68
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,049
and wildly accepted security frameworks

69
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,270
and by bringing in a community
of like-minded individuals,

70
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,160
tackling this non-trivial
challenge together.

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,170
You know, nothing you end
up doing only a handful

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,510
of times, will ever have
a fundamental impact

73
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,410
at the way you operate and
this is why we are so proud

74
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,010
to see a long lasting shift
in the way practitioners

75
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,359
using Torq start seeing their environment

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,210
as event driven machines.

77
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,340
When establishing the company, we dreamed

78
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,160
of building a significant vendor
with a long lasting impact

79
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,210
on the industry.

80
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,790
To support that vision,

81
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,810
we built a executive team consisting

82
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,890
of both product innovators

83
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,890
and seasoned go to market
and customer service people.

84
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,779
People who have meaningful,
long lasting impact

85
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,660
on their partners and customers.

86
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,350
We are Torq, together with the users,

87
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,760
we're transforming security with no code.

88
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,426
Join us.

89
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,259
(crowd clapping and cheering)

90
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,091
- [Host] Wow, man!

91
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,761
To the second.

92
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,648
- Was close.

93
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,746
- Exactly to the second.

94
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:36,856
- Was really close.

95
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:37,689
Amazing.

96
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:38,816
- Incredible, incredible.

97
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:39,903
- Amazing.

98
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,403
