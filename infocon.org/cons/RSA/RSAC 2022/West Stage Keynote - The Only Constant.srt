1
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:10,654
>> ANNOUNCER: And now, please

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,451
welcome Chief Executive Officer

3
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:16,226
RSA, Rohit Ghai.

4
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:31,055
>> ROHIT GHAI:
This is our story.

5
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,496
A story of change.

6
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:38,965
Now, change is a constant,
but it is not the only constant.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,031
And everybody wants change,
but nobody wants to change.

8
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:50,219
We human beings reluctantly
seek to transform in order 

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,978
to survive disruption.

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,416
But I think we’ve come
to use these terms loosely.

11
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:01,971
Disruption is an
unexpected external change.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,053
Unless it's a
surprise, it's not disruption.

13
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:11,556
Transformation is a rapid,
intentional, internal change.

14
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:15,163
Unless it's fast, it's
not transformation.

15
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,298
Disruptions
catalyze transformations.

16
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:24,876
Simply stated,
we humans are not

17
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,847
very good at hurrying through

18
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:30,961
change unless we
get a kick in the pants.

19
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:35,144
Vaccines don't get made in
a year unless the specter of a

20
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:37,198
million deaths looms.

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,630
Friends, welcome to
RSA Conference 2022.

22
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:49,027
It so great to be
back in 3D, isn't it? Yes?

23
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:58,275
Look, and we certainly should
not take this for granted.

24
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:02,732
And our theme
this year is transform.

25
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,775
And this conference that you
love and power is going through

26
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,050
its own transformation.

27
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,557
Crosspoint Capital has joined
existing investors Clearlake and

28
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:16,799
Symphony Technology Group to
invest in evolving and growing

29
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,549
this platform for all of us.

30
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:25,178
And now it’s a 100% independent
company and business and will be

31
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,625
an enduring force for the
cybersecurity community.

32
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:34,126
Now, since we met in person,
there have been countless

33
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:37,280
disruptions in the
cyber physical world.

34
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:43,898
The 2019 World Economic
Forum Global Risk Report had no

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,396
mention of a global pandemic.

36
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,923
The 2021 report did not say a
thing about a war with Russia.

37
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,949
Surprise.

38
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:56,521
Disruption.

39
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:01,269
Now, what is not a surprise is
that these physical disruptions

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,677
created digital ripples.

41
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:08,017
The pandemic triggered a
massive acceleration of digital.

42
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,694
We all know that.

43
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:12,310
Now it's a
digital transformation.

44
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:17,407
Before that, it was a digital “I
will take my own sweet time”

45
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:18,678
kind of change.

46
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,648
The Ukraine-Russia war has
a big cyber component to it.

47
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:30,020
Did you know that the Ukrainian
volunteer hacker army is three

48
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,822
times the size of
its physical army?

49
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:37,435
Now on the digital front,
last year has been the year of

50
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,938
ransomware, supply
chain attacks, and

51
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,597
disinformation campaigns.

52
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,299
And guess what?

53
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,217
These digital disruptions have
spilled over into our physical world.

54
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:52,609
You all remember
the massive lines at the gas

55
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,582
stations after the
colonial pipeline hack?

56
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,045
So, what does all
of this mean for us?

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,259
Well, despite all this talk
about balkanization and about

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,591
how far apart we are, we live in
a hyperconnected world, where

59
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:13,441
the physical and the digital
is now indistinguishable.

60
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,635
So even if you live in Taipei,
you need to worry about what is

61
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,911
happening in a
classroom in Texas.

62
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:26,224
And even if you shop in
Santiago, you do need to care

63
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:32,628
about the closure of eight
hundred Swedish supermarkets due

64
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,789
to the Kaseya cyberattack.

65
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:36,915
Okay?

66
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,462
So, all of this is pretty scary.

67
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:45,108
And I don't know about you, but
I have a teenager at home and I

68
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:48,049
can barely keep up with the
disruptions in the home front.

69
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:53,354
How on earth are we going
to keep up with this torrent of

70
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,833
global disruptions?

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:02,412
Well, disruption is a tough but
fair teacher in the Darwinian

72
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,701
school of survival.

73
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,392
Disruptions shape
transformations in three ways.

74
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,204
They show us
what does not change.

75
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,584
The constants.

76
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,279
They crystallize
what matters most.

77
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:18,832
The imperatives.

78
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,047
And they debunk
wrongly held beliefs.

79
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,582
The dogmas.

80
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:28,292
So, friends, over the next
few minutes, let's review three

81
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:32,903
simple insights we may learn
from a global cyber disruption.

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,510
First, care about constants.

83
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,925
So, in a world 
enamored with change,

84
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:44,573
why should we 
care about constants?

85
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:48,316
Well, constants are the
basis for scientific progress.

86
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:53,138
If disruption is a tough
teacher, constants are

87
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,937
that good friend that you
can always go to for help

88
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,817
to survive that class.

89
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:03,525
Amidst change,
constants anchor us.

90
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:07,062
They build – they
help us build solutions.

91
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:09,593
They give us a
platform to build solutions.

92
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,823
Let's review an example.

93
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,380
When the global pandemic hit
and a new pathogen ravaged our

94
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:19,890
world, we needed a solution
quicker than traditional

95
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,914
vaccines to teach our
bodies how to fight it.

96
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,728
Now, there are new
pathogens all the time.

97
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,232
What stays the same
though are the capabilities of

98
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,791
our human body.

99
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,885
That's the constant.

100
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:39,409
mRNA technology leverages
our bodies to make proteins that

101
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,397
look like the virus to
train our immune system.

102
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,087
And this technology has
been around for many decades.

103
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:51,166
But in 2020, its
time had arrived.

104
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:54,419
The pandemic was the impetus

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,900
and several 
enabling technologies

106
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,402
like nanotechnologies
had finally arrived.

107
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,895
So, by leveraging a constant,
we developed and distributed a

108
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:10,389
vaccine at warp speed.

109
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,622
Disruption
catalyzed a transformation.

110
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,481
So, what remains the
same in cybersecurity?

111
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,080
What is our constant?

112
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:26,275
Well, in cybersecurity, we
protect the ability of humans to

113
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:29,997
use technology to access
or create information.

114
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,895
Now, information 
changes all the time

115
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,133
and is growing exponentially.

116
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,225
In fact, just the last
year, we have created more

117
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,569
information than in all of
the years of our existence.

118
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:46,119
And technology powered by
Moore's law is ever changing.

119
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:52,429
And until Siri or Alexa start
writing code, I think technology

120
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:53,718
remains vulnerable.

121
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:57,427
So, there will
be new technology.

122
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,063
There will be
new vulnerabilities.

123
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:06,046
There will be new exploits and
there certainly will be malware

124
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:08,497
that leverages those exploits.

125
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,274
Don't get me wrong.

126
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:16,167
Shifting left, creating a more
resilient infrastructure, faster

127
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,952
disclosure of CVEs, and
faster patching, very positive.

128
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,419
But we are playing whack a mole.

129
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,153
The code we write and
run, our technology, changes

130
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:34,491
exponentially faster
than the code that runs us,

131
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,232
our genetic code.

132
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:42,766
What remains relatively
constant is us humans and how we

133
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:43,838
think and act.

134
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:51,639
As a sector, we have been built
for reactivity, chasing after

135
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,741
the next vulnerability or the
next threat or the next one.

136
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:57,682
Or the one after that.

137
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:03,680
Instead, to transform, we need
to build solutions based on the

138
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,149
one constant in cybersecurity.

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,897
Identity.

140
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:12,417
And the case for this
argument has also been

141
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,703
staring at us for decades.

142
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:18,759
Most cyber
attacks occur due to

143
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,137
compromised identity.

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,501
Most attacks can be blocked
by multi factor authentication.

145
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,817
And have you tried to
buy cyber insurance lately?

146
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:32,653
Today, they will not
even sell you insurance

147
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,079
if you don't have MFA.

148
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:41,444
So, similar to mRNA, MFA was
first commercially introduced

149
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,979
several decades ago in 1986.

150
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,112
We at RSA would
know, we pioneered it.

151
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:53,545
And despite consistently being
the number one recommended cyber

152
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:59,123
resilience measure by the
smartest amongst you, why are we

153
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:03,331
still at 50% adoption of
MFA even in the enterprise?

154
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,497
Well, there have been
several barriers to adoption.

155
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:14,046
The lack of open standards,
the user experience, the inertia

156
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,811
around passwords
have certainly held us back.

157
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,558
But now with the maturation of
passwordless technologies like

158
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,848
FIDO and the evolution of open
standards like Open ID Connect

159
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,043
and SCIM, I think it
is finally time to hold a

160
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,646
requiem for passwords.

161
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,738
How many cyberattacks are
we going to tolerate before we

162
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:44,044
adopt MFA for 100% of
actors on the network?

163
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,845
Look, while MFA is
important, it is not enough.

164
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,882
In a zero trust world, we need
to manage the who, the why, the

165
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:58,484
what, and the when of
identity in one platform.

166
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,607
And while a best of breed
strategy may work in other

167
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:08,154
areas, in identity, the
best approach is to use an

168
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:13,675
infrastructure agnostic
independent platform, a platform

169
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:19,070
that delivers 360 degree
coverage across access,

170
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:24,409
authorization, identity, 
lifecycle, governance

171
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,540
all of it.

172
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:30,140
And as we look to the
future, we have to worry about

173
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,855
applications like 
Web 3.0 based applications,

174
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,233
blockchain based applications.

175
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,631
And in that world, we
need to put the control of a

176
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:42,108
user's digital identity
back in their hands by

177
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:43,431
decentralizing it.

178
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:49,369
Identity is the one constant
in the world of cybersecurity.

179
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:52,037
Okay.

180
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,516
Insight number two.

181
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:57,627
Identify the imperatives.

182
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:02,274
Disruptions are great at
differentiating the important

183
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,606
from the imperative.

184
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,519
They shine a light 
on what matters most.

185
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:14,503
In 1960, life in Chile was
disrupted by an 8-plus Richter

186
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:19,722
scale earthquake and the death
toll was more than 2,000 to

187
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,286
3,000 human souls.

188
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:28,983
Five decades later, in 2015,
another 8-plus disrupter shakes

189
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:33,199
Chile and several
aftershocks of 6 and 7 follow.

190
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,143
The death toll?

191
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,483
Less than fifteen.

192
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:43,917
So, how did Chile become the
world's model for earthquake and

193
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,556
disaster preparedness?

194
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:50,387
General Ricardo Toro, who had,
by the way, lost his wife in

195
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:54,998
Haiti in an earthquake, led the
charge based on two insights.

196
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:56,965
Number one,

197
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,973
infrastructure damage,

198
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:01,343
economic recovery, important?

199
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,360
Absolutely.

200
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:06,849
But the imperative, the most
important thing you protect in

201
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,370
an earthquake is human life.

202
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:13,805
Number two, 
earthquakes don't kill people,

203
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,204
buildings and tsunamis do.

204
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:21,185
So, systematically, they
changed their building code,

205
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:25,578
implemented a clear evacuation
protocol, and reduced human

206
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,613
casualty by 100X.

207
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,977
100X relative to Nepal or Haiti.

208
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,784
So, what is the imperative in
the context of cybersecurity?

209
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:45,244
Well, during the pandemic,
CISA identified sixteen critical

210
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:49,986
infrastructure sectors
that are, well, important.

211
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:51,956
And critical.

212
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:58,247
Even during a cyber pandemic,
we must protect these sectors to

213
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:01,566
ensure humans have access to
their basic needs, food, water,

214
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,623
healthcare,
transportation, et cetera.

215
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,672
Now, in cyber, while
IT infrastructure is very

216
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:13,280
important, it can be
rebooted and replaced.

217
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:18,350
But if information is
lost, it is irreplaceable.

218
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:24,492
More significantly, though, if
information is tampered or if

219
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:29,312
misinformation is
spread, we get lost.

220
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:35,237
Hacked brains are way more
dangerous than hacked systems.

221
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:40,879
And our traditional mission
has been the confidentiality,

222
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:44,053
integrity, and
availability of information.

223
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:48,105
Addressing this is
largely a matter of disciplined

224
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:49,901
application of technology.

225
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:55,182
The new frontier, though,
is the veracity of information.

226
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:58,989
And addressing this
will require invention.

227
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:04,509
Take the recent and apparently
still current Twitter saga.

228
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:11,495
The intent of Mr. Musk to open
source the Twitter algorithm to

229
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,533
protect free speech, admirable.

230
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:21,205
The focus though, has rapidly
shifted towards identifying the

231
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,231
number of identifiable
humans on the platform versus

232
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:27,367
bots or cyborgs.

233
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:30,833
This is pivotal to
understanding the veracity of

234
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,589
information on the
platform and thereby the

235
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,213
valuation of the company.

236
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:41,308
Free speech, enabling different
versions of opinions on the

237
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,466
platform, very important.

238
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:45,938
But it is imperative

239
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,574
to not allow different

240
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,915
versions of facts.

241
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:58,483
Disinformation topples
governments, it kills companies,

242
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:05,237
it causes wars, it heats
up hate until it boils over.

243
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,323
And it can destroy the
very fabric of humanity.

244
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:11,843
Let me clear some things up.

245
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:16,579
Contrary to what several
social media posts have claimed,

246
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:21,265
President Zelenskyy has
not surrendered to Russia.

247
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:27,950
And when Maverick says "Don't
think, just do,” it is the real

248
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,140
Tom Cruise speaking,

249
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,150
not his Deep Fake

250
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:35,855
Doppelganger TikTok Tom.

251
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,596
And Kanye West, or whatever his
new name is, is not giving out

252
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,939
free Bitcoin or any
other crypto for that matter.

253
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,486
Ah, I so miss those days when

254
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,575
crypto used to mean
plain old cryptography.

255
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:58,368
But I digress.

256
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,978
So, how do we
fight disinformation?

257
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,181
Well, there is now active and
amazing research in this field.

258
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,538
Algorithms are being built

259
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:10,887
to blunt the
weaponization of information.

260
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:15,933
They analyze things like
timing, frequency, tone

261
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,767
coherence, and they
triangulate information

262
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,600
against verifiable sources.

263
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:26,609
But even as these algorithms are
developed, common sense, ladies

264
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:31,320
and gentlemen, remains the most
powerful – most powerful weapon,

265
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:34,124
I should say,
against disinformation.

266
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,556
And one more thing.

267
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:42,689
The best way to authenticate
content is to authenticate the

268
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,971
creator of it.

269
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:47,374
The brightest signal regarding
if a piece of information is

270
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,478
true or not is the
source of the information.

271
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:57,492
Who created it and what is
the reputation of the creator?

272
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:00,301
Identity to the rescue again.

273
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,233
The veracity of information
is the absolute imperative

274
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,209
in cyber security.

275
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,357
All right.

276
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,684
Third insight: Ditch our dogmas.

277
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:16,346
Disruptions debunk
dogma and legacy thinking.

278
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,551
Sacred beliefs suddenly get
upended and we somehow put up

279
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:24,283
with things we never
thought acceptable.

280
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:28,457
We don't bat an eye at not being
able to carry a bottle of wine

281
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,158
in our carryon luggage.

282
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:37,315
After spending decades obsessing
over privacy, we somehow get

283
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,672
comfortable with sharing our
most intimate medical data and

284
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,282
allowing contact tracing.

285
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,392
We give up our entitlements
and our conveniences

286
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:51,155
for the right reasons.

287
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:56,231
But it took a 9/11 and a
pandemic for us to accept

288
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:57,942
those reasons.

289
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,594
In cybersecurity, we
have faced this tradeoff

290
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,879
between security
and convenience.

291
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:10,545
And dogma tells us to prioritize
convenience over security.

292
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:15,197
Maybe what a cyber disruption
tells us is that we should

293
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:18,918
always prioritize
security over convenience.

294
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,760
Look, I'm not saying
convenience is not important.

295
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,273
It absolutely is.

296
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:31,483
What I am saying is that we need
to stop sacrificing security at

297
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,259
the altar of convenience.

298
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,278
The level of digitalization
of our world has crossed that

299
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,766
threshold where the risk of
doing so outweighs the rewards.

300
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:51,299
The gluttony of convenience
sometimes obscures our ability

301
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,801
to see its
unintended consequences.

302
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:59,274
We live in the time of the
fourth industrial revolution.

303
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,395
There are massive
technological forces at play

304
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:07,236
pervasive connectivity,
artificial intelligence,

305
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:10,395
decentralized edge computing.

306
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:16,815
For the first time perhaps, the
rate of change of technology is

307
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:21,288
outpacing the human
capacity to adapt and

308
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,815
consume it responsibly.

309
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,789
The regulator and the
innovator both have to help.

310
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,856
And governments are
certainly taking note.

311
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,789
The regulator is working
to ensure that we don't

312
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,372
get ahead of our skis.

313
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:43,276
The SEC recently made moves
to demand responsible disclosure

314
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:45,650
and board
governance of cybersecurity.

315
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,062
The executive order here
in the US, Australian Critical

316
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:54,637
Infrastructure Uplift Program,
France's Cyber Alert System,

317
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:59,120
UK's Bug Bounty, very,
very notable moves in 2021.

318
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,456
But the most important
role is that of the innovator.

319
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,470
Let's take an example.

320
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,550
An electric car.

321
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,265
These days, we don't think twice
about spending thirty minutes

322
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,572
to charge our electric vehicle

323
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:17,319
on a drive from
LA to San Francisco.

324
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,590
Why is that?

325
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:26,156
Well, we accept thirty minutes
at the charger versus five

326
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,370
minutes at the pump

327
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,372
not just because we
care about the climate.

328
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:36,468
Instead, the innovator grows the
pie and delivers new benefits.

329
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:38,297
Autonomous driving.

330
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,109
Personalized, accurate
insurance premiums.

331
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,986
And my personal
favorite, dog mode.

332
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,554
The car detects that 
there is a pet in the car

333
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,421
and turns on climate control.

334
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,736
Innovation.

335
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:56,687
Similarly, in cybersecurity,
we need to reframe our goal as

336
00:21:56,688 --> 00:22:00,600
security and
convenience and innovation.

337
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:04,014
These could be personalized
cyber insurance premiums,

338
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:06,450
privacy, perhaps something else.

339
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:10,553
Let's grow the pie rather
than debating how to cut it.

340
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:17,679
We need to ditch the dogma
of security or convenience.

341
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,286
All right.

342
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:23,343
So, friends, let's
bring it all together.

343
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:24,745
Let's bring it home.

344
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:28,525
Let's review the three ideas we
explored with our time together.

345
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:34,146
First, identity is the one
constant in the everchanging

346
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,848
world of cybersecurity.

347
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:40,240
Second, what
matters most and what we

348
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:44,404
protect is the truth, the
veracity of information.

349
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:48,191
Finally, we need to stop
believing that the security

350
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,039
versus convenience
is a zero-sum tradeoff.

351
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:58,243
A crisis is a
terrible thing to waste.

352
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:02,080
Look, I don't know if these
three ideas are the perfect

353
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,878
lessons to learn
from a cyber crisis.

354
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,765
But do we need to live through
one in order to not waste it?

355
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,568
I ask you, are we 
really going to wait

356
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:16,644
for a cyber pandemic 
to transform security?

357
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:21,681
Though a cyber crisis may
not cost as many human lives, it

358
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,884
would spread much
faster, at the speed of light

359
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:25,815
versus the speed of humans.

360
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:29,254
It could have a massive
and debilitating societal and

361
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:33,214
economic impact as it takes
out critical infrastructure.

362
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:39,726
When our physical world got
disrupted, we went online to

363
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:42,160
remain productive
and remain connected.

364
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:46,741
If our digital world is
disrupted, where would we go?

365
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,019
What would we do?

366
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:55,062
Transforming security will
require us to reorient our

367
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:59,391
thinking from being
infrastructure centric to

368
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,271
identity centric and
information centric.

369
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:09,405
It will require us to be mindful
enough to care deeply about

370
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:16,291
constants, astute enough
to identify and focus on the

371
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:21,129
imperatives, and brave
enough to ditch our dogmas.

372
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:25,941
Transform we must,
reluctantly or otherwise.

373
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:28,654
Our survival depends on it.

374
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:33,831
Let's be authors
and not just readers.

375
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,173
This is our story.

376
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,819
Let's not allow
anyone else to write it.

377
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,284
Thank you.
