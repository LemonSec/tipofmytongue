1
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,239
>> ANNOUNCER: Please welcome 
Executive Vice President

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,742
and General Manager
Security and Collaboration,

3
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:19,157
Cisco, Jeetu Patel.

4
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,843
>> JEETU PATEL: Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,982
Isn't it great to be
in a live audience?

6
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:32,604
Yeah.

7
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:36,741
You know, a little
trivia about Rohit.

8
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,067
So, Rohit and I used to work
together and when I had my

9
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,971
daughter, he was the first
coworker – I used to live in

10
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:48,072
Chicago at the time and we were
working in California so I was

11
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:51,744
going back and forth – and when
I was on paternity leave, he was

12
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,063
the first coworker that came
out there to see my daughter.

13
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,827
So, it’s so nice to
share a stage with him.

14
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:56,894
I know.

15
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,574
Look at that.

16
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:04,745
So, you know, it's great to be
in person but I used to have a

17
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,223
superpower and I
have kind of lost it.

18
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,710
I used to have a superpower
which was seven minutes flat, I

19
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:12,376
could pack my bags to
go for a weeklong trip.

20
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,933
I don't know if any of you folks
feel this, but I’m feeling it

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,056
right now because yesterday it
took me about seventy minutes of

22
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:22,235
staring at my suitcase and I
still forgot a bunch of things.

23
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:28,432
My entire product line for
my hair was like – I left it at

24
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,260
home, so it took me
a while to get ready.

25
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:34,042
So, if – today if you feel like
I'm a little disheveled, it is

26
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,565
because I left my hair
line products at home.

27
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:42,358
I'm feeling a 
little disrespected here.

28
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,923
That wasn't a joke.

29
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,417
That was the truth.

30
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:48,648
Anyway, it’s good to be here.

31
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:52,222
And you know, if you take
away the jokes though and just

32
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:56,253
actually take – rewind back a
few years and what it was like

33
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,576
and just booking travel.

34
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,173
And the amount of
work that you have to do.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,486
You have to make multiple calls.

36
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,166
You would have to go
on multiple websites.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,688
You would have to go to multiple
companies and deal with making

38
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,298
sure that you get
your hotel done right.

39
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,296
You went to your
car rental place.

40
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,440
You also got your, you
know, kind of flights booked.

41
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,255
Today, you don't
have that issue.

42
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:18,544
Today, you actually go to a
single site and you have got

43
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,303
this fluidity of exchange of
data and everything is pretty

44
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,472
interconnected and you’re
able to go out, in a matter of

45
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:27,475
minutes, just go 
out and get your,

46
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,498
you know, reservations booked.

47
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,626
And this kind of
interconnectedness is

48
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,872
something that most of us
have learned to expect in our

49
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:42,116
day to day life, whether it be
within your personal situation

50
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,257
or at work.

51
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,626
And what you are starting to see
is that there is a tremendous

52
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:49,040
amount of benefit of having this
interconnectedness, but what

53
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,475
you also see is there is a fair
amount of security challenges

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,197
that come along with it.

55
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:57,151
And so, if you look at, you
know, malware or phishing

56
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,635
attacks or ransomware, these
are growing at double and triple

57
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:03,519
digit kind of, you know,
rates as you move forward.

58
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:09,305
And this interconnectedness
itself is actually – it’s not

59
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:12,998
just something that’s impacting
you but every single member of

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,496
the supply chain,
your customers, your

61
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,006
suppliers, your partners.

62
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,801
When there is something
that happens to them,

63
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,611
it impacts you, right?

64
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:22,918
And so, there is this kind of
ecosystem that we are living in

65
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,281
right now, and in this
interconnected world, there is a

66
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:29,649
simple but massively overlooked
problem that I want to spend

67
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,546
this session talking about.

68
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:35,266
But before we do that, what I
wanted to do was make sure that

69
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:40,067
we talk about three specific
trends that our 300,000

70
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,521
customers are
actually sharing with us.

71
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,761
And by the way, this is going to
be kind of a stacking of trends.

72
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,194
So, Rohit went
through three trends.

73
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,476
I am going to go
through three trends.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,944
I’m sure there’s the next
person that’s going to come

75
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,161
that’s going to go through
three trends and you can then

76
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,668
stack, rank us, and
tell us which one is better.

77
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,062
But the reality is that there
is a key set of trends that we

78
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:02,952
actually have that are – that
are becoming challenges in the

79
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:06,554
industry that we really have
to think about collectively as a

80
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,280
society rather
than individually.

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,677
So, let’s talk
about the first trend.

82
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:14,587
The first trend is the fact that
we as businesses are competing

83
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,966
as holistic ecosystems,
not as individual

84
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,495
organizations by ourselves.

85
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:25,679
What that means is that you
yourself might be materially

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,633
impacted in the way that your
production line works, in the

87
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,748
way that your supply chain
works, in the way in which your

88
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:36,461
demand cycle works based on what
happens to the other members

89
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:37,694
in the ecosystem.

90
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,215
Now, what you’re starting to see
over here, and a great example

91
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,645
of this is a top auto maker
recently, they had to stop their

92
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:49,688
entire production line because
one small component parts

93
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,918
manufacturer was not able to,
you know, protect themselves

94
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,311
because they had a
potential security breach.

95
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,856
And so, you had to have the
entire production line stopped.

96
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:06,542
Now, what specifically are
companies doing about this is

97
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,831
they are starting to take a much
more measured approach around

98
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:13,156
risk and making sure that they
can assess risk and say, well,

99
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:16,087
you know, if I'm going to have
vulnerabilities, the reality is,

100
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,001
is you have newer and newer
vulnerabilities that keep coming

101
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,246
up every single day.

102
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,206
But of the known vulnerabilities
– here’s a statistic that’s

103
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:25,332
fascinating – of the known
vulnerabilities that an

104
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:31,024
organization knows, only 20% of
them actually get remediated and

105
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,033
patched and fixed.

106
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,510
Only 20%.

107
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,558
Think about that.

108
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,309
And so, what we need to do is
make sure that we take a much

109
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,973
more risk-based approach
to vulnerability management.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,052
That is what’s happening
and it’s what more and more

111
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:43,735
companies are doing.

112
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,661
And they’re starting to make
sure that they take a more

113
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:49,915
informed decision based on which
specific vulnerabilities do I

114
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:52,533
need to patch based on the
highest amount of risk rather

115
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:55,646
than first in, first out so
that I can make sure I have a

116
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,953
better security posture.

117
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:58,476
So, that's the first trend.

118
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:04,114
And associated and tied very
closely to that first trend is

119
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,820
the second trend, which
is everyone is an insider.

120
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,567
And what I mean by everyone
is an insider is firstly, humans

121
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,178
are pretty easy targets to
go after for cyber criminals.

122
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,712
And attacks are becoming much
more bespoke and personalized.

123
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,368
They are going after Jeetu
Patel rather than going after

124
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,895
the entirety of the
population that you might have.

125
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,661
And so, they are getting much
more personalized and more and

126
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:28,962
more of these individual
targets, whether they be, you

127
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:31,363
know, employees, but you don’t
just have employees anymore.

128
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,003
You have employees
and contractors.

129
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,065
But you have suppliers
and customers and partners.

130
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:39,212
So, the amount of people
that can go out and impact your

131
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,686
security posture is getting
larger and larger and larger.

132
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,806
And so, everyone is an insider.

133
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:45,586
You are starting to see that.

134
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:48,526
But specifically what is
starting to happen, and here is

135
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:54,390
another interesting statistic,
is 56% of the breaches that

136
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:58,796
happen, happen because of an
unknowing employee negligence

137
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:02,711
act rather than something that
is actually malicious in intent.

138
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,300
56%.

139
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:10,005
Now, if you really start
thinking about this and go, no

140
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:12,773
one's going to be working to
plan to be negligent when they

141
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:13,440
come into the office.

142
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,626
No one says, hey, I'm coming
into the office and I'm going to

143
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:16,796
be negligent today.

144
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,325
Right?

145
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,391
But mistakes happen.

146
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:21,782
And the reason for that is
because the friction is too high

147
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,974
and because of the
friction being high, the

148
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,095
efficacy goes down.

149
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,735
And so, you have to make
sure that those get balanced.

150
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:31,787
In fact, an example over here is
the Metropolitan Police, there

151
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:34,761
was an employee that
accidentally deleted 87 million

152
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:39,546
– 8.7 million records and
slowed down prosecutions that

153
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,398
impacted 17,000 cases.

154
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,127
Just out of pure
negligence, right?

155
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,381
And so, when you start thinking
about these pieces, the way that

156
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,424
we are actually going out
and attacking these problems is

157
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,305
through zero trust.

158
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,212
We’re saying, well, let’s make
sure that we actually have the

159
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:55,221
least privileged access that
we can provide to people, and so

160
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,183
there is a zero trust
mechanism that is in place.

161
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,975
And customers continually are
needing to assess behavior and

162
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:07,078
grant continuous assessment of
risk and then grant trust rather

163
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,519
than making sure that that only
happens at the time of log in.

164
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:12,386
So, what you are now starting
to see happen is rather than

165
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,959
saying I'm only going to verify
whether you are who you say you

166
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,827
are and give you access at
the time of login, I'm going to

167
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,022
assess your behavior
on a regular basis.

168
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,936
And if you are doing something
that’s anomalous in nature, even

169
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,917
though you might have logged
in, even though you have access,

170
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,631
I'm going to make
sure I can intercept.

171
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:32,048
And so, that's what’s
happening from a, you know,

172
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,712
zero trust standpoint.

173
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:38,453
And the third major trend that
you are seeing is something that

174
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:40,758
we have all have lived over
the course of the past couple of

175
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:43,322
years and it is
around hybrid work.

176
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,861
People are going to
work in mixed mode.

177
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,502
Sometimes they are
going to work in the office.

178
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,070
Sometimes they are
going to work at home.

179
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,134
Sometimes they are going
to be somewhere in between.

180
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,688
And when you actually see this
mixed mode of working, what is

181
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:58,156
going to happen is you are
going to be accessing data and

182
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:02,039
systems from any device, whether
it be managed or unmanaged.

183
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,591
You are going to be accessing
applications that are either

184
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,008
sanctioned or unsanctioned.

185
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,565
And you are going to be
accessing them from

186
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:10,684
networks, whether either
secured or unsecured.

187
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:14,265
And you need to make sure that
while you are accessing that,

188
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,954
what do we specifically need to
do so that we can make sure that

189
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,369
the risk of breach is low, the
risk of intellectual property

190
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,371
theft is low?

191
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:26,782
And this puts a lot of
pressure on the SecOps team.

192
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,820
It puts a lot of pressure
on the NetOps team.

193
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:30,873
Right?

194
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,388
And so, specifically,
what are we doing to go

195
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,593
out and address this trend?

196
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:38,299
And what’s starting to happen
is rather than point solutions,

197
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,880
you are starting to see
integrated architectures take

198
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,855
more and more
prominence in this market.

199
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,442
When I talk about innovative
architectures, I'm talking about

200
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:51,562
networking and security coming
together rather than being

201
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:55,682
specifically separate
islands by themselves.

202
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,904
And to simplify management,
we need to make sure that the

203
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:02,257
management is simplified not
just for the SecOps person but

204
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,564
also the NetOps person, and
ideally do it in a way that’s

205
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:07,820
fluid, and also make sure that
user has the lowest amount of

206
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:11,013
friction, because what you have
now started seeing is what Rohit

207
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:13,215
was talking about, you
don't have to tradeoff

208
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:14,432
security for convenience.

209
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,427
What you’re starting
to see happen is when

210
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:19,591
the friction does down, your
efficacy automatically goes up.

211
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,942
So, you’re starting to see
this integrated architecture

212
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:24,544
come into place.

213
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,739
Those are the three major
trends that we’re seeing in our

214
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,147
customer base, which 
is businesses are

215
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:30,589
competing as ecosystems.

216
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,013
Everyone is behaving
like an insider.

217
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:37,280
And hybrid work is here to stay
and is actually causing far more

218
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,433
challenge in how you can
secure an organization with a

219
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,810
tremendous amount of pressure.

220
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:46,316
So, what do we start to do
about this entire area and

221
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,586
what is the big challenge that 
we are starting to see have

222
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,987
happen that I 
talked about earlier?

223
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,581
Well, the big challenge we
see is that we need security

224
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,665
resilience just like you need
business resilience and just

225
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,119
like you need
operational resilience.

226
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,018
There is a need for
security resilience.

227
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,007
Because there is a
massive ripple effect.

228
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:08,653
And the weakest link in your
supply chain can bring down the

229
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,353
entirety of your
entire ecosystem.

230
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,138
So, what is happening today?

231
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:20,090
Well, we have this construct
that Wendy Nather, who, by the

232
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,864
way, gave a great – she
was participating in the

233
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,308
rap music earlier on.

234
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,653
She’s right there.

235
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:29,585
She is the Head of
Cisco's Advisory CISOs.

236
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:33,813
And she coined this term called
the security poverty line.

237
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,363
What does the security
poverty line mean?

238
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:41,055
It means that there’s a baseline
level of minimum security

239
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,509
posture that every
company should maintain.

240
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,734
And when companies don't have
the right level of resource or

241
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:50,545
knowhow to go out and
maintain that, that’s when

242
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:52,843
they fall below the
security poverty line.

243
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,221
And what that does is
puts the entirety of the

244
00:11:57,222 --> 00:12:00,208
ecosystem at risk, right?

245
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:04,779
And so, what we want to do
is make sure that when this

246
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,183
happens, you don't ignore the
smaller companies, the not for

247
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:11,396
profit companies that are
participating, because 60% of

248
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,585
small businesses that do have a
cyber-attack actually go out of

249
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,098
business in six months.

250
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,636
And so, if you are below the
security poverty line and you

251
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:23,347
are actually participating in
an ecosystem, not only are you

252
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:25,913
going out and putting
yourself at risk, but the entire

253
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:27,098
ecosystem is at risk.

254
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,828
Now, we collectively
have to make sure that

255
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,767
this problem gets solved.

256
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,577
And so, to talk a little
bit more about that, what I

257
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,661
wanted to have was my partner in
crime, Shailaja Shankar, who is

258
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:45,884
the SVP and GM for the security
business, to come over here and

259
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:48,468
talk about the dimensions of
the security poverty line and

260
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,889
specifically what we need to do
collectively as a group to make

261
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,161
sure that we can go out and
address the issue, because if we

262
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:59,930
don't address the least prepared
in the world, for going out,

263
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:03,335
preventing for themselves,
the most prepared will suffer.

264
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,158
So, with that, let me
make sure that I invite

265
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,346
Shailaja Shankar on stage.

266
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:08,656
Shailaja, come on up.

267
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,020
>> SHAILAJA SHANKAR:
Thank you, Jeetu.

268
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,267
The security
poverty line is real.

269
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,772
It is present.

270
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,910
It's complex.

271
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,797
And it's multidimensional.

272
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,935
When you think about the
security poverty line, there are

273
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:37,768
multiple factors
for us to consider.

274
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,647
Number one, first
and foremost is budget.

275
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:45,522
Organizations that are running
on razor thin margins will be

276
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:48,712
hard pressed to invest
in security the way large

277
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,987
organizations are
able to invest in them.

278
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,077
Then the second
factor is the expertise.

279
00:13:56,181 --> 00:14:01,331
When – even when organizations
are aware that they are at risk,

280
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:10,477
they may not actually be – they
may not actually be – have the

281
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,237
dedicated skills, they may not
have the expertise, they may not

282
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:22,383
have the experience to actually
go attack the problem head on.

283
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,759
And the third aspect
to consider is capability.

284
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:31,383
When you think about a
capability, you are really

285
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:36,451
thinking about knowing what it
is to – knowing what needs to be

286
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,245
done and being able
to actually doing it.

287
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:43,247
It's about the knowing-doing gap
that we are trying to bridge.

288
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:49,960
So, what you will find in this
domain is organizations, while

289
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,858
knowing what needs
to be done, they may be

290
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,456
faced with constraints.

291
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:56,809
So, constraints in
the form of outsourced software

292
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:03,401
or outdated hardware or even
regulatory controls that they

293
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,162
have to address.

294
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:11,014
All of that puts a – puts them
on the back foot in being able

295
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:14,578
to address them in the time
that they need to address.

296
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,178
And finally, influence.

297
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,269
Large organizations are able
to negotiate the right kind of

298
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,992
terms with their vendors,
suppliers, and partners the way

299
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:31,787
the small organizations
are not able to address.

300
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:35,415
So, when you put all this
together, the budgetary

301
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:42,274
constraints, lack of skillset
and expertise, and the

302
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:47,357
capability gaps, as well as
the influence that these small

303
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:52,997
organizations are not able to
overcome, these tend to have

304
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:55,870
far reaching implications.

305
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:02,296
So, let me give you
a specific example.

306
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,929
Think about the
ransomware attack that

307
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,926
we saw with Blackbaud.

308
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,919
Blackbaud is one of the
world’s largest organizations.

309
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:16,025
They deal with education,
administration, fundraising, and

310
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,972
financial management systems.

311
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:23,376
That one ransomware attack on
Blackbaud has impacted over a

312
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:27,358
thousand organizations,
and many of them happened

313
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,009
to be nonprofit organizations.

314
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,709
Think about the
ripple effect of that.

315
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:38,971
When I think about nonprofit
organizations, I actually think

316
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:41,268
of them as 
critical infrastructure.

317
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:45,406
When nonprofit organizations
are not able to attend to the

318
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,419
victims of violence, they are
not able to be there in times of

319
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,121
disaster, and when they are not
able to feed the hungry even,

320
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,094
then we are all impacted.

321
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:02,882
So, I'm not suggesting by
any means that the nonprofit

322
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:06,540
organizations are the
only ones that are below

323
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,283
the security poverty line.

324
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:11,701
You must consider
the critical infrastructure.

325
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:17,141
Again, let me give you
a real world example.

326
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:22,813
Most of the nation's drinking
water and water waste management

327
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,062
systems are municipality owned.

328
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,991
So, think about the margins
under which those businesses are

329
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:35,442
running, what – their
operating revenues are

330
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:37,375
really very, very low.

331
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:41,463
And it is really hard for
them to invest what is needed

332
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,270
to invest in cybersecurity.

333
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,742
And compound that with
what happened with another

334
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,380
real life example.

335
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,718
The Department of
Justice recently indicted a

336
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,466
former employee of a rural
water management authority.

337
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:01,999
And that former employee was
allegedly – or he was accused –

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,711
or allegedly – allegedly
accessing or attempting to

339
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,716
access the computer to
tamper with the disinfectant

340
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,393
levels of the water.

341
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:18,166
So, think about how the digital
world is connected to the real

342
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:24,202
world and how a lack of
knowledge, lack of capability,

343
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,982
lack of expertise, lack
of budget impacts not just

344
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,941
businesses but also
impacts societies at large.

345
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,677
So, we must stand together.

346
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,529
Jeetu alluded to it earlier.

347
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:43,246
Let me quote a
Native American proverb.

348
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:47,369
"We do not inherit the
Earth from our ancestors;

349
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,694
we borrow it from our children."

350
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,832
We must think of the future.

351
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,469
We have to work together.

352
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:57,452
This interconnected problem
requires an interconnected

353
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:59,398
approach to solving it.

354
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,507
Shared risk calls
for shared defenses.

355
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,244
As an industry, we
owe it to each other.

356
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:10,894
I feel it’s our civic
duty to do this.

357
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:17,625
For the past thirty years, Cisco
has been at the forefront of

358
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,437
connecting people and data.

359
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:23,219
And Cisco is committed to
making the world a safer place,

360
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:24,970
a more secure place.

361
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,193
Here are just a few things
that we are doing to attack this

362
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:32,274
problem – to
address this problem.

363
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,855
We are helping
in times of crisis.

364
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,744
We have partnered
with thirty-plus critical

365
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:47,098
infrastructure organizations and
running security products 24/7

366
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,035
supporting critical
customers in Ukraine.

367
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:57,218
This is us lending our expertise
to – to an area where the

368
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,998
expertise is needed the most.

369
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,146
We are sharing intelligence.

370
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,488
As a founding member of
the Cyber Threat Alliance, we

371
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,890
partner with
more than thirty-three

372
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,555
global security vendors.

373
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,516
We share our intelligence.

374
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,359
The focus here is to make
sure that customers of all these

375
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,293
companies are protected
while we are also defending

376
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:24,032
the digital ecosystem.

377
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:30,931
Next, we are helping to bolster
the critical infrastructure.

378
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:35,109
Here let me give you
another real world example.

379
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,685
We recently partnered with
another county water authority

380
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:43,151
in the rural part of the
United States with the goal of

381
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:47,561
automating the monitoring of the
utilities industrial network.

382
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,522
There, while at the same time,
we are also helping them reduce

383
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:55,121
the water loss in a
water scarce environment.

384
00:20:55,687 --> 00:21:01,546
That is helping the critical
infrastructure with the – with

385
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:03,315
the help that they needed.

386
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,741
Now, we are taking
it a step further.

387
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,453
We have recently announced
a five year, $15 million

388
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,297
partnership with NetHope.

389
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:18,384
We are strengthening their
efforts in cybersecurity in the

390
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,257
non-governmental agencies.

391
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,526
We are also doubling down
our security product charitable

392
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:28,620
grants going to
the nonprofit sector.

393
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,071
For the first time in this
program, we are also including

394
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:33,171
our cloud products.

395
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,393
We are including
secure access by Duo.

396
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:39,191
We’re including Secure
Endpoint, and also our Umbrella

397
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:41,050
Cloud Security products.

398
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:49,961
The challenges facing the
organizations that are below the

399
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:54,360
security poverty line
are so large that no single

400
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,786
organization can
actually address.

401
00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,042
I welcome you
all to work with us.

402
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:05,194
I welcome you all to join us in
making sure that we do the right

403
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:07,167
thing for this
interconnected world.

404
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:11,194
Join us in contributing
what is needed to help these

405
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:16,025
organizations get prepared and
help them respond in times of

406
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:18,760
crisis or in case of a breach.

407
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:22,889
I say it again because we 
do this because we owe it

408
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,935
to each other.

409
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:26,912
We do it because
it is our civic duty.

410
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,170
Together, we
can do great things.

411
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:32,472
Together, we can make the world
a better place, we can make the

412
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:35,553
world a safer place, and we
can most certainly make the

413
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,104
world a secure place.

414
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,849
>> JEETU PATEL: And folks,
we are in a hyper competitive

415
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,958
industry right now.

416
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,006
I think there is a
bunch of vendors

417
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,348
in the space, in this room.

418
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,364
There’s a bunch of
customers that are in this room.

419
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:49,894
And when we talk about
competing with one another,

420
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:52,698
competition is good
because it makes us all better.

421
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,918
But the real
competition isn't each other.

422
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,873
The real competition
are the bad actors.

423
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,210
And let's make sure
that we can all join forces.

424
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,433
I think there has to be a
business model shift to make

425
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,551
sure that people below the
security poverty line are also

426
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:07,062
kept secure so that the
entire ecosystem is safe.

427
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:10,168
Collectively, we think we
can defeat our adversaries.

428
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,621
We’re going to do
our part at Cisco.

429
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,668
We are looking forward to
partnering with everyone.

430
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:17,371
And thank you all for taking
the time to come attend this.

431
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,803
And make sure you go take
a look at our booth as well.

432
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:21,973
And Shailaja Shankar,
ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:23:21,974 --> 00:23:23,734
>> SHAILAJA SHANKAR: 
Thank you.
