1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,823
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,870
- [Host] Our next contestant,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,870
the starting point for all
your security activities,

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,830
please welcome Co-Founder and CEO

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,270
of Sevco Security, J.J Guy.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,686
(upbeat music, applause)

7
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:28,590
- [Host] Okay?

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:29,424
- [J.J. Guy] Very welcome.

9
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:30,256
- [Host] Thank you.

10
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:31,357
- Wow. You brought a fan club with you.

11
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,865
(J.J. laughs)

12
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,310
- Okay, J.J., your time begins right now.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,310
- Thank you.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,080
An accurate asset inventory
has been control number one

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,830
in all of our security
programs for decades.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,269
Yet, despite all those audit attestations,

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,600
none of us have any idea
how many devices we own.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
My name is J.J. Guy.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,970
I'm the CEO of Sevco and
we are here to fix it.

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,170
Now, listen, this is not a new problem.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,060
Vendors have been bolting on solutions

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,520
to existing technologies for
decades to try to solve this.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,930
The challenge is each one of them

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,520
gives you a different answer.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,539
None of them are wrong, but
they are a different subset

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,610
of the whole.

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,750
In order to get a
complete asset inventory,

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,970
you've got to stitch together

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,570
all those different
technologies into a single view.

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,690
At Sevco, we connect your existing sources

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,730
of inventory via APIs.

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,680
We send those through a correlation engine

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,834
to understand the single view of devices

34
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,350
across all those different
inventories and give

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,009
you your first ever complete inventory.

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,240
This is the first thing I
want you all to hear very,

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
very clearly.

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,309
If you are not aggregating
inventory for multiple sources,

39
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,762
you do not have a complete inventory.

40
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:46,260
But aggregation is just the start.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,670
Because every one of those inventories

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,920
represents a snapshot in time.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,860
But nothing about device
inventory is static.

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,150
Employees these days
are in constant motion.

45
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,770
They get hired, they get fired.

46
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,810
They're working from the office.

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,643
They're working from home.

48
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:00,720
These days, they're
working from the beach.

49
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,210
None of those snapshots recognize

50
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,600
or represent device change.

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,259
I was part of the founding
team of carbon black.

52
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,090
We invented EDR.

53
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,040
We revolutionized incident response

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,350
inside the enterprise by
using endpoint telemetry

55
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,650
instead of snapshots of disk or memory.

56
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,760
At Sevco, we are doing the same thing

57
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
for your asset inventories.

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,870
We built a real time
streaming cloud platform

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,890
that's constantly correlating inventory

60
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,250
from all your different sources,

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,340
but we're also producing asset telemetry,

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,090
that captures all of
those changes over time.

63
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,050
This is the second thing I
want you to hear very clearly.

64
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,230
If you want to advance
your operational discipline

65
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,769
inside your organizations,
you must recognize

66
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,840
that nothing about device
inventory is static.

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,590
Finally, remember how we opened.

68
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,550
Asset inventory has been the start of our

69
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,380
information security
programs for a reason,

70
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,061
most other activities
inside IT rely on it.

71
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,050
Listen, I'll be straight, you all.

72
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,710
When you deploy us, we are
gonna surface problems.

73
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,450
You have existing people and processes

74
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,320
inside your organization
to fix those problems,

75
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,459
then they are failing.

76
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,660
They're not failing because those people

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,570
in processes are bad.

78
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,459
They are failing because
they're working off bad data.

79
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,680
You get them good data and
they will get better results

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,930
with little to no change
in how they do business.

81
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,300
Fixing the problem is a one x return.

82
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,633
Fixing the system? That's a 10 x return.

83
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,779
So third thing I want
you to hear very clearly.

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,493
Yeah, they fix the system.

85
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,410
That's Sevco.

86
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,230
We're "been there, done that" team.

87
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,600
Yeah. We're on a mission to fix it.

88
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,757
Thanks, you all.

89
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,920
(applause)

90
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,125
- [Host] Wow. J.J.!

91
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:46,160
Never have I heard a
more impassioned speech

92
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,430
on asset inventory, man.

93
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,263
(J.J. laughs)

94
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,320
Amazing. Amazing.

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,170
- [Host] You're very
concerned about the device

96
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,100
on the beach,

97
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,933
which is good.

98
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,991
Yeah, it's good.

99
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:56,574
(upbeat music)
