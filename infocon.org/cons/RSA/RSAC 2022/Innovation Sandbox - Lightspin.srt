1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:02,706
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,820
- Our next company:

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,170
graph-based cloud security

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,270
built by and for cloud engineers.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,270
Please welcome CEO of
Lightspin, Vladi Sandler.

6
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,683
(applause)

7
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:27,187
(funky music)

8
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:28,406
- How are you?
- Great.

9
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,336
- Good.
- Thank you very much.

10
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:30,849
- Thanks for being here.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,680
All right, Vladi.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,034
Your time begins now.

13
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,839
- Cloud security engineers are tired.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,130
I know because I was one.

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,890
We are tired of meaningless
alerts in the ten of thousands,

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,340
tired of duct tape tools
overpromising their value,

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
tired of getting blame for breaches.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,950
And the problem is only getting worse.

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,900
It's too complicated with the multi-cloud

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,769
and the various flavors
of Kubernetes, the lack

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,370
of knowledge and the expertise
in the all of the above.

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,710
It's impossible to hire
talent to address it all.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,360
So how do you solve it?

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,110
Lightspin's approach is
a cloud security platform

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,960
built on graph theory,

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,649
our proprietary algorithm
mapping the topology

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,320
and the attack surface
for your cloud environment

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,380
because it's impossible to get
your arms around the problem

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,009
without the context given
to you from the graph.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,130
And I guess you want to
know how does it work?

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,920
So our acyclic solution is easy for deploy

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,120
and quickly prioritize
the exploitable risks

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,090
via graph technology,
the connecting the dots

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,100
of risky routes, CVEs, malware,

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,570
and provided those with simple remediation

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,910
via the infrastructure of the code.

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, there is not the time

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
in the presentation where I
make top claims of AI voodoo.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,470
Actually, it's all about research.

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,410
The brain of Lightspin

41
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,619
is our cloud security researchers team

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,700
focusing on the exploitable
risks and collaborating closely

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,400
with our algorithm team to
create the attack paths unique

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,620
to the customer's environment.

45
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,139
So let me show you how
we make engineers' life

46
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,450
1000 time easier.

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,010
Step number one, the attack paths.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,890
Proud to share that attack paths reduce

49
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,890
more than 94.6% of the alert
noises for the engineers.

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,299
Step number two, root code analysis.

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,770
Technology finding one issue
to fix 15 to 20 alerts.

52
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,830
And of course, remediation.

53
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,060
Dynamic remediation
providing a tailor made

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,730
infrastructure of the
code for quick deployment.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,799
In just over a year of
being in the market,

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,660
we have more than 100 tenant
connected to our platform.

57
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,200
Our team including leaders from GE,

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,079
HackerOne, Salesforce, and Amazon.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,520
We're proud to be 50% representation

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,200
of women in the team, including R&D.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,839
And we have raised $20 million

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,570
from Dell Capital and Ibex.

63
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,366
Thank you very much.

64
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,751
- (applause)
- Wow.

65
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,500
30 seconds, man.

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,730
- Yeah.

67
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,310
- So tell me about your family, man.

68
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,550
How's everything going this week?

69
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,497
- We have the time.

70
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,035
We can talk about it a little bit.

71
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:18,128
- Yeah. Good, good.

72
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:20,130
Glad we had some time to catch up.

73
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,470
And I do love that picture
of you super depressed,

74
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,000
like, at the beginning,

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,770
and I'm so glad you
invented this solution, man,

76
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,660
to get out of that.

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,365
- We just came to solve our own problems.

78
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,948
(upbeat music)
