00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:02,746
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,039
- Our next company,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,003
complete software supply chain security,

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,300
please welcome CEO and
co-founder of Cycode, Lior Levy.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,883
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,231
Lior, welcome.

7
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,401
Thanks for being here.

8
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:31,234
- Of course, thank you.

9
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:34,463
- All right Lior, your time begins now.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,070
- The number of software
supply chain attacks is going

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,280
and according to Gartner,
they will triple by 2025

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,240
to a point where 45% of
companies will be affected.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,820
What we are seeing is that attackers

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,730
are shifting their priorities away

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,890
from targeting fortified
production applications

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,370
to the DevOps stores and
infrastructure that makes them.

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,769
So why is this happening?

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,150
First, many of the modern
tools used in the SDLC

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,019
are owned and ran by developers

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,260
and security teams lack
the visibility into it.

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,010
Second, the SDLC has many attack vectors

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,820
that can be used to gain a foothold

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,452
and then move laterally
from one phase to the other.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,910
And then third, up
sectoring has been focused

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,770
on finding vulnerabilities in code

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,089
or protecting production applications,

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,683
but not on securing the
CI/CD pipeline itself.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,570
So this is why we built Cycode,

29
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,419
which is a complete software
supply chain security solution

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,620
that provide visibility,
security and integrity

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,700
across your entire software supply chain.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,560
Cycode addresses the many attack vectors

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,470
that can affect the pipeline,
but the power of the solution

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,860
isn't in its individual capabilities,

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,610
it's how these solutions work
together on our platform.

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,460
In the core of Cycode's
platform is the Knowledge Graph,

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,610
which ingests data from
all the DevOps tools

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,950
and infrastructure that
make up the pipeline.

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,380
From there, it analyzes the metadata,

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,839
configurations, security issues, and more

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,053
to break down the silos of the SDLC.

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,970
Cycode takes a multi-faceted approach

43
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,030
into securing your software supply chain.

44
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,870
First, Cycode organizes the chaotic mess

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,199
of tools and data in today's pipelines

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,190
to provide an unparalleled
visibility across the SDLC.

47
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,400
Then, we help centralize
security policy management

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,030
to harden tools against attacks.

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,730
And lastly, we help
ensure pipeline integrity

50
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,221
by verifying where, when
and how software artifacts

51
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,170
are produced and validating
them at each step,

52
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,993
from code to cloud.

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,750
Our full understanding
of each phase of the SDLC

54
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,380
not only enable us to
identify security issues

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,400
in code, third party dependencies

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,490
and Infrastructure-as-Code templates,

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,470
but also to determine
potential deployment paths

58
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,840
and exploitability so real
world issues are blocked

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,740
before reaching production.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,320
Leveraging this shared context

61
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,459
help us to prioritize remediation

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,393
and save valuable developer's time.

63
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,049
Lastly, Cycode streamlines
the remediation process

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,640
of detected issues using a
workflow automation engine

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,329
that can orchestrate third party solution,

66
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,620
modify infrastructure configurations

67
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,610
and assist developers with code fixes

68
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,653
directly in the preexisting workflows.

69
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,890
Cycode is in a $43 billion market

70
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,540
made up of application security, DevSecOps

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,799
and cloud security.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,580
We are backed by top VC firms

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,780
and led by seasoned
cyber security veterans.

74
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,310
In summary, securing
software supply chains

75
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,770
is the biggest unmet need
in cyber security worldwide.

76
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,983
Thank you.

77
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,810
(audience applauding)

78
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,569
- Fantastic. All right.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,152
