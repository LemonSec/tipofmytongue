- All right, our next contestant.

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,590
Reinventing API security
by bringing XDR techniques

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,010
and true behavioral analytics,

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,223
please welcome CEO and Founder of Neosec.

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,270
Okay, I really don't wanna mispronounce...

7
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,950
Giora?

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,783
Okay.

9
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:39,891
Angle.

10
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:40,751
(audience applauding)

(club music)

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,763
Thank you, Dory.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,039
- Thank you, Dory.

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,140
- Giora.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,470
Thanks a lot, thanks for being here.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,882
Okay, your time begins now.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,640
- APIs power the world's economy today

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,510
by enabling access to
the crown jewels of data.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,710
The security blind spot
of APIs grows larger

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,743
with every new API, but
what is that blind spot?

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,750
Security teams have been focusing on web

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,750
and mobile applications,
and their reliance on APIs,

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,740
but these B2C APIs are only
the tip of the iceberg.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,083
The bigger problem is B2B APIs.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,810
Most security organizations
don't even have

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,220
an inventory of their APIs.

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,720
These B2B APIs are built in-house,

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,050
they're machine to machine,

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,039
and they expose the core
business to the outside.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,700
They're assumed safe because
they're authenticated

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,503
but they're largely unprotected.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,470
B2B APIs are the building
blocks of digital transformation

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,320
and they grow fast in every industry.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,690
Healthcare, payment services,
FinTech, everybody's writing

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,103
more and more of these APIs.

36
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,149
We see today three main API problems.

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,940
First, shadow APIs.

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,280
Those are the APIs that
are not well documented.

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,720
You can't protect what you don't see.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,870
Second, vulnerable or
badly written APIs are

41
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,463
abused and exploited.

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,899
But the bigger problem is API abuse

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,530
because even perfectly
written APIs can be abused

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,530
by an attacker using stolen credentials.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
Using our experience
from founding Light Cyber

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,140
inventing NDR, and then
after getting acquired

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,750
by parallel to networks inventing XDR, we

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,410
at Neosec bring the XDR approach

49
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,162
to solve the API security problem.

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,829
Just like the import market before XDR,

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,270
application security
today relies on signatures

52
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,803
and on inline inspection
of single requests.

53
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,329
In order to solve for
today's attacks, we need

54
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,883
to bring behavior analytics to APIs.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
With our AI-driven 100% SaaS
platform, Neosec created

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
the industry's first API
detection and response.

57
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,769
We first continuously
discover all the APIs

58
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,350
and their posture using
the API activity data.

59
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,370
Using behavior analytics, we
profile the normal behavior

60
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,560
of each user to detect
abnormal behavior accurately

61
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,023
and without using signatures.

62
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,790
We automate response by using

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,810
our direct integration,
as well as open APIs.

64
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,950
And finally, we enable investigation

65
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,156
and threat hunting just like in XDR.

66
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,260
Our platform stores the last
30 days of all API activity

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,980
so we can tell the full
story of API use and abuse,

68
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,040
so your team can make
better security decisions.

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,579
As you can see here, for example,

70
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,150
we have a complete timeline of events

71
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,423
for every API user just like a DVR.

72
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,089
That reach data is essential
both for behavioral analytics,

73
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,473
as well as for investigation
and threat hunting.

74
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,620
Our XDR approach is reinventing

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,490
application security to protect APIs.

76
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,330
We have the team, the
backing, and the customers

77
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,020
to lead this new category.

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,408
Thank you.

79
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,241
(audience clapping)

80
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,074
- Wow.

81
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,273
Man.

82
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,670
You left seven seconds on the table.

83
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,843
It's like a power move.
