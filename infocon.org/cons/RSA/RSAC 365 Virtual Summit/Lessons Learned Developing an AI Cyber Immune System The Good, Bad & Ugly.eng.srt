1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,660
- Hi, I'm Michael Miller,
director of cybersecurity,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,540
R&D from GE Global Research,
on the next 30, 35 minutes,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm gonna take you all on
a journey in developing one

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,919
of the first AI driven
industrial immune systems.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,020
Really highlighting the opportunities

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,080
and challenges, the good, bad, and ugly.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,080
Really lessons learned from
developing a cyber defense

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,560
to secure (indistinct)

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,449
the world's most critical
systems from aviation

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,143
to power grids, weapon
platforms to healthcare.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,019
The concepts, how we got
here, starting with the

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,853
how we got here.

13
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,080
The major evolution of
AI for cybersecurity,

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,000
really has come from advances in storage,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,380
compute, and mathematics.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,680
And while there's a lot of noise

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,610
and kind of misconceptions
that AI cybersecurity

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,110
is gonna replaced the need
for human cyber defenders

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,640
take humans out of the loop.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,490
We've heard the robots are coming

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,080
they're coming for your job.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,980
That couldn't be further from the truth.

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,280
So I also want to kind of demystify AI

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,880
talk about what it's really
good at for this space

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
as well as some of the gaps

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,339
in some of the considerations

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,310
you should have when you go
back to your organization.

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,010
So two of the critical areas there

29
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,500
that all AI cybersecurity
solutions that are

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,570
effective really require
are number one, humans.

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,699
They require deep domain expertise.

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,893
And I like to think of this

33
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:31,530
like you need architects and builders.

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,750
So the architects in this
case are the deep domain

35
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,720
cyber security SMEs, the
subject matter experts.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,080
The builders are your data scientists

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,920
and your mathematician wizards.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,920
So to say without either one of those

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,550
AI cybersecurity solutions
are not very effective.

40
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,420
The other critical ingredient
in this mixture here is data.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,610
The old adage garbage in garbage out

42
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,860
could not be more true
for these solutions.

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,800
So you really need access
to that training data

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,860
and make sure that that data is prepped

45
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:07,867
and prepared to be ingested

46
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,050
by your machine learning algorithms.

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,920
And so with this evolution,
we've seen advancements

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,940
from kind of a first
and second wave of AI,

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,600
moving towards a third wave
of AI, where we're really

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,950
improving our contextual
reasoning, our accuracy.

51
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,850
And with this, we've
seen, major developments

52
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,609
and know improving cyber
threat intelligence.

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,940
We're able to really tackle
some of the challenges

54
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,750
with the scale of the
problem a lot, lot better

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,610
but with all that, it's
still not a panacea.

56
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,110
It's not gonna replace
your cyber defenders.

57
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,360
And in many cases, as we'll discuss

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,270
oftentimes they'll need more humans

59
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,920
in the loop to really do this right?

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,510
So let's start out with
the bad and the ugly.

61
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,250
At least let's talk about the problem

62
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,220
we're trying to solve here.

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,000
Before we get into some of the
good and great, if you will.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,250
I like to use energy
infrastructure as an example

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,750
because all modern organizations
are energy organizations

66
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,750
in the sense that there's not
a single modern organization

67
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,780
that could function without
access to electricity.

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,180
And the last 20 years we've digitized

69
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,050
and networked and automated
our entire energy value chain.

70
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,780
So we can look at energy infrastructure

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,510
or transportation or health or defense.

72
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,350
You're seeing this trend of
the digitization networking

73
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,650
which has woven together
our information technology

74
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,750
and our operational technology
or cyber physical systems.

75
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,110
And through this incredible
tapestry that has

76
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,609
significantly increased the
speed, the size and the volume

77
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,210
of data requirements being
collected, aggregated

78
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,140
and exchanged, and from
a cyber perspective

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,760
that creates a number of challenges.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,170
But the drivers behind
this as pure value creation

81
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,890
it's made our city smart.

82
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,700
It's helped us in the grid space balance

83
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,429
distributed energy
resources to Castic loads.

84
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,500
That maids are it's
makes our transportation

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,020
systems more efficient.

86
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,380
It makes us better at
our health diagnostics

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,050
but with all this, we have
this big, big data problem.

88
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,940
How do we make sense and find patterns

89
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,510
in these data sets again, not
to take humans out of loop

90
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,469
at least with a lot of
the traditional roles

91
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,700
but to make us better at what we do.

92
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,170
A grid, cyber defender, a good one.

93
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,020
If we do this right, AI
can make a good one great.

94
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,159
But it's not again as we'll
see going to take that human

95
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,490
out of the loop.

96
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,460
Again so that's the,
that's the big opportunity.

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,510
The challenge in all, this is,

98
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,580
a number of these IOT or industrial IOT,

99
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,719
especially the legacy systems

100
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,380
were never designed to be
connected to the internet.

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,460
And these are systems that
prioritize functionality

102
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,330
and ease of use, oftentimes, lack

103
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,680
encryption authentication,
communicate in plain text.

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,970
You see a lot of, human
machine interfaces that connect

105
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,670
to these critical systems
that keep trains on the rails

106
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,050
defense platforms accurate and reliable.

107
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,610
You see them have, default passwords.

108
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,230
And so this is the challenge.

109
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,653
It's that there's a scale challenge and,

110
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,530
how do we make sense of it?

111
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,659
How do we detect

112
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,040
and how do we monitor
these large data sets?

113
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
And so AI is really good at
identifying those patterns

114
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,890
and for a lot of things like
spam threat intelligence

115
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,236
identifying those plot, those patterns

116
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:43,640
and these large lights,
data sets is critical.

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,770
The challenge being

118
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,270
is that our adversaries
are also rapidly evolving.

119
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,560
We have, we are dealing
with cyber adversaries.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,430
Whether we look at the solar winds attack

121
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,080
recent solar winds incident,
or the grid, cyber incidents

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,609
or Ukraine and Ukraine, we can try to

123
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,060
and try since we could go on and on

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,840
what we're seeing is we have an adversary

125
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,299
that's complex non-linear
and rapidly evolving.

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,870
And so we need to evolve our
defenses, AI machine learning

127
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,360
and I'll use them interchangeably.

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,420
They are very different.

129
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,910
I understand that, we need
to evolve those defenses

130
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,260
to keep up with that threat

131
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,500
and keep up with the tactics,
techniques, procedures.

132
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,770
And so what we,

133
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,280
for what we developed this
industrial immune system

134
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,130
we studied very closely,
the tactics, techniques

135
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,670
and procedures used by
the adversary to carry

136
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,620
out these attacks and
a couple of interesting

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,810
revelations that really
highlight the limitation

138
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,880
of our current cyber defensives.

139
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,020
On number one we see that an adversary

140
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,919
doesn't always need malware

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,820
or some type of zero day exploit.

142
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,540
Once they get privileged access

143
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,560
to your human machine interface

144
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,300
oftentimes organizations
have no visibility

145
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,680
into those lower layers of
industrial control systems.

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,150
Those critical sensors

147
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,250
and actuators those controllers,
again, that keep trains

148
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,250
on the rails that keep
transportation systems reliable

149
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,370
and safe and efficient
power grids balanced.

150
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,140
Those critical systems oftentimes
we don't have visibility.

151
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,520
We saw and you're praying incidents.

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,900
One thing once they get access

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,573
to that human machine interface,

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,840
no longer do they need malware.

155
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,780
It's the a real legitimate
command using the native protocol

156
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,169
of the system in the wrong
succession or at the wrong time

157
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,660
or both could actually
cause a physical impact.

158
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,620
And so our intrusion
detection systems that work

159
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,360
on a signature heuristic,
or we've seen these ones

160
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,590
and zeros before.

161
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,099
An AI is really good again

162
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,910
at recognizing those patterns

163
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,200
are oftentimes very, very limited.

164
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,539
So what the industrial
immune system we've developed

165
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,800
is focused much more on the physics.

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,910
So we're looking at changes
in voltage and frequency

167
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,810
in ambient temperatures, as
well as the networking layers.

168
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,550
And so we'll get into that a
little bit later, but you see

169
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,060
that the scale of the problem
and why AI applications

170
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,331
in this space are so important.

171
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:19,660
350,000 new pieces of
malware registered each day.

172
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,330
AI again, is very, very good

173
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,210
at recognizing those
signatures and heuristics

174
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,299
and building up our robust
libraries to identify malware.

175
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,890
But when we start asking questions

176
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,189
around contextual reasoning.

177
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,650
Things that humans are really good at.

178
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,610
What was the motivation or
behavior of our adversary?

179
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,950
What were they doing in
that German steel mill

180
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,400
when they're lateraling around

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,620
to different parts of the network

182
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,600
and then something went, boom?

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,870
Did they interrogate one of those systems

184
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,000
in the wrong way that
caused it to go boom?

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Or was that part of their
goal and motivation?

186
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,480
AI is really, really bad at that.

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,010
It's really bad at understanding context.

188
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,500
And that's really what the third wave

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,910
is trying to figure out.

190
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,300
Not patchy attacks,
threatened about a fifth

191
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,479
of the world's shipping
capacity, shut down.

192
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,590
Other critical systems cost
$10 billion worth of damage

193
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,510
was asked to be part of
the expert testimony.

194
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,819
Forensic team just made up
of a very talented group

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,210
of individuals, much
more talented than myself

196
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,570
but that had some clear
signature heuristics

197
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,330
that machine learning AI could
have potentially identified

198
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,170
in an earlier stage.

199
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,829
But what keeps me up at night here

200
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,090
on this slide with all
these big numbers is really

201
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,090
the 2 million cybersecurity
positions on unfilled.

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,740
Again for AI cyber
solutions platforms to work

203
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,550
we need a lot more

204
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,670
we need deep domain
cyber security experts to

205
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,189
fill those roles.

206
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,900
We need more of a diverse,
we need more women.

207
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,939
We need more people

208
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,610
from different diverse backgrounds
joining that workforce.

209
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,980
Because if not, we're
gonna have the same myopia.

210
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,060
A lot of our intrusion detection systems

211
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,930
and firewalls have is
that we're all thinking

212
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,750
through the same set of
prisons and filters, looking

213
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,670
at the challenge when the
adversaries adversary's evolving

214
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,599
in very, very diverse.

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,720
And then we also have to evolve
to the current environment.

216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,900
When the world flipped upside down,

217
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,063
we started these unprecedented
times during the pandemic.

218
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,080
We saw a lot more

219
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,850
most organizations now operating remotely.

220
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,670
So this remote connectivity

221
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,640
if your AI solutions say,
wait, why is this substation?

222
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,540
Why is this train?

223
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,079
Why is this defense platform
now have these remote

224
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,980
VPNs and connections?

225
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,290
That's an anomaly that must be an attack.

226
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,459
You're gonna get
prohibitive false positives

227
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,210
that you can just throw your
AI solution out the door.

228
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,320
'Cause it recognizes patterns based

229
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,510
on a summation of all its perceptions

230
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,010
or previous experience that
have been trained into features.

231
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,100
And that just is not gonna work well.

232
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,800
So we saw with the
pandemic, this huge increase

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,500
in our attack surface and open
publicly vulnerable systems

234
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,880
which is absolutely frightening

235
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,890
because these are critical systems.

236
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,810
And so you see where AI is really good

237
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,900
at identifying those
small changes in malware.

238
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,959
And she used every day.

239
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,190
But not as good as
understanding the behavior

240
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,860
and motivation behind the anomaly.

241
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,980
And I think in all this,

242
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,010
and it's a whole separate presentation

243
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,790
but the current paradigms
that we're using to respond

244
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,349
to these converge it and OT environments

245
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,270
and are very much limited.

246
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,199
Oftentimes we focus too much on technology

247
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,950
and not enough on the people

248
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,560
and process that makes
those solutions holistic.

249
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,459
And so we need to marry human and machines

250
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,850
from an AI perspective

251
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,060
very much so to fill some of these gaps.

252
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,170
So that's, that is the problem.

253
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,209
That's some of the bad and the ugly.

254
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,030
I think some of the good is
also good as recognizing gaps

255
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,630
and recognize some of the
major gaps in this space.

256
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah, absolutely we wanna make

257
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,270
our AI algorithm algos lighter

258
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,990
and more efficient and closer to the edge

259
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,840
and better contextual reasoning.

260
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,170
But to do that, we have
to understand trust.

261
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,079
We have to understand how we can establish

262
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,620
human operator trust.

263
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,100
So that human machine,
human grid, cyber defenders

264
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,590
or human cyber defenders,
they trust the algorithm

265
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,130
and how it's arriving at its conclusion.

266
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,720
And that's part of the big challenge

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,360
and part of the whole area of research

268
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,310
around explainable AI to
develop heightened quality,

269
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,920
interpretable, intuitive human

270
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,810
understandable decisions
with our algorithms.

271
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,959
A great example of that, that
played out and really sad.

272
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,180
One that, that a couple of years ago

273
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,000
a suicidal German pilot
took off the AI autopilot

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,530
with the goal to crash
a commercial airline.

275
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,160
And so that autopilot
would have self-corrected

276
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,110
that nose diving, suicidal
pilot, but the pilot took that

277
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,640
off and, hundreds of
people lost their lives.

278
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,520
And so explainable AI
and that trustworthiness

279
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,020
it actually goes both ways.

280
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,750
It's crazy to think, but
how does that algorithm

281
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,610
actually trust the human
operator, especially

282
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,100
in an area in cybersecurity
in the cyber world

283
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,030
where humans oftentimes
are both the weakest link,

284
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,430
as well as the, the last line of defense.

285
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,170
So there's, there's a huge
area of research there.

286
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,810
And part of that research
is about humble AI

287
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,270
in improving awareness of algorithm.

288
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,819
Think about, imagine a fleet

289
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,920
of autonomous drones
that are about to carry

290
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,579
out a mission in cooperation
with ground troops

291
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,500
they've locked in an on target.

292
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,890
And then all of a sudden they
experience a denial of service

293
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,680
or a jamming attack.

294
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,810
Humble AI, as part of this third wave

295
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,310
or this autonomous
weaponized drones recognize

296
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,599
their limitations, go back
to the human operator and say

297
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,500
I have a lower degree of
confidence in my threshold

298
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,920
of decision-making that I can
accurately hit this target

299
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,520
without any casualties on the ground.

300
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,590
And so that's where we're
going with humble AI.

301
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,040
Some lighter versions of that could be

302
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,430
with diagnostic where an
algorithm is doing a diagnostic

303
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,030
and helping a doctor.

304
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,770
For example, that's good

305
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,069
helping them become great and saying, Hey

306
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm not quite sure what
this you need to check,

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,610
to help validate and verify my findings.

308
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,970
Or a wind turbine generator, right?

309
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,910
Where, we think there's a fault

310
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,670
in this fleet with one
and three, but not two.

311
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,860
I need more data.

312
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,890
Here's my current evidence.

313
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,990
And part of getting there,
part of realizing those goals

314
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,630
of third wave is really,
as Einstein reminded us

315
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,410
as half an answers and
a really good question.

316
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,242
And so as you go back

317
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:53,370
to your organizations and
you assess your own platforms

318
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,860
you need to ask questions like,

319
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,710
how do you establish context?

320
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,610
Interdependently among human machine teams

321
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,410
that are empowered by AI?

322
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,199
How is trust effected when humans

323
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,290
and machines depend on each other?

324
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,660
And how should human machine teams train

325
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,240
with each other really
to improve the state

326
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,300
of the art and answer these questions.

327
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,410
We need to establish a
bi-directional language

328
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,900
of explanation to really improve context

329
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,480
and trust between human and machine teams.

330
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,830
So again, in all of this,
the robots are coming

331
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,010
the robots are here, the AI is here

332
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,240
but it's gonna probably, at least

333
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,240
in the short term require a
lot more human domain experts

334
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,270
than a lot of people give credit.

335
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,740
So what are some of the bad and ugly.

336
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,300
The bad and ugly we see adversaries

337
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,800
are also rapidly evolving their own TTP

338
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,310
to include AI and machine learning.

339
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,260
So one thing that the big thing

340
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,470
that's happening right now is
they're reverse engineering

341
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,290
a lot of the AI systems,

342
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,599
so they can better understand

343
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
what those decision manifolds are.

344
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,940
They can understand that black box nature

345
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,380
this is how the algorithm detected

346
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,970
and localize this specific attack.

347
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,860
Once they understand that
that can pave the way

348
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,150
for poisoning or enabling
them to replicate the system

349
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,819
and manipulate the system

350
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,470
with different adversarial AI attacks.

351
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,480
We're also seeing

352
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,240
and this is a whole separate presentation

353
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,270
but the increasing use

354
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,930
of deep fakes in social
engineering and spear fishing.

355
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,469
We're seeing the use of
AI for behavioral analysis

356
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,390
to find that that weaker link
in the chain, if you will.

357
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,180
We talked about reverse engineering

358
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,660
and then we're also seeing some,

359
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,670
malware 2.0 as these,

360
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,810
polymorphic AI type
attacks that brute force

361
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,880
and just keep attacking until they get

362
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,430
around those signature
juristics in your firewall.

363
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,800
That is something that has
been happening for a while now.

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,319
And we've all seen these, the results

365
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,170
the impact of some of these issues.

366
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,002
And now they're out

367
00:16:57,003 --> 00:17:00,530
and they're not always malicious
adversarial, cyber attacks.

368
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,300
There's a huge challenge with
the black box nature of AI

369
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,510
where an algorithm
arrives at its conclusion

370
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,609
and sees that this is no longer a Panda.

371
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,699
This is a Gibbon just with
a small picture vacation

372
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,700
or small change in, the image.

373
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,829
We have a project going
on with facial recognition

374
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,530
and AI with DARPA.

375
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,790
And we said, well, what's
the only thing that's as cute

376
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,330
or as funny as pandas and
that's of course will Farrell.

377
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,159
And it received what just small changes.

378
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,690
Sometimes in the image set in the data

379
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,070
we can actually manipulate the results

380
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,450
of the algorithm we can cause,

381
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,230
and that's really scary.

382
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,930
I mean, you're talking about
major, major ethics issues

383
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,930
major bias issues, major
issues, especially when

384
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,110
you're talking about AI controlling these,

385
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,550
critical systems that I'm
talking about in aviation

386
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,303
and the power grid.

387
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,560
Two of the big areas, common attacks

388
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,870
we talked a little bit
about, but really think

389
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,739
about poisoning, how the
algorithms trained in development

390
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,640
or in its cross validation
stage, or even in the testing.

391
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
So there's poisoning, and
there's also a vision attacks

392
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,730
which are carefully, carefully adjusting

393
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,340
and misclassifying the
results of the algorithm,

394
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,709
allowing that attacker to evade detection.

395
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,450
And, so part of the things,

396
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,880
some of the things we can do to get around

397
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,480
and defend ourselves from some
of those adversarial attacks

398
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,560
are really, it's really
reaffirms the importance

399
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,310
of understanding those
near boundary conditions.

400
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,310
So understanding where that
algorithm fails to detect

401
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,429
and what you can do is
during the learning stage

402
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,430
as you continue to attack
that, that algorithm to really

403
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,560
really have that a
really good understanding

404
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,970
of those near boundary
conditions, which is really

405
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,070
an area that an adversary
is going to focus on.

406
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,470
So having the completeness, a robust set

407
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,563
of current boundary conditions
is that absolutely critical.

408
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,820
We talked a little bit
about adversarial training.

409
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,520
Defensive distillation is a strategy where

410
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,560
we train the model

411
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,940
to output probabilities
of different classes,

412
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,730
rather than hard decisions
about which class to output.

413
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,340
And so then those probabilities
are supplied to the model

414
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,250
and then they're training the class

415
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,640
and was really hard labeled.

416
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,870
Which makes it different,
more difficult to exploit.

417
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,830
So with all of this,
with all these advances

418
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,449
some additional bad and ugly, is, again

419
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,140
AI for cybersecurity is not a panacea.

420
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,380
Let's go back to garbage in garbage out.

421
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,060
You need those rich data sets.

422
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,770
There's a limitation of cyber attack data

423
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,590
and cyber threat intelligence.

424
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,500
There's a limitation on
understanding the motivation

425
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,520
behind the attacks, why
they're being carried out.

426
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,670
So establishing those
classifications and feature sets

427
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,520
explainable the I is very difficult.

428
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,340
There's also the issue that
is if you drop an AI solution

429
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,540
on a network or a system
that's already compromised.

430
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,149
Think if you introduced an
AI cybersecurity solution

431
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,560
in the last eight months

432
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,149
when your network systems
potentially were infiltrated

433
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,150
through the solar winds attack.

434
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,190
And then that solution is trained on,

435
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,760
hey, this is what normal looks like.

436
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,450
This is normal, when in
fact you're compromised

437
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,680
you're getting a false sense of security.

438
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,540
I think the other issue is accuracy.

439
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,590
So if you're getting a
lot of false positives,

440
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,919
like think about the, as the pandemic hit

441
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,773
we all started to work
remotely work from home.

442
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,780
If your algorithms and
solution wasn't agile

443
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,170
and adaptable to that, and
could be tuned and trained,

444
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,790
you're gonna get prohibitive
numbers of false positives.

445
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,250
And just turn, the thing off

446
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,270
it's not going to be effective at all.

447
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,030
And then in the OTI CS space

448
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,639
or you have a lot of stochastic
loads, you have transients

449
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,850
you have computational
environmental human factors

450
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,429
that are changing what normal looks like.

451
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,200
Establishing that manifold
is very, very difficult.

452
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,100
A great example of that is,
think about a jet engine.

453
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,639
How do you develop an
industrial immune system

454
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,270
for a jet engine that's flying

455
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,889
at different times through
different environments?

456
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,150
There's a lot of pollutants
in certain environments

457
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,690
certain heat that will cause
a faster degradation curve

458
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,270
of that system.

459
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,750
And so how does your AI solution adapt

460
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,930
and recognize those
natural degradation curves

461
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,470
from the environment or
from how it's being operated

462
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,220
not a trivial task to do,

463
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,310
especially considering those
requirements to get it right?

464
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,580
Is that you can't have
those false positives

465
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,470
or it's not effective.

466
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,870
And so I, the solution we developed part

467
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,969
of our journey, it's called digital ghost.

468
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,310
We wanted to take a
very different approach

469
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,770
based on some of those
very sophisticated attacks

470
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,250
sophisticated attacks and
incidents we discussed earlier.

471
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,500
We wanted to look at the
physics of these systems

472
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,100
because while you can flip
a bit, one or zero to get

473
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,620
around a signature heuristic,
there's polymorphic attacks

474
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,250
AI attacks that are gonna
get around your firewalls.

475
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,470
The physics are more difficult to spoof.

476
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,990
And we have deep domain
expertise in the physics

477
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,970
of our assets.

478
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,950
We take a defense in-depth approach.

479
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,060
So to develop a digital ghost

480
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,919
we really brought together these really

481
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,770
really impressive multidisciplinary teams

482
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,450
from different backgrounds,
looking at everything

483
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,280
from how, white cells attack in your

484
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,680
your body's immune system
attack different viruses

485
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,510
and different diseases
when you're attacked.

486
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,660
We looked at this from a very,
very diverse perspective.

487
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,100
And what we started out with is, again,

488
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,399
you those two core components

489
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,730
of any effective AI cyber solution.

490
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,990
You need the domain expertise in the space

491
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,750
and the data scientists,
of course, as part of that.

492
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,840
And then you also need these really rich

493
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,230
big data sets to train.

494
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,380
And then once you have
those, what we've developed

495
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,063
we start out with a digital twin.

496
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,550
Sorry digital ghost starts
out with a digital twin.

497
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,480
This is high fidelity, almost
living, breathing asset

498
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,720
of the system, including
a high fidelity view

499
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,380
of the control systems of
the controllers, right?

500
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,070
Cause the controllers
can dictate the physics

501
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,000
of the overall system.

502
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,980
And so these are highly complex

503
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,173
tightly coupled systems of
systems with hundreds of sensors.

504
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,200
And so changes in the environment

505
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,300
and operations and
degradation curves can really

506
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,590
change what normal looks like.

507
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,510
So it's not easy to get rights

508
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,900
but this is where this is
the area we are operating in

509
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,193
because we, again, back to
some of those early incidents.

510
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,770
We've realized that once
an adversary gets in

511
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,530
and they no longer need
malware to cause damage.

512
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,889
We need to be able to look
at the health of the system

513
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,170
not only from a cyber attack perspective

514
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,810
but also from a fault.

515
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,149
We actually care less about
what's caused the natural

516
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,430
system to operate outside of its manifold.

517
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,310
And we'll work.

518
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,690
We have this ability in doing this

519
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,850
and taking this approach
to use our 40 machine

520
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,197
learning algorithms to detect

521
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:41,870
and localize where we've been attack.

522
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,520
So here, once we have that digital twin up

523
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,020
and we're training and
learning, we're attacking it

524
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,410
constantly using very
sophisticated attacks

525
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,510
to establish our manifold
of what's normal?

526
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,720
What's an attack?

527
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,880
What's a fault?

528
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,970
Establishing your features.

529
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,810
And this is exactly the type

530
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,780
of solution you're gonna
see that it's is different

531
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,822
than some of the failures we've seen with.

532
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,770
Let's say the Ukrainian
grid, cyber attacks

533
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,710
Stuxnet solar winds.

534
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,540
And that we're not focused on the ones

535
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,540
and zeros at the networking layer.

536
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,350
We're again, focusing on
what normal looks like.

537
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,439
So whether this is an insider attack

538
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,440
a zero day exploit operator
error, either way the machine

539
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,650
the digital ghost, the immune
system is going to recognize

540
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,150
that it's operating outside
of its normal manifold.

541
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,350
It's gonna be tapped in real time.

542
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,540
Exactly which one of those
sensors is being manipulated.

543
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,750
Localize the sensor.

544
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,620
And then it's gonna use those algorithms

545
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,590
and those other sensors
that are not compromised

546
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,882
to neutralize the impact of that attack.

547
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,760
And this is really a new
paradigm in cybersecurity.

548
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,740
This is a completely different approach.

549
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,520
We're saying that in these
converge it OT environments

550
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,250
with international supply
chains, we'll talk about hundreds

551
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,540
of thousands of lines of
code with malicious insiders

552
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,220
and adversary is going
to find a way to get in.

553
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,810
They're going to find like solar wind

554
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,149
some type of way to get
privileged access to your device.

555
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,820
This is more of a resilient solution.

556
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,470
And that once an adversary
gets in, we can respond.

557
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,220
We're covered in dirties attack

558
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,230
and keep these critical
assets running laundry attack.

559
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,230
And I wanna include with what
exactly does that look like?

560
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,220
But again, here you see, no

561
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,910
currently when there's some type

562
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,640
of falter attack on a
central sensor actuator

563
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,800
in a combined cycle power
plant, for example as seen

564
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
it could take hours.

565
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Hundreds of hours to locate
which sensor went bad

566
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,020
because you have this transient,

567
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,750
tightly coupled system.

568
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,110
And where one thing goes wrong,

569
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,600
it's gonna have an impact
on the system of systems.

570
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,409
So in addition to detecting localize

571
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,520
and neutralizing the cyber attacks,

572
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,020
other really exciting thing here

573
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,410
is we're no longer looking at cyber.

574
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,420
So cyber security is just a cost.

575
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,570
Or finding real ways
here to reduce operations

576
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,679
and maintenance and improve
efficiency, improve production

577
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,470
include improved energy management,

578
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,210
and then again back to
making a good operator great.

579
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,210
And so, that's what we're doing
here, very, very different.

580
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,180
It's not a panacea, but it's a unique way.

581
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,020
It's a unique approach to plot,

582
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,700
to apply advances in AI machine learning.

583
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,680
Advances in physics, advances
in compute storage mathematics

584
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,390
to really improve this DVR.

585
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,650
So this is what it looks like.

586
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,460
This is some of the live
testing we actually performed

587
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,250
on one of the world's largest
combined cycle power plants

588
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,100
where we said, we put
on our, our hacker hats.

589
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,399
And we said if we wanted to cause damage

590
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,540
to this critical system.

591
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,070
What are the sensors
actuators control systems

592
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,960
that we would try to manipulate
to cause the most damage

593
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,950
to the system in a
very, very stealthy way.

594
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,100
And you see the truth

595
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,469
versus the neutralization
algorithm of reconstructed.

596
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,120
So even in, well, during that attack

597
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,379
the scent we're using as
machine goes algorithms

598
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,120
to reconstruct the attack sensors.

599
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,129
The other way this could have played out

600
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,910
as we saw with Stuxnet.

601
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,060
With Stuxnet, you had
three, zero day exploits.

602
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,740
You had the human machine interface

603
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,560
telling the scientists
that everything's okay.

604
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,070
It's the center fusion
is, let's say spinning

605
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:54,070
at 30,000 RPM when it was
potentially spinning at $60,000 PM

606
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,210
and causing degradation and
destruction of the asset,

607
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,630
and a loss of trust between
these human mission teams.

608
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,640
And so well, the detection

609
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,580
and localization algorithms
are very, very mature.

610
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,330
We demonstrated a 99% accuracy.

611
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,439
So this was a major
scientific accomplishment

612
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,310
even with all that.

613
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,899
And we've demonstrated neutralization

614
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,030
major scientific accomplishment.

615
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,360
Even with all that, as I mentioned earlier

616
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,419
this is not a panacea, the gaps, the areas

617
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,270
the research gaps here
are, are very much related

618
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,220
to human machine interdependence, trust,

619
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,770
explainable AI, humble AI.

620
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,490
It's only with those advances
in filling those gaps

621
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,250
while we get to the third way
or artificial intelligence is

622
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,710
in fact intelligent.

623
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,510
We're far, we're still we still have,

624
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,330
a number of barriers
to that as I mentioned.

625
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,810
So in conclusion, and realizing here

626
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,950
I'm getting low on time.

627
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,160
You know, these are some of our results.

628
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,690
When you go back to your organization

629
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,630
when you either assess your
current AI driven solution

630
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,010
or consider investing in one, know that,

631
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,160
know what they're good at

632
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,320
and know where there's gaps.

633
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,490
Know where the opportunities
and challenges are,

634
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,540
Know the good, bad, and ugly if you will.

635
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,430
Remember that this is not
gonna replace your cyber team.

636
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,610
So if you're a Cisco or in
some type of cybersecurity role

637
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,620
and considering investment
in AI driven solution,

638
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,790
you need to really,
really understand things

639
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,139
like what's your level of false positives.

640
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,480
Are you able to detect

641
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,340
and localize attacks in a
converge it OT environment?

642
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,760
What type of OT protocols can you handle?

643
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,930
Or are you just dealing
with networking layers?

644
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,600
You're just dealing with TCP IP.

645
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,370
Remember also remember that

646
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,909
for any solution to be effective.

647
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,520
It's not about technology.

648
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,030
It's also about the people and process.

649
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,350
The form of the technology
has to compliment

650
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,240
the function of the team.

651
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,220
And so AI, cyber, as we
learned is very good to

652
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,300
help us scale and deal with the

653
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,169
the increase in volume of
attacks, not a panacea.

654
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,760
We know that as we adopt new
AI type drips driven solutions

655
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,780
and new TTP and new frameworks

656
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,629
our adversary will
continue to adopt similar

657
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,050
solutions to exploit the cemeteries.

658
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:26,050
Which will continue most likely
to be in their advantage.

659
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,170
So with that, I conclude

660
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,170
really appreciate the
opportunity to join the RSA team,

661
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,659
talented team and audience.

662
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,230
It's great to be back.

663
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,000
Please stay in touch.

664
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,133
Thank you very much.
