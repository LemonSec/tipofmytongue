1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,740
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,600
Thank you so much for joining me today.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,220
My name is Katie Nickels
and I work for Red Canary.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,440
And today I'll be talking to you

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,440
about advanced persistent
threat APTs and specifically

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,899
how I think our focus on APTs

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,270
in this cyber threat intelligence

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,490
and cyber security community
has kind of ruined CTI.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,869
I know it's a bold statement,

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,520
but hopefully at the end of this

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,470
you'll understand why I say that.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,020
And we'll go away with
some lessons learned

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,110
about how we can try to
focus on the right things

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,580
to produce the best actionable outcomes

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,483
from cyber threat intelligence.

16
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,180
A little bit about my background.

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,160
As I said, I'm the
director of intelligence

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,889
company called Red Canary.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,090
If you're not familiar, we do
manage detection and response.

20
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,050
You might also know of us
from our open source projects

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,519
like Atomic Red Team
that are a lot of fun.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,110
And me and my team, it's
kind of my dream job.

23
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,140
I get to look at a whole bunch of data,

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,120
about what adversaries are doing

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,500
and then try to take
that data and information

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,730
and produce actionable
intelligence that helps us

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,270
protect our customers and
protect the entire community.

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,500
So tracking threats is what I love.

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,890
I also teach for the SANS Institute,

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,320
unsurprisingly their cyber
threat intelligence course

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,830
and relevant to this talk my background

32
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,420
I have been in this community
for over a decade now.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,360
I originally started out as a civilian

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,510
in the US department of defense,

35
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,930
focusing on cyber threat intelligence.

36
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,940
That's what I love,
but I don't always work

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,700
I promise when I am not working

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,310
I like to work out on my back deck.

39
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,228
I do CrossFit at home, I also bake.

40
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:39,309
So those two things balance
each other very nicely.

41
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,790
And I'm pretty active on Twitter

42
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,880
so you can find me at
LikeTheCoins don't overthink it,

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,683
hint it's based on my last
name my Twitter handle.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,800
Cyber threat intelligence
that's my passion,

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,660
that's what I love.

46
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,039
So think for a moment you can
type it in chat if you want.

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,890
When you think of the term,
cyber threat intelligence CTI

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,940
what do you think of?

49
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,899
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,800
Most people have a few
different responses,

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,590
but one of the most common
one is people think of State

52
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,940
sponsored threats, advanced
persistent threats,

53
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,870
like China, like Iran or
Russia or North Korea,

54
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,680
or depending where you are in the world.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,990
The United States or Five Eyes countries.

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,270
Cyber threat intelligence
is a pretty big field

57
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,340
but I'm gonna guess that at
least one of you wrote APTs

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,240
'cause I primed you with
the title of my talk

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
or something that you thought of

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,780
was related to state-sponsored threats.

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,250
That's what so many people
have when they think,

62
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,283
think of when they think of CTI.

63
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,190
What is cyber threat
intelligence actually?

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,730
Well, there are a few
different definitions

65
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,470
but I love this one from my
friend Sergio Caltagirone

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,620
talks about a key a few key points

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,650
with cyber threat intelligence.

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,100
First off it's actionable.

69
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,620
Something isn't actionable
it's not intelligence.

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,420
About adversaries and their activities.

71
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,059
And then the last part of this,

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,310
this decision-making that is so key.

73
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,720
The outcome this actionable knowledge

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,440
should enable defenders
and decision makers

75
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,770
to make decisions.

76
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,670
Whether it's on what
techniques you should cover,

77
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,399
or where in your network
you should prioritize.

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,190
That's what cyber threat intelligence is.

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,240
All about enabling
defenders to make decisions.

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,830
You will notice even
though, you know, maybe APTs

81
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,780
were one of the first
things you thought of

82
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,760
when I mentioned CTI,

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,470
nowhere in this definition

84
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,380
or necessarily any definition
I've seen is APT mentioned.

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,253
Can be part of CTI, but it
is not the key point of CTI.

86
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,200
This idea of APTs. you've
almost certainly heard it

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,589
if you're at this conference,
what is this term?

88
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,550
Where did it come from?
And a few years ago

89
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,610
I started getting curious
about this myself.

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,030
You know we hear it all
the time in blog posts,

91
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,030
at media reports, APT, APT
well, where did it come from?

92
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,780
I started digging a little bit

93
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,880
and luckily in the fall, a
Colonel or Dr. Greg Rattray

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,100
came out with this tweet
that Richard Bejtlich

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,940
another respected member of our community

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,519
had alluded to before and Colonel Rattray

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,479
came out and said, it was me.

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,533
I coined this term back in 2007.

99
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,760
And like any good intel
analyst you know I trust him,

100
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
he's a doctor, he's a Colonel

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
respected person in this community

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,810
but I asked around, asked some people

103
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,600
who were around the Air Force at that time

104
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,890
and they all said, yeah, that seems right,

105
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,849
that jives with us.

106
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,660
And there's a link at
the bottom of the slide

107
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,670
that'll be available to you.

108
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,130
You can go check out
and hear him talk about

109
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,980
the advent of this term and
why it started to be used.

110
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,880
And really the way it was used initially

111
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,100
was that the Air Force and the DOD

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,880
needed to talk to private sector companies

113
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,580
in the defense industrial
base about some targeting

114
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,400
from Chinese groups, suspected
state-sponsored groups.

115
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
And they needed a term to communicate

116
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,180
about those adversaries.

117
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,860
And so that's where
based on multiple sources

118
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,670
that I found, I think are reliable

119
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,940
that's where this term APT comes from.

120
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,453
The need to communicate about
state-sponsored adversaries.

121
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,470
What we've seen is over the
years this term has grown

122
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,740
and continued to be used

123
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,270
initially it was just in DOD circles,

124
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,190
then you know in the
defense industrial base

125
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,960
and then in the broader public as well.

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,219
2007 kind of the early
creation of that term,

127
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,210
2009 there was a really
interesting operation

128
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,130
known as operation Aurora
or operation shady rat

129
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,090
that I think was significant

130
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,840
in the kind of progression of this term

131
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,590
because this was one of the first times

132
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,750
that the general public became aware

133
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,570
of state-sponsored threats being a thing.

134
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,240
I have on the slide a Vanity Fair article

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,300
talked about "enter cyber dragon."

136
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,820
This is a series of suspected

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,599
Chinese state-sponsored intrusions.

138
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,357
And to the use of the term APT,

139
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,920
around the same operation
the New York Times

140
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,270
actually had a piece
in which they discussed

141
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,659
the new fangled advanced
persistent threats

142
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,190
which was kind of funny,

143
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,210
but it tells us that in
this 2007-2009 timeframe,

144
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,780
this term APT was relatively new

145
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,412
at least to the general public.

146
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,940
Another key date in the
evolution of the term APT,

147
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,810
is really in 2013 when Mandiant
released their famous report

148
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,360
on APT1 a suspected Chinese
state-sponsored group

149
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,570
and this was a really key moment

150
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,120
in the entire cyber threat
intelligence community

151
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,660
in my opinion, excellent
report from Mandiant

152
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,550
you should still go back and read.

153
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,400
And this is important of
course because the group

154
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,633
was named APT1.

155
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,780
So Mandiant chose for their group naming

156
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,909
many ways to names groups
which I don't have time

157
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,230
to talk about today, for
any state-sponsored actors

158
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,270
and groups they use the designation APT.

159
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,500
So APT1 fairly well-known
report in the community

160
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,110
and since 2013, as I'm sure you're aware

161
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,670
this term APT just keeps being used.

162
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,520
And the challenge with it is
its origin was mostly to refer

163
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
to Chinese state-sponsored threats.

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,660
But it's become to be a little
more broadly used than that

165
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,253
and a little more complex.

166
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,030
Think about the term itself,
advanced persistent threat.

167
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,479
We know how it was initially used

168
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,990
but if you look at the term on face value

169
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,573
advanced, what does advanced mean?

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,090
There are different
levels of advanced right?

171
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,570
Do you have to be really
stealthy to be advanced?

172
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,159
Does a tool have to be custom
created to be advanced?

173
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,670
So advanced is a tough word

174
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,823
and then what about persistent?

175
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,980
How persistent?

176
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,970
I mean when with kids, right?

177
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,940
Those kids are probably persistent, right?

178
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,030
Does an APT have to bother
you every two minutes

179
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,960
to be persistent? Every day, every month

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,650
do they have to target you?

181
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,690
Should they be targeting you specifically

182
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,700
or your industry or
anyone to be persistent?

183
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,270
So these are some of the challenges

184
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,243
with this term advanced persistent threat.

185
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:17,659
That it was created
for a specific purpose,

186
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,940
but then over the years

187
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,030
it's kind of taken on a life of its own.

188
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,169
And so while this is a term
that we use in the community,

189
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,210
I'd suggest as much as you can

190
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,609
think about if there's
a more specific term

191
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,670
that you can use generally though,

192
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,230
I found that the term APT in the community

193
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,169
means state-sponsored and
that's how I'll be using it

194
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,169
through this presentation.

195
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,400
So we've talked about the
origin of this term APT,

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,459
some of the problems with it,

197
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,820
now let's talk a little bit about why

198
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,800
over the past decade plus, this term,

199
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,900
as well as the whole
overall concept of APTs

200
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,160
and state-sponsored actors,
why has that caught on?

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,650
Why is it something that
is one of the first things

202
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,793
you think of when I mention
cyber threat intelligence?

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,080
The first one, fear,
uncertainty and doubt.

204
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,940
Think of the hacker in
a hoodie or this image

205
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,500
for any Harry Potter fans might
make you think of dementors,

206
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,990
but this kind of imagery is
so common in our community.

207
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,200
This idea that we should fear adversaries.

208
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,050
We should be uncertain, we
should doubt our defenses

209
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,500
and that's fair I respect adversaries,

210
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I think we need to treat
them appropriately,

211
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
but to me spreading fear
without any solutions or actions

212
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,500
is something that we need to get away from

213
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,170
in this community.

214
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,079
And I think that this
spreading of FUD as I call it,

215
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,671
fear, uncertainty and doubt
has been one of the reasons why

216
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:50,060
APTs have caught on as such a
hot topic in this community.

217
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,199
Because people are scared and rightly so

218
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,410
we should have a level of
respect and fear perhaps

219
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,000
for our adversaries of
getting compromised by them

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,610
but again, being scared
without taking action

221
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,370
that's not useful.

222
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,780
And so many of us are
guilty of this, right?

223
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,420
In our conversations, in social media,

224
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,060
in reporting, in blog posts.

225
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,040
I would just encourage us all
to think very carefully about

226
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
are we ever spreading
fear, uncertainty and doubt

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,010
without giving actions or solutions?

228
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,900
I think that's one of the
reasons why APTs have caught on

229
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,033
so much over the past decade plus.

230
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,040
The next reason relates
to cognitive biases.

231
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
This is a topic that I love

232
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,790
because any intelligence
analyst has to be aware of these

233
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,329
cognitive biases, how our brains trick us.

234
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,460
And one of these biases
is probability bias.

235
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,700
So if anyone's played
roulette or been to Vegas

236
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,840
or ever gambled, you
know, think of that moment

237
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,790
before the roulette wheel starts spinning

238
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,560
and maybe even if you've read
a book about the odds in Vegas

239
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,910
of roulette and you know
your odds are terrible,

240
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,610
you still wanna believe right?

241
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,360
Us humans we wanna believe we
wanna believe we're gonna win,

242
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,170
we are bad at estimating probabilities

243
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,060
that's the idea of probability bias.

244
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,699
And this plays in with APTs as well.

245
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,960
We are inherently not
great at figuring out

246
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,210
okay how common are APTs really

247
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,620
in our environment, in our
industry, in this community?

248
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,440
Because of these various
cognitive biases we have, right?

249
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,720
Including that fear, uncertainty and doubt

250
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,120
if I read a story about an
advanced persistent threat,

251
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,740
state-sponsored adversary
that's really advanced

252
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,540
using these techniques,
you're gonna get scared

253
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,469
and your brain might start to overestimate

254
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,840
how likely it is that that
threat will affect you.

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,470
So that's another key
reason why APTs I think

256
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,500
are so persistent in our
brains to use that word

257
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
as the idea of probability bias

258
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,573
and that as humans we are not
good at estimating likelihood.

259
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,700
The next reason we
think of spy versus spy,

260
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,210
the sneaky person in the
bushes with the fedora.

261
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,920
Well, let's be honest,
espionage, it's kinda sexy,

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,540
it's kind of exciting to think about

263
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,150
we are gonna catch people spying.

264
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,319
And especially for me or anyone

265
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,150
from a counter intelligence
or intelligence background

266
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,010
you feel like this is the stuff

267
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,950
that we have to care about the espionage.

268
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,090
And as an analyst day-to-day
you know if you have a choice

269
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,870
between reading a blog
post about an intelligence,

270
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,570
a foreign intelligence service

271
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,773
and reading about the latest crimeware,

272
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,350
that blog post on espionage
might be a little more alluring,

273
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,340
it might be a little more exciting to you.

274
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,480
So I think this is another
one that we as a community

275
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,490
just have to be honest,
some of us just kinda think

276
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,680
espionage is sexy and cool,

277
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,770
it's a little bit alluring.

278
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,122
So, another reason why I
think APTs have caught on.

279
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,200
The last reason is one
that I haven't heard

280
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,420
too many people talk about.

281
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,530
This idea of where cyber
threat intelligence

282
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,223
this field was created
and how it's migrated.

283
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,010
This is where I get to
go to my background.

284
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,833
I started in this field in
the US Department of Defense.

285
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,740
You can bet for the US government,

286
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,330
cyber espionage is a key
thing we need to worry about.

287
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,560
Is it Russia? Is it China coming after us?

288
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,219
That is really important.

289
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,260
Advanced persistent threats
that's the origin of the term

290
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,270
in the Air Force by Colonel Rattray,

291
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,030
it's important to focus
on state-sponsored threats

292
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,943
in the government.

293
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,699
What's happened over the years

294
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,920
well, myself, like many others, right?

295
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,189
I moved on in my career,

296
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,910
I decided to come to the private sector

297
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,199
which is fun and has new challenges.

298
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,820
Many other people from government
and military did the same.

299
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,690
For example, a name you might
know Kevin Mandia of Mandiant.

300
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,110
He was previously in the Air Force

301
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,930
if you check out his bio.

302
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,870
A lot of the people who you think of

303
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,440
as cyber threat intelligence, you know,

304
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,470
foundational minds in this
field, in this industry,

305
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,930
folks like Sergio Caltagirone
wrote the diamond model paper.

306
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,020
A lot of these people
were in the US government

307
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,630
and military.

308
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,980
And why this matters when I'm
talking about APTs is that

309
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,430
as myself and others kind of migrated

310
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,300
from government to the private sector

311
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,339
whether it was Kevin creating Mandiant

312
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,820
or other folks like Dmitri Alperovitch

313
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,860
creating their own
companies like CrowdStrike,

314
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,340
we've taken our thoughts

315
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,900
and our biases from the public sector,

316
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,260
from the government to the private sector.

317
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,720
And I think that has actually contributed

318
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,220
to why the cybersecurity community overall

319
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,610
feels like advanced persistent threats.

320
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,870
The state-sponsored
threats are so important.

321
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,470
Because a lot of that thinking
and the foundations of CTI

322
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,683
many of those are in government sectors.

323
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,890
Now we've talked about what
APT is, what that term is,

324
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,250
where it came from and why
I think it's so pervasive,

325
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,530
but so what, why does that even
matter? Why is that harmful?

326
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,959
You know, what's the
point of my talk title

327
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,090
or that, how is this harming us in CTI?

328
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,060
A couple of reasons.

329
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,079
If our brains are so focused
on advanced persistent threats,

330
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,720
we can get distracted, we
can overlook other threats

331
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,360
that might be more pressing
to our environments.

332
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
Some analysts, some teams
will be divided out.

333
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,240
You know, you work on
Russia, you work on China,

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,590
you work on North Korea,
you work on crimeware.

335
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,810
Well what if crimeware is
the most prevalent threat

336
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,859
in an organization and
there's only one analyst

337
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,520
allocated to it but three to
other state-sponsored threats,

338
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,590
that misallocation of resources
can be a really challenging

339
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,450
piece to deal with,
especially for leadership.

340
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,830
And this is one of the reasons why

341
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,650
we have to really be
careful and think about

342
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,069
maybe we're focusing a little
too much on this idea of APTs.

343
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,250
And the other thing that happens

344
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,540
many analysts can probably speak to this

345
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,250
I know it's happened to me,

346
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,720
you're working on an
investigation an intrusion,

347
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,980
you're deep into it,

348
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,240
and then something comes out

349
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,860
about an advanced persistent threat.

350
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,200
You know, a blog post
from someone, a tweet

351
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,040
and your time gets distracted.

352
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,569
Maybe that new information
is the most important thing

353
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,730
to worry about, but maybe what
you were already working on

354
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,470
was more important.

355
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,910
And so this idea that maybe APTs

356
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,540
aren't always the most important threat,

357
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,372
very important for us to remember.

358
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,370
Let's take a look at some actual evidence

359
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,300
because I mentioned our cognitive biases

360
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,469
make us think, okay because
of this fear, uncertainty

361
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,340
and doubt, you know, we feel like

362
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,060
maybe APTs are really prevalent.

363
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,060
What does some data tell us realizing

364
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,603
that no data's perfect.

365
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,170
First off, this is a top 10
list from my team at Red Canary.

366
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,550
Basically we go through
the telemetry we bring in

367
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,370
through our customers and our partners

368
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,950
and we try to figure out,
okay what threats do we see?

369
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,590
You're wrapped up all of those,

370
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,450
and for 2020 here are the
top 10 threats that we saw.

371
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,310
We'll be releasing much
more about these threats

372
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,079
in our upcoming threat detection reports,

373
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,673
so keep an eye out for that.

374
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,103
Take a look here at this third column.

375
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,149
Any of these threats, are they exclusive

376
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,319
to state-sponsored actors or APTs?

377
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,780
And the answer for each of these threats

378
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,210
you see we have one group
mostly malware families,

379
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,830
no, none of these top 10
threats that my team tracks

380
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,280
are only used by
state-sponsored adversaries.

381
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,980
Of course, some of them take Cobalt Strike

382
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,210
we know that that's a tool that
state-sponsored adversaries

383
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,070
have used criminally focused
adversaries have used

384
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,139
a lot of different adversaries have used.

385
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,900
But the key takeaway that I
get from looking this data set

386
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,590
of our top 10 threats is that if APTs

387
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,399
were the most important thing,

388
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,230
I would expect to see at least one or two

389
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,940
state-sponsored groups up there

390
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,190
or maybe some of the malware

391
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,560
that we know is custom
to state-sponsored groups

392
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,940
but based on our data set,
that's not what we're seeing.

393
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,750
We're seeing that a lot of
it is the run-of-the-mill

394
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,510
crimeware type stuff or tools and malware

395
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,420
that are used by many
different adversaries

396
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,427
like Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz.

397
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,210
Of course the other thing to remember

398
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,540
all data has limitations.

399
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,730
My team, doesn't try to attribute

400
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,780
to state-sponsored threats.

401
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,470
We don't try to attribute to countries.

402
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,850
So, okay maybe our data set is limited,

403
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,909
we have a different focus.

404
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,270
So let's compare to what other people see.

405
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,510
None of us have all the data,

406
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,100
so in this community we need
to really combine our efforts

407
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,850
and our visibility.

408
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,990
So take this diagram from
a Crowd Strike Overwatch.

409
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,470
They were kind enough to share this

410
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,710
and give me permission to use it.

411
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,810
And of course Crowd Strike

412
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,320
they do quite a bit of attribution

413
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,240
to state-sponsored threats.

414
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,360
So this diagram breaks
down three main categories.

415
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,850
And these are interactive intrusions

416
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,709
that they were able to say were,

417
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,800
they were fairly confident
that they were malicious.

418
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,550
First category you see
up here in the light gray

419
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,639
and in this last quarter of 2020

420
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,410
it looks like roughly
half of those intrusions

421
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,363
they investigated were eCrime.

422
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,510
This dark gray here these
were unattributed intrusions

423
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,170
that they had high
confidence were malicious

424
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,240
but just weren't able to
attribute with high confidence

425
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,240
which time, topic for another
day, attribution is hard.

426
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
But then you see down here in red,

427
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,040
these are the targeted intrusions

428
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,879
that they were able to
associate and attribute.

429
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,100
And so what this tells us
again no data set is perfect,

430
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,719
but what it tells us is that
for the fourth quarter of 2020

431
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,840
the Crowd Strike Overwatch team,

432
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,350
the bulk of the intrusions
that they had saw

433
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,800
were either attributed to
eCrime or unattributed.

434
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,320
And that's even a group
that works to identify

435
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,810
state-sponsored threats day-to-day.

436
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,899
So again, no data set's perfect

437
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,840
but we're starting to, as
we piece together these sets

438
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,500
get a clearer picture that
perhaps state-sponsored threats

439
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
are not the most prevalent things

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,950
that a lot of organizations are seeing.

441
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,680
Another source Verizon released
a cyber espionage report

442
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,500
and they tracked what
they call breach patterns.

443
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,493
Again taking a look
here, web applications,

444
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,129
miscellaneous errors, crimeware
we're pretty prevalent.

445
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,640
If you compare crimeware that
was 10% of breach patterns

446
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,453
versus cyber espionage at 3%.

447
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,520
Again this isn't saying
well we know always

448
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,970
crimeware is more prevalent
than cyber espionage.

449
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,420
There are challenges because espionage

450
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,460
should be a little more stealthy,

451
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,490
but we would expect to see you know

452
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,130
maybe this would be a little higher

453
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,130
or at least we can say 10%
of what we saw was crimeware.

454
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,650
31% were web, involved web applications

455
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,603
so those things matter too.

456
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,290
So again, data is
imperfect and as analysts

457
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,560
we have to interpret
and assess what it means

458
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,440
but taken holistically my team,

459
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,050
the CrowdStrike Overwatch team,

460
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,870
what Verizon has compiled,
this data in totality

461
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,850
is telling me that perhaps
state-sponsored threats

462
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,653
are not the most common
thing that most teams see.

463
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,130
If we shouldn't focus just
on state-sponsored threats

464
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,433
well what should we care about?

465
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,900
First one, I mentioned
it boring old crimeware

466
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,250
another report on Emotet
they're back again

467
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,280
very common thing that analysts say.

468
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,330
And I think that you know in late 2020

469
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,800
analysts started to come
around to this idea that

470
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,220
maybe we need to take a look
at boring old crimeware.

471
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,480
So for example, the family known as Bazar,

472
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,790
Bazar loader and BazarBackDoor.

473
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,260
My team saw very directly,

474
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,390
what happens when a user opens
an attachment with Bazar.

475
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,240
We saw some discoveries,
some trust discovery

476
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,020
and then we saw the adversaries
dropping Cobalt Strike.

477
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,889
And based on cyber threat intelligence

478
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,970
from other intrusions we've
seen and others have seen,

479
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,160
we knew that we had to move
quickly as they move laterally

480
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,550
through this network because otherwise,

481
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,853
almost certainly ransomware
was going to follow.

482
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,540
So a lot of people maybe
wanna overlook you know

483
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,813
Qbot, Emotet, Bazar it's just crimeware,

484
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:26,410
it's not sexy state-sponsored stuff

485
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,950
but boring old crimeware
is incredibly important

486
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,520
to watch out for because we
call them ransomware precursors.

487
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,450
And a lot of this boring old crimeware,

488
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,010
if it doesn't deliver ransomware,

489
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,560
it will often deliver some
other second stage payload

490
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,720
that steals data.

491
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,363
So, don't overlook the
boring old crimeware.

492
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,870
Next one, right? Leading up
as I said Bazar ultimately

493
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,570
we've seen lead to Ryuk ransomware.

494
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,830
We have seen a huge rise
ransomware over 2020

495
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,470
and I do not expect
that to change in 2021.

496
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,520
This diagram is from my friend Allan Liska

497
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,200
who takes together public
reporting on ransomware attacks.

498
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,530
This one shows us State
and local governments

499
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,139
and you can see a pretty steady increase

500
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,740
just based on public
reporting of ransomware

501
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,540
against these governments.

502
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,110
But sources all over are
seeing the same thing.

503
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,429
My team has as well.

504
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,120
Ransomware is here to stay.

505
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,909
And that's one of those threats
that if you find yourself

506
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,600
getting completely distracted
by state-sponsored threats,

507
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,689
this is one you might overlook.

508
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,463
Gotta take ransomware seriously.

509
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
So ransomware is oppressing a threat,

510
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,500
but what about this threat
Business email compromise.

511
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,610
Take a look at these figures.

512
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,679
This was from 2019, but I
don't expect the FBI's numbers

513
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,120
from 2020 will be any different.

514
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,566
for $1 sign for ransomware right?

515
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:56,490
$8.9 million of loss that was
reported to the FBI in 2019,

516
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,420
business email compromise
caused 1.7 billion,

517
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,560
B, billion in 2019 of losses.

518
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,700
That is a lot more, my friend
actually double-checked

519
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,610
that I had these numbers right.

520
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,139
Business email compromise
this is where an adversary

521
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,800
might email someone and try to
trick them into wiring money.

522
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,340
You know, my CEO might
say Katie, I need money,

523
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,470
I'm overseas, wire money.

524
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,220
And this is a threat that as
cybersecurity professionals

525
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,370
we cannot afford to overlook, right?

526
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,239
We can't get distracted by just APTs

527
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,390
'cause the losses here are huge.

528
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,380
And I think BEC the challenges,

529
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,530
it's not just a cybersecurity challenge,

530
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,280
it's also a process challenge.

531
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,560
But this is a threat that we cannot afford

532
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,113
to overlook as a community.

533
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,920
Another thing I often hear from
people as we talk about APTs

534
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,240
is this idea that well
advanced is that first word.

535
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,060
Advanced, so they must use
really advanced techniques.

536
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,470
Let's take a look and kind
of unfurl that a little bit

537
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,610
in this section, using my former team

538
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,523
MITRE ATTACK's framework.

539
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,170
MITRE ATTACK of course the framework

540
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,940
of different adversary behaviors.

541
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,530
And what I've done here is
I've used the ATTACK Navigator,

542
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,260
an open source tool to just create

543
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,460
what's called a layer this matrix here

544
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,200
and I just went through
and based on information

545
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,890
that MITRES mapped, I said,
let me select the APT groups,

546
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,860
the groups that are suspected
to be state-sponsored

547
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,080
or known to be motivated by espionage.

548
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,210
So I went through and I
just selected those groups.

549
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,420
A lot of the APTs from FireEye and others.

550
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,190
I said, let's color those techniques

551
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,493
that they use red.

552
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,170
Okay, next one, I went through and I said,

553
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,980
groups like Fin7 financially motivated,

554
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,770
criminally motivated groups.

555
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,070
Let me select those groups

556
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,173
and the techniques that they
use let's color those blue.

557
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,209
You can probably guess what comes next

558
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,530
red plus blue equals purple.

559
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,750
So when purple what we have in this matrix

560
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,230
are the techniques that we've seen used

561
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,620
by both state-sponsored APT actors

562
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,892
and financially or
criminally motivated actors.

563
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,970
And of course, this is a limited approach,

564
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,350
this is a limited methodology.

565
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,020
It's not everything that
every group has ever done,

566
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,950
but based on the evidence that we have,

567
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,320
you can see there are a
lot of purple techniques.

568
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,310
And what that says is,
and this is consistent

569
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,030
with what my team sees day-to-day.

570
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,340
You know, there's a lot
of use by adversaries

571
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,679
of encoded PowerShell.

572
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,300
Doesn't matter if they're state-sponsored

573
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,470
or they're criminally sponsored,

574
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,290
they use encoded PowerShell.

575
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,710
A lot of these techniques
are used by adversaries

576
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,140
regardless of motivation.

577
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,320
So that's another kinda myth

578
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,852
I wanted to bust around APTs.

579
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,080
There are some techniques
that are particularly advanced

580
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,070
and exclusive to state-sponsored actors

581
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,883
but a lot of what adversaries are doing,

582
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,370
lots of adversaries are doing them

583
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,933
regardless of their motivation.

584
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,380
Here's an example of that in fact.

585
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,580
This was over the summer
the Australian government

586
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,210
came out and talked about
series of intrusions

587
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,390
they called the Copy-Paste compromises.

588
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,750
And right here in this
snippet from their report

589
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,940
you can see they called it
the Copy-Paste compromises

590
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,050
because the adversaries used tools copied

591
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,533
almost identically from open source.

592
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,113
Think back to that point I made
earlier on what advanced is.

593
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,290
Is copying from open source
tools really advanced,

594
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,420
maybe, maybe not, but
this is a sophisticated

595
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,590
state-based actor.

596
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,889
So you can start to see
an example of what I said,

597
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,170
you know, advanced persistent threats

598
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,260
they don't always have
to use advanced tools.

599
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,100
And a lot of adversaries are
using the same kind of tooling

600
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,050
and techniques such as those

601
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,082
behind these Copy-Paste compromises.

602
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,520
What's the point here?
What does this tell us?

603
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,450
As I said, there's significant overlap

604
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,700
between techniques and
tools that are used by APT

605
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,200
and non APT groups.

606
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,010
Of course there are a
couple various sophisticated

607
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,750
techniques I won't use the word advanced,

608
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,160
very sophisticated techniques

609
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,630
or custom built tools to evade defenses

610
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,780
but honestly those are less common.

611
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,660
Maybe it's because we just don't see them,

612
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,740
but the bulk of the information

613
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,480
that I talked about earlier right?

614
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,610
What are the common threats we're seeing?

615
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,409
It's a lot of the common
techniques and tools

616
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,363
that are used by lots of
different adversaries.

617
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,548
That's the bad news, right?

618
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,680
APTs for a lot of reasons
that we talked about,

619
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,360
we focused on them quite
a bit as a community,

620
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,469
and that can harm us by
taking our focus away

621
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,930
from the threats that really matter.

622
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,283
Well, how do you make sure you
focus on the right threats?

623
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,760
Good news, there is hope

624
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,210
and so let's talk through that

625
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,110
as we start to wrap up our discussion.

626
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,890
And thinking about this problem

627
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,467
of focusing too much on APTs

628
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,669
someone asked me, where
is this problem, Katie?

629
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,870
Where is it in the intelligence cycle?

630
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,239
If you're not familiar,
this is just the cycle

631
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,850
that intelligence goes through
planning and direction,

632
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,000
collection, analysis,
dissemination, et cetera.

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And my opinion, a lot of
the focus on APTs comes in

634
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,629
at this planning and direction phase.

635
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,240
Because of what we talked about, right?

636
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,980
Those reports that we read, the
fear, uncertainty and doubt,

637
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,300
our cognitive biases and
so if we can start to plan

638
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,399
for our cyber threat intelligence better,

639
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,420
that's gonna help us,
hedge against this problem

640
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,060
of focusing too much on APTs.

641
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:39,949
Part of planning and direction,

642
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,590
you have to form requirements.

643
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,600
Any a CTI team and these are just problems

644
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,889
that you wanna solve or try to address

645
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,390
with cyber threat intelligence.

646
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,407
Maybe they're questions
you're trying to answer.

647
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:52,530
A couple examples,

648
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,420
you know maybe you wanna know what assets

649
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,920
in my organization are at the highest risk

650
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,670
to be targeted by adversaries,

651
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,540
or maybe what gaps do
we have that you know

652
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,370
might be exploited by adversaries
using certain techniques.

653
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,689
Because if you know the gaps,

654
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,610
the defenders can then take
that intelligence and fill them.

655
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,610
So these requirements trying to focus on

656
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,560
what you actually need from
your cyber threat intelligence.

657
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,710
The questions you need to ask,

658
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,110
it's a great way to hedge against

659
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,110
focusing just on APTs because
maybe you end up figuring out

660
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,610
that you have visibility
gaps an APT might exploit

661
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,740
maybe you don't.

662
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,870
But focusing on your
requirements and your needs

663
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,419
helps you make sure you
focus on the right threats.

664
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,840
The other key thing we
can do to help us focus

665
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,899
on the right threats is
called threat modeling.

666
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,320
And this is a concept that
a lot of software creators

667
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,110
use as well but from an
intelligence perspective

668
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,189
I think a threat modeling
is just matching up us.

669
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,540
Our organization, our
assets, and matching that up

670
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,190
with adversaries and threats.

671
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,780
Trying to figure out, okay what do we have

672
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,090
that an adversary might
try to steal or compromise.

673
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,480
And looking at the
overlap between those two

674
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,450
that's how you get the threats

675
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,210
and the threats that really matter to you.

676
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,310
I've written about this,

677
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,659
there's a link in the bottom

678
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,470
if you're interested in threat modeling

679
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,660
and an intelligence
based approach to that,

680
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,210
it's a whole separate presentation.

681
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,840
But simply stated threat modeling

682
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,280
is about bringing together what you have

683
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,899
that the adversaries care about

684
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,730
and trying to think about the threats

685
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,143
that might be most likely
to affect your organization.

686
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,250
If you don't do threat modeling

687
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,250
here's what happens to
a lot of organizations.

688
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,840
You will read media
reports, we all do that.

689
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,399
We read blog posts, right?

690
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,460
Our leadership asks us
about certain threats

691
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,690
and we have in our mind
the things that cause fear,

692
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,900
uncertainty and doubt.

693
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,770
And so those things become the them.

694
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,220
We think of the adversaries
that we need to worry about,

695
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,250
it's whatever we're hearing,

696
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,870
whatever our mind tells
us we need to focus on

697
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,760
and predictably, if
that's what you rely on

698
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,490
to figure out the threats
you need to focus on,

699
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,440
you're almost certainly gonna
say we have to focus on APTs.

700
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,740
If you do threat modeling though,

701
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,990
and you take time to
think about what threats

702
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,590
will really affect us,

703
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,030
maybe you look at what threats
have you seen in the past

704
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,093
for your organization or your industry.

705
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,670
What's most likely to target
you based on what you've seen

706
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,680
or others have seen, or your
knowledge of adversaries.

707
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,420
Or what's most likely to impact you.

708
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,600
You start to think carefully
and do threat modeling,

709
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,870
that's gonna result in you
focusing on the threats

710
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,229
that really matter.

711
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,020
Maybe it's some that I talked
about for most organizations

712
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,600
it's almost certainly gonna be ransomware.

713
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,010
Maybe the threats that
matter to your organization

714
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,490
after you do this threat
modeling include APTs

715
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,770
and if they do awesome, that is fine.

716
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,270
If it meets your requirements,

717
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,020
you might wanna focus on APTs,

718
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,050
but what I've found
for many organizations,

719
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,730
when they sit down and think honestly

720
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,800
about the threats that matter to them,

721
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,050
it ends up a lot of those

722
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,072
are not advanced persistent threats.

723
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,780
Wrapping up here with
a couple of takeaways

724
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,920
that I hope you leave this
presentation on your mind.

725
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,630
First off we talked about that term APT.

726
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,650
Colonel Rattray created it.

727
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,830
It's really evolved over time.

728
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,970
And generally people use it to
mean state-sponsored threats

729
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,010
but it can be problematic.

730
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,920
And so I'd urge you to think
about, do you use that term?

731
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,200
Or are there other more precise
terms that you could use?

732
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,320
Other key takeaway I'm all
about cyber threat intelligence

733
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,149
about informing decisions.

734
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,360
Remember CTI is not all about
advanced persistent threats.

735
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,082
The point is to inform better
security decision-making.

736
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,209
Next one, it can be really
harmful to organizations

737
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,720
if you focus too much on APTs.

738
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,260
It can distract your time
from threats that matter,

739
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,270
but the good news is, that
by focusing especially

740
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,730
in that planning and direction phase

741
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,340
of the intelligence cycle,

742
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,570
you can start to use
things like requirements

743
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,850
or doing threat modeling,

744
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,270
to make sure you focus
on the right threats

745
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,630
and have the best chance at
being able to successfully

746
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,163
defend your organizations.

747
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,699
You've got some homework,

748
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,439
I know it's easy to
listen to a presentation

749
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,659
it's harder to action that.

750
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,250
So your action items, today or this week.

751
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,670
Maybe just have an honest
conversation with your team.

752
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,460
How do we figure out what
threats we choose to focus on?

753
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,130
Right? Are we just thinking it's APTs?

754
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,960
Do we have any kind of methodology?

755
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,969
And if you don't have a
methodology maybe next month

756
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,770
start to build out some requirements,

757
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,630
a basic requirements list,

758
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,870
build out some kind of a threat model

759
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,150
and that's gonna take time
to do it's not an easy task.

760
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,760
So maybe a good goal within a year,

761
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,989
start to prioritize
the threats that matter

762
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,709
based on your requirements
and your threat model

763
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,300
which will be a never ending journey

764
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,050
That you'll have to face

765
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,003
as a challenge for your organization.

766
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,339
And with that thank you
all so much joining me.

767
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,580
Shortly I'll be having a live Q and A.

768
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,140
So if you have any questions for me

769
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,580
you wanna dive deeper on any topics,

770
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,960
please feel free to join that.

771
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,940
We'll put that in the chat

772
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,520
and you can find it on
the homepage as well.

773
