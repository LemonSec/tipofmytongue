1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,563
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:02,820
My name is Jason Rivera.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,160
I'm the director of the Strategic Threat

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,670
Advisory Group at CrowdStrike.

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,590
And today I'm gonna talk to you about

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,900
some of the experiences that I had

7
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,866
as a cybersecurity
professional, around responding

8
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,593
to COVID-19 and how it's forever changed,

9
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,420
a lot of corporate
America's attack surface.

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,680
So here's what we're
gonna be going through

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,930
in terms of the agenda.

12
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,790
We're gonna talk about how we
got here in the first place,

13
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,250
and some of the dynamics that shifted

14
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,900
from the old normal to the new normal.

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,020
And then we're gonna talk a little bit

16
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,107
about how the attack surface changed and,

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,530
how what different threat actors did

18
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,080
and how they adapted to the changes

19
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,050
and basically global business.

20
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,300
And then lastly, we're gonna
talk about some suggestions

21
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,958
or basically recommendations
on how we can adapt

22
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,613
our organizations to the new normal.

23
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:46,570
So let's go ahead and jump
into the introduction.

24
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,860
And probably the best
way to characterize it,

25
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,830
is that the world changed pretty quickly.

26
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,211
So on February 27th of this
year, so we're in 2020 still,

27
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,940
on that day I was at the
last RSA and everything

28
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,300
was business as usual,
all the displays were up,

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,970
the booths were there,
the talks were happening.

30
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,429
There was no mass requirements,

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,520
no stringent sanitation requirements.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,369
Literally I was having meetings constantly

33
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,280
like one after the next, after the next,

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
shaking hands, meetings with PAC.

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,979
So again, February 27th
the world was one way

36
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,010
and then suddenly you transition
maybe two weeks later.

37
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,900
So March 13th, suddenly the
total nationwide lockdown,

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,860
100% remote workforce.

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,270
And then, obviously then
there's unprecedented reliance

40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,780
on the internet, everybody's scrambling,

41
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,530
everybody's trying to
figure out what to do

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,670
and that forced us all to
use the internet more than

43
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,130
we ever had in the past.

44
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,660
And that was really a big piece here.

45
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,270
That's was one of the
things that the adversaries

46
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,770
picked up on very quickly.

47
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,070
They realized that a lot of the victims

48
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,410
that they wanted to go after
were increasing their reliance

49
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,130
and therefore they really
started to change things.

50
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,140
So a lot of the
adversaries were very quick

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,840
in how they adapted their lures

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,310
to include COVID-19 theme messaging.

53
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,830
So for example, on this one on the left

54
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,620
that I'm showing you, this is an email,

55
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,200
this is a phishing email that
was sent on February 4th.

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,840
So this is way before it was even declared

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,170
a national emergency.

58
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,725
Already, they're
impersonating the CDC asking

59
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,990
for different types of ...
trying to get people to go

60
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,289
to different sites,
download malicious content.

61
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,459
So these threat actors
picked up on it very quickly.

62
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,190
Just look at the rate
at which they sent this,

63
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,480
all the way back on February 4th.

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,700
And then it wasn't just fishing.

65
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,601
A lot of it was some of these
donation schemes as well.

66
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:23,552
So in this case, there's
an email from an actor

67
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:26,250
pretending to be the
World Health Organization

68
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,630
and basically asking for
donations in Bitcoin,

69
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,230
which is never a good sign by the way.

70
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,512
No one should ever be asking for donations

71
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:33,170
from you from Bitcoin.

72
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,280
But again, what this
demonstrates is the ability

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,730
of these actors to rapidly
adapt their various schemes

74
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,780
to the times that they're in.

75
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,780
And then as we watch this go
into the months after that,

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,410
the actors eventually
got way more creative

77
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,750
in their approach as well.

78
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,710
And they started actually
developing even capabilities.

79
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,490
So what you're looking at
on the left for example

80
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,280
is a fraudulent malware
written Android app.

81
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,400
And basically what it does is
it's supposed to be designed

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,790
to help you understand it
there are COVID-19 infections

83
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,090
around you and if you are in a risky area.

84
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,430
So then of course, a lot of
people downloaded this thing

85
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,280
and then it even came with
the texting capability to talk

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,720
about like, oh, hey, there's
a new urgent message.

87
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,952
And all of this was designed
to steal information

88
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:20,620
and basically go after
the people's private data.

89
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,430
But again, this really
speaks to the ingenuity

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,910
of the actors themselves
and their ability to even

91
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,740
conceive of this, let alone deploy it.

92
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,630
And then on the right, what
I'm showing you is an example

93
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,750
of like one of those visualization sites.

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,631
So all of us has seen them
like there's different types

95
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,920
of visualization sites
that basically show you

96
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,250
how something is growing, or
how something is changing.

97
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,470
So the threat actors also
tried to go after these

98
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,010
and impersonate these as well.

99
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,799
They basically created
them with the intent

100
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,270
of driving web traffic
to those malicious sites.

101
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,160
And then again, stealing information,

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,930
getting the victim to interface
with malicious applications,

103
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,560
so on and so forth.

104
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,990
So this had a really
big effect on the world.

105
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,420
And what we're gonna look at now is just

106
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,410
from a pure numerical perspective,

107
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,390
how big of an effect this was.

108
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,350
So what you are looking at
is our CrowdStrike intrusion

109
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,329
telemetry starting from
the quarter one of 2019,

110
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,190
all the way up through the
end of quarter two, 2020.

111
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,310
We do have quarter three out,

112
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,130
but that came out after
I created this brief.

113
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,780
So we're a little bit behind on the data

114
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,339
but basically what it's showing
is it's showing the increase

115
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,174
in intrusions over time.

116
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,190
So this gray block here that's eCrime.

117
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,680
This black space right
here that's unattributed.

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,180
And then this red space here,
those are nation's data,

119
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,670
state-sponsored actors.

120
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,230
As you can see the
state-sponsored actors remaining

121
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,163
relatively static over time.

122
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,690
It's not really changing.

123
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,430
You're just relatively stable.

124
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,270
However, you look at these E-crime actors,

125
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,260
you see a steady increase
all throughout 2019

126
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,900
and probably the best
explanation for that one

127
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,469
is around the threat of ransomware.

128
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,860
And basically, when
ransomware attacks happen

129
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,297
not only do they hurt the
victim but they also inspire

130
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,697
other ransomware actors
to also get into the game

131
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,300
and to do more ransomware attacks.

132
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,340
So it's this thing that
keeps on compounding

133
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,869
on top of itself.

134
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,410
So that helps us understand in 2019,

135
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,397
but then you see this big
spike in quarter one, 2020.

136
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:06,710
And what happened here was
basically a combination

137
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,039
of a couple of things.

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,220
The first was COVID-19.

139
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,283
So going back to what I
said on three slides ago,

140
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,810
we had to use the internet more than

141
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,140
we ever had in the past.

142
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,120
What does that mean?

143
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
Well, if we're using the internet more

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,229
that means we have a
larger attack surface.

145
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,639
We have a larger attack surface could mean

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,670
more complex attack surface.

147
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,350
Also, which in turn would allow
the adversary opportunities

148
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,200
or additional opportunities rather,

149
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,090
to get into a target environment.

150
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,049
So, it created this really the situation

151
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,870
where we're having to use VPNs more,

152
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,790
RDP more, basically the situation

153
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,150
where our attack surface is much larger.

154
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,950
And then on top of that, our adversaries

155
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,680
also quickly adapted started
using more techniques

156
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,914
such as like ransomware
as a service, for example,

157
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,506
whereas like a lot of ransomware operators

158
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:52,000
started outsourcing a large
portion of their operations,

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,080
which in turn resulted in
a larger volume of attacks.

160
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,359
So not only do you have a
larger volume of attacks,

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,320
now you have a larger attack surface,

162
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,010
those two things combined
are really what explains

163
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,580
this big jump that you see right here

164
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,592
in the beginning of this year.

165
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,669
And some other key notes that
I thought were interesting

166
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,140
we saw a 98% increase in distinct

167
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,375
and sophisticated intrusions
from 2019 quarter three,

168
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,570
to 2020 quarter three.

169
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,240
And of course that begs the question,

170
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,630
what exactly is a distinct
and sophisticated intrusion?

171
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,490
Well, basically what it boils
down to, is that distinct

172
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,780
and sophisticated intrusion,

173
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,140
according to CrowdStrike
language is the term

174
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,180
that we use to call something
that we've never seen before.

175
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,670
So for example, if we see a
particular type of intrusion

176
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,710
that is using different types of tactics

177
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,030
or maybe a novel type of malware,

178
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,152
or maybe the way that
it's moving laterally

179
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,420
is just different than
anything we've seen before

180
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,850
in the past, basically doing
something entirely different.

181
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,170
So what I'm really saying
here is that we've seen

182
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,593
a huge increase in the
adversaries complexity,

183
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,120
in nearly 100% increase more
of these types of attacks

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,860
from quarter three of last year.

185
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,120
So not only are we seeing
a larger volume of attacks,

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,940
but the attacks themselves
are also more complex

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,400
using more novel capabilities.

188
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,789
And then the other thing that
I thought was interesting

189
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,630
to note, with some of
the intrusions statistics

190
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,469
that we looked at from a
CrowdStrike perspective,

191
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,305
we saw that approximately
75% of those attacks

192
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:18,230
within North America leveraged
fileless techniques only.

193
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,810
So what I'm saying here is really hands

194
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,970
on keyboard techniques, things like using

195
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,500
legitimate credentials,
RDP compromise, PowerShell,

196
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,200
basically things that do not
require the use of malware

197
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,010
in order to achieve their objectives.

198
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,980
So again, 75%, so that that's
obviously way more than 50%.

199
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,310
So way more than half.

200
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,919
So this again increases the complexity

201
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,215
and further exacerbates the
challenges faced by defenders.

202
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,429
So here's some of the
common themes that we saw

203
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,770
from the time that COVID-19
became a significant issue

204
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,315
within the public eye.

205
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,630
The first one was web distribution.

206
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,870
So basically with web distribution,
what we're seeing here

207
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,020
is we're seeing adversaries
go after these sites

208
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,859
that distribute public information.

209
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,378
So for example, public health
sites, or it could be like

210
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,801
those information visualization sites,

211
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,140
they know a lot of people
are going to those sites.

212
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,070
So therefore adversaries
focus their efforts

213
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,040
on compromising those
locations and then using those

214
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,170
in order to engage in lateral
access or get credentials

215
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,929
or whatever it may be.

216
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,330
The next one is situational phishing,

217
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,229
and situational phishing
is a term that I'm using

218
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,090
to describe phishing in conjunction

219
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,070
with a largely well-known situation.

220
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,500
So for example, COVID-19, or
an election, or a protest,

221
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,010
you see a lot of threat
actors take these widely

222
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,780
known situations and then
form their phishing campaigns

223
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,432
around those with the
intent of not only going

224
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:45,280
after a specific target, but
then using a well-known event

225
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,949
to amplify the message
and increase the sense

226
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,440
of urgency of the victim.

227
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
So we definitely saw a lot of that

228
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,490
from nation state adversaries, as well

229
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,300
as criminal adversaries.

230
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,290
The next one goes back to
what I was saying earlier

231
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,370
about the attack surface.

232
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,810
And like I said, the attack
surface is much larger.

233
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,270
We're all working from home.

234
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,880
We have to somehow securely connect back

235
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,568
into the office environment
or connect back to

236
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:08,819
network based applications,
whatever it may be.

237
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,340
So a lot of that stuff
requires the ability

238
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,390
to connect remotely,
and to do it securely.

239
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,813
So protocols such as
RDP or VPN connections,

240
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,439
we're seeing a lot more
compromise of those

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,963
given our increased reliance
on those as a society.

242
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,760
And then lastly, we saw a
lot of information operations

243
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,060
being used by our adversaries
in order to affect

244
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,010
the thinking of the population.

245
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,000
So we saw this in the political arena.

246
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,400
We've seen it in terms of COVID-19,

247
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,610
and basically we know what
our adversaries are doing

248
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,500
is they're trying to manipulate the way

249
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,140
the population thinks in
order to get that population

250
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,260
to do something or think a
certain way, and in terms

251
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,939
of how it would benefit
the other nation state.

252
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,686
So we're seeing a lot of that primarily

253
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:53,070
from the big four adversaries,
such as Russia, China,

254
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,430
Iran, North Korea, and then from some

255
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,859
other adversaries as well.

256
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,050
But again, the design of
this is to get the population

257
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,433
to think in a certain way.

258
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,420
Also of note, we saw a huge increase

259
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,709
in the amount of COVID-19 themed lures.

260
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,130
And just to illustrate that increase

261
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,143
from what we saw from a
CrowdStrike perspective,

262
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:12,890
in February we saw maybe about
10 COVID-19 themed lures,

263
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,480
whereas in March, it jumps
up to well over 1,000.

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,840
And that trend continues
all the way into May,

265
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,980
capping off at around 1,250.

266
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,370
So I would contend that a lot
of what this brought to light,

267
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,230
a lot of what COVID-19 showed
us is how difficult it is

268
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,560
to really understand the
problems we are facing,

269
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,530
particularly when those problems
are changing very quickly.

270
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,470
And one of the ways that I like
to think about the necessity

271
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,770
of understanding problems
is I like to take a quote

272
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,760
from Einstein and something
that he once said.

273
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,640
And Einstein once said that,
if he had an hour to save

274
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,650
the world, he would spend 55
minutes defining the problem

275
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,520
and about five minutes solving it.

276
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,730
Yeah, in the cybersecurity
industry, for some reason

277
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,380
we do that backwards.

278
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,720
It's like, we want to
solve problems first.

279
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,400
We wanna set out fires
and play whack-a-mole.

280
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,047
But I talked to so many organizations

281
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:00,810
and in many cases it does feel like

282
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,160
we're reacting to things a lot.

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,130
It's like you see this
threat pop up here and okay,

284
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,580
I'll go after that one.

285
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,740
All right, good, I got it.

286
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,230
Oh no, another one.

287
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,720
So I see a lot of organizations
going from threat to threat,

288
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,729
alert to alert, but not
really understanding

289
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,900
the underlying basis
of why it's happening.

290
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,740
And there's a lot of ways that I see this.

291
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,610
In many cases, we'll see organizations buy

292
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,560
expensive solutions, but
not really understand

293
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,479
the problem that they're trying to solve.

294
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,120
In some cases it's now
we bought the solution.

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,770
And now you're reacting to alerts here

296
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,110
and reacting to incidents,
but yet once you

297
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,400
resolve the alert or resolve the incident,

298
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,579
a lot of organizations, again, they still

299
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,500
don't really understand why it happened.

300
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,340
What was the reason in the first place?

301
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,970
And the challenge of
this is that the longer

302
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,640
you play whack-a-mole,
eventually you lose the game

303
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,170
and eventually the mole gets through.

304
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,760
And that's the chats, that's ultimately

305
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,080
how these breaches occur.

306
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
It's a strategic surprise.

307
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,450
I think it was a good term
to really think about,

308
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,390
when you think about why breach occurs

309
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,120
because if you were to
ask, the CSO the day before

310
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,457
he or she found out about the
breach, he or she would say,

311
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:03,480
"Oh yeah, everything's fine.

312
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,550
We're doing all the right things.

313
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,750
We understand our threat
vectors," so on and so forth.

314
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,647
And then you ask the
day after and it's like,

315
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,720
"Oh, wow yeah, of course, I can't believe

316
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,770
I didn't see that."

317
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,603
Well, yeah.

318
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:13,780
And a lot of that happens
because we're not aware

319
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,980
of the underlying problems
that we are facing.

320
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,360
So we're gonna talk a lot
about that when it comes

321
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,870
to understanding problems
and that's how we're really

322
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,800
gonna think of the attack surface.

323
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,256
And one of the good ways
to understand this problem

324
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,430
is to imagine it as this threat landscape,

325
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,750
which consists of you and the adversary.

326
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,040
And basically the name of the game is that

327
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,640
your ability to defeat cyber
threats rest pretty much

328
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,850
almost entirely on your
understanding of the problem.

329
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,980
Because if you understand
the problem well enough,

330
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,090
if you know what your
adversary is capable of,

331
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,010
if you know what your vulnerabilities are,

332
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,490
if you know what you're trying to protect,

333
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,150
and you know what malware
the adversary has,

334
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,100
and what their different
infrastructure capabilities are,

335
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,310
and their different TTPs
are, if you know those things

336
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,689
then you are pretty well positioned

337
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,620
to succeed against the adversary.

338
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,060
So that's our goal with these
next few slides is to really

339
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,146
talk about that and how that changed

340
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,880
as a result of COVID-19.

341
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,220
So one way to think of the
threat landscape is again,

342
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,570
to compare yourself against the adversary.

343
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,530
And when I talk to customers,
I like to think of it

344
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,313
across three echelons, strategic,
operational and tactical.

345
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,000
At the strategic layer on our
side, it's good for companies

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,030
to think about, what industry are they in?

347
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,540
What are your critical assets?

348
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,740
What is it that allows
you to stay in business?

349
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,550
Those are the most
important things about you.

350
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,016
And it is those things
that will ultimately

351
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,270
'cause an adversary to target you.

352
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,130
So for example, when we
think of the adversary

353
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,360
they have motive and intent,
for a financially motivated

354
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,210
actor who might be interested in eCrime.

355
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,540
They might target, financial
assets of a company

356
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,930
or perhaps a espionage motivated actor,

357
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,089
interested in national security secrets.

358
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,470
Maybe they'll go after
a federal organization

359
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,660
and try to take their
national security data

360
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,300
or their strategic asset.

361
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,867
So that's one way to think
of it at the strategic level.

362
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,910
And then at the operational
level, we can think of ourselves

363
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,760
as a function of people,
process, technology.

364
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,270
Whereas on the adversary side,
I find it useful to think

365
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,920
of the adversary at the operational layer

366
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
as a function of their capabilities.

367
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,410
So for example, malware,
social engineering, so on

368
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,640
and so forth and then
their infrastructure.

369
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,280
So where do the capabilities
come from, from which domains,

370
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,920
which IP addresses, so on and so forth.

371
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,099
And I like to think about
the interplay between how

372
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,930
the adversary might use their
capabilities against us.

373
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,979
So for example how might they use malware

374
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,530
against our technology?

375
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,749
How might they socially
engineer our people?

376
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,000
How might they take advantage
of a vulnerable process?

377
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,380
So it's good to think about these things.

378
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,120
And then lastly, at the tactical layer

379
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,883
we have the attack
surface, and we wanna think

380
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,710
of our internal attack service.

381
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,560
So what are the applications
or operating systems internally

382
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,660
that we are using that could
potentially be vulnerable?

383
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,750
How might the adversary
penetrate our perimeter?

384
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,470
What are some of those
perimeter vulnerabilities,

385
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,940
maybe it's a email gateway,
or maybe it's a firewall,

386
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,400
what are those vulnerabilities
that we need to consider?

387
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,130
And then lastly, what are the external

388
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,400
vulnerabilities that we have?

389
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,970
Do we have reliance on
cloud services, external

390
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,870
applications, different types of websites,

391
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,880
it could be a bunch of different things.

392
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,439
But again, the way that I like to think

393
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,570
of the attack surface is
to think of it across,

394
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,320
internal perimeter and external.

395
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,690
And then also I like to think
of the adversaries TTPs.

396
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,990
So what exactly are they
going to do to break through

397
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,320
one of these areas?

398
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,840
And ultimately what we're talking
about here, today at least

399
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,270
is the attack surface.

400
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,810
And that's where we're
really gonna focus on.

401
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,589
We're gonna look at how this
attack surfaces has changed

402
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,373
since the COVID-19 pandemic.

403
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,670
So let's take a look at this across

404
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,430
the three different categories.

405
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,790
So first we have internal,
we have perimeter,

406
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,310
and then we have external.

407
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,080
So in the pre-COVID world,
in the realm of internal,

408
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:46,650
really, it was much easier
to define network boundaries.

409
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,079
We knew where the assets were.

410
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,113
We had a better understanding
of which applications

411
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:53,440
were needed, where the end
points were, where they resided,

412
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,620
how they were protected.

413
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,490
There was a much better
understanding of that.

414
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,390
Whereas post-COVID the
transition to this remotecentric

415
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,090
workforce, suddenly people have to connect

416
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,910
in all sorts of weird ways.

417
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,930
And the challenge of this
is now, what is internal?

418
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,300
What is external?

419
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,800
If we don't all work from
this office environment,

420
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,830
is there necessarily even
an internal capability

421
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,340
or an internal environment
anymore at this point?

422
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,123
Actually, I'm gonna start the slide over.

423
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:22,643
All right, so now let's take a look at how

424
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:25,180
the attack surface changed
and maybe look at some

425
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,930
of the differences between
the pre-COVID timeframe,

426
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,620
and the post-COVID timeframe.

427
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,700
And we're gonna look at this
across internal perimeter

428
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,400
as well as external.

429
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,000
So from an internal
perspective, what we saw

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,340
in the pre-COVID timeframe
is internal assets

431
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,974
such as critical workloads,
endpoints, applications,

432
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:44,810
and data contained within the
defined network boundaries.

433
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,550
All of these things were
just very well-defined.

434
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,410
We knew where things were,
whereas in the post-COVID

435
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,600
timeframe, because we now have
this remotecentric workforce.

436
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,340
Now we have increased
exposure to internal assets

437
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,230
because now somebody from
the outside of the protected

438
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,230
environment is having to
VPN back in, or RDP back in,

439
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,720
coming from a place that's not necessarily

440
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,119
part of the protected network.

441
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,899
So you're seeing a lot more
ambiguity on what exactly

442
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,253
is internal and what exactly is external.

443
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,630
The next one we have is
around the pre-COVID ...

444
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,400
what we're looking at from
a pre-COVID perspective

445
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,630
at the perimeter.

446
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,920
So again, pre-COVID
organizations are largely reliant

447
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,410
on this perimeter
environment, these firewalls,

448
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,910
physical appliances,
email gateway solutions,

449
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,420
their reliance on things to
protect this environment.

450
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,830
And they really believe in the
integrity of the environment.

451
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,310
Whereas in the post-COVID timeframe

452
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,780
like we discussed earlier,
if you have to VPN back in,

453
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,040
or if you have to RDP
back in, or if again,

454
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,659
people are working from
outside of the environment,

455
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,770
suddenly what is the
notion of a perimeter?

456
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,620
It doesn't necessarily apply anymore.

457
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,205
Externally, on the
external attack surface,

458
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,270
in the pre-COVID era
there was really a clear

459
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,927
differentiation between internal
and external environments

460
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,919
and the Internet's really
characterized by a normal

461
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
amount of web traffic.

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,450
So there weren't in huge
spikes, we understood

463
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,200
what were the assets that we're protecting

464
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,220
within our boundaries?

465
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,820
What are the assets that we rely on

466
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,639
with our cloud service providers?

467
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,660
However, in the post-COVID
environment, again,

468
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,140
we see this huge transition
to the remote workforce

469
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,000
and now it's essentially the
reliance on cloud capabilities,

470
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,070
skyrockets, whether it's cloud
cybersecurity, cloud storage,

471
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,439
other types of cloud services.

472
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,230
There was a lot more
reliance on these services

473
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,470
once COVID became really
a big international issue,

474
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,070
and people were trying to
figure out how do they use

475
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,270
these services and integrate them

476
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,020
as part of their operational environment?

477
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,889
The challenge of that then came between,

478
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,990
well, what is internal?

479
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,130
What is external?

480
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,170
If we have critical data
in this cloud storage area,

481
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,960
should that be considered
internal because it's critical.

482
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,770
So I guess basically what I'm saying here,

483
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,660
is there's lots of confusion.

484
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Especially with
organizations that are trying

485
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
to rapidly adapt to all this
and trying to figure out

486
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,740
what the new normal is.

487
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,810
It could be a very confusing situation.

488
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,620
And then of course, the more
confused we are as defenders,

489
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,600
the more opportunities
that our adversaries have

490
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,203
to exploit that confusion.

491
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,720
Let's take a look at how the
adversary changed their tactics

492
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,400
both in the pre-COVID 19 timeframe,

493
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,530
and the post COVID-19 timeframe.

494
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,750
So pre-COVID, we see
them focused on big game

495
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,370
hunting, ransomware operations.

496
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,669
Basically going after these
large enterprise, wide targets,

497
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,700
in order to get the maximum payout.

498
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,555
And then they also focused a
lot on data theft and fraud.

499
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:25,483
Really focused on stealing PII
and then monetizing that PII

500
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,490
into criminal underground.

501
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,977
In the post-COVID timeframe,
we see a big increase

502
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,810
with ransomware as a service attacks,

503
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,560
we see that volume increase.

504
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,898
And again, ransomware
as a service is where

505
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,280
these ransomware operators
are now outsourcing

506
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,350
to affiliates.

507
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,709
So for example, last year in 2019

508
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,700
let's say there were maybe 10
major ransomware operators.

509
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,550
What we're seeing with the
affiliate program is that

510
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,139
when they have these affiliate programs,

511
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,260
they'll outsource from somewhere

512
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,379
between 15 to 25 affiliates.

513
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,480
So you could go from a situation
where you have 10 major

514
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,720
ransomware operators last year
to around 250 different types

515
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,270
of ransomware operations this year.

516
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,530
So that again, huge increase in volume.

517
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,170
And then we also saw the
emergence of data extortion,

518
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,070
which increased the attack severity.

519
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,870
So basically with data
extortion, what you're looking

520
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,169
at here is when the ransomware
actor on top of conducting

521
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,350
the ransomware attack
then extorts the victim

522
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,840
with their own data, typically PII.

523
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,260
And what they'll do is they'll
threaten to sell that PII

524
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,240
in the criminal underground if the actor

525
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,470
doesn't pay the ransom.

526
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,900
So not only does the
victim potentially have

527
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,580
their entire environment to lose,

528
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,320
but they can also lose that data

529
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,889
to the criminal underground as well,

530
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,590
basically suffering a double blow.

531
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,389
So this next one we're
gonna talk about is some

532
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,890
of the pre-COVID tactics that we saw used

533
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,380
by nation state adversaries.

534
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,130
And really, they were just
focused on business as usual.

535
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,943
So normal national security
and economic focused espionage,

536
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,500
depending on the type of country
and what their needs were.

537
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,275
And again, that varies
from nation to nation.

538
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,610
And then of course we saw
a lot of use of the cyber

539
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,540
as a tool of international influence.

540
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,300
And when I say that, what
I'm really talking about here

541
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,073
is information operations using
different types of websites,

542
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:01,960
using different types
of personas to influence

543
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,930
and sway the world in their favor.

544
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,010
Whereas post-COVID, just
the eCrime adversaries

545
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,200
we saw the nation state adversaries

546
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,820
adapt pretty quickly as well.

547
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,290
We saw a huge increase
in COVID-19 themed lures

548
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,190
and downloaders, and this was
across all of the adversaries.

549
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,296
All of them started using
COVID-19 as a way to get

550
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:21,880
their initial hook into environments.

551
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,840
And then we also saw a
huge increase on focus

552
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,830
around epidemiological
technology and decision-making.

553
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,250
So with epidemiological technology,

554
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,971
what I'm saying there is
really focused on like

555
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,130
what are all the technologies
that were developed

556
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,440
as a result of COVID-19.

557
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,340
Whether it's vaccine related
technologies or different types

558
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,209
of medical technologies, even
communication technologies,

559
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,830
a lot of development has
been happening since COVID-19

560
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,270
and that is a huge focus
of our adversaries.

561
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,698
And they're also very focused
around the decision-making,

562
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:53,124
decision-making of our
policymakers of our military,

563
00:21:53,124 --> 00:21:55,750
they're trying to figure out
what is the United States

564
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,780
gonna do, or what is this
European nation going to do,

565
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,550
given a certain circumstance
or given a certain situation.

566
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,629
So again, like I said earlier,
our adversaries did really

567
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,470
demonstrate this capacity to rapidly adapt

568
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,149
and like the more they
evolved through the time,

569
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,459
the more you see this as a normal part

570
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,930
of their way of operating.

571
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,920
And that's a really
important aspect of this,

572
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,610
you want to be able to adapt to things

573
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,332
in order to go with the times.

574
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,500
So this next one is around the way forward

575
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,880
and some recommendations
around how to evolve

576
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,815
in this post COVID-19 era.

577
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,220
And one of the ways that
I like to think of this

578
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,670
is you're pretty much in a situation

579
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,120
where you need to evolve
or get left behind.

580
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,300
And given that I'm
proposing four evolutions.

581
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,740
So evolution one is decreasing reliance

582
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,253
on the idea of a perimeter.

583
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,483
Evolution two is prioritizing
simplicity and adaptability.

584
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,498
Evolution three is evolving
from reactive to proactive.

585
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:55,320
And evolution four is around
the ability to prepare

586
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,047
the workforce for the new normal.

587
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,570
I'm gonna do a slide on each of these

588
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,230
and just do a deep dive, but again here's

589
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,300
my four broad recommendations.

590
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,490
So let's dive into these.

591
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,380
So this first one is
around decrease in reliance

592
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,140
on the idea of a perimeter.

593
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,120
And really the premise here
is to no longer conceive

594
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,146
of yourself or your
organization as operating

595
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:17,389
within this safest space.

596
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,000
And one way to think of
this, is we should probably

597
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,170
now treat the endpoint as the
heart of your IT environment,

598
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,180
endpoint is the new perimeter.

599
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,140
So basically treating
every single endpoint

600
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,330
as its own protected asset
and not necessarily relying on

601
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,159
these different types
of network technologies

602
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,783
to keep the adversary out.

603
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,538
And another way to think of
this is really focusing on

604
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:38,670
zero trust architecture.

605
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,967
So basically verifying the
identity of the individual.

606
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,860
Trusted conductivity
between endpoints and apps.

607
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,360
Visibility and the security
attributes on the endpoints.

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,139
Basically, you don't want to
have to rely on good faith.

609
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,350
You want to be able to verify things.

610
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,780
And then lastly, we wanna
consider the possibility

611
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,010
that now everyday household
items, such as, IOT,

612
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,950
are now part of the battlefield,
so proceed accordingly.

613
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,770
So your printer, your coffee
machine, your whatever,

614
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,050
we're all working from home.

615
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,740
And we all use our local
internet, our local router

616
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,100
to connect back even
to an office workspace.

617
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,070
So we should also be
considering how our IOT

618
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,560
plays into that.

619
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,899
By the way, for any of you
who have any questions,

620
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,050
we are available in the chat
to be able to answer those.

621
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,590
So if you have any questions,
feel free to type those in

622
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,939
'cause I know I'm moving
at a pretty fast rate.

623
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,040
So next one, evolution
two is around prioritizing

624
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,290
simplicity and adaptability.

625
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,470
And really the goal here is
to understand that simplicity

626
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,470
is your friend, whereas,
complexity not so much your friend

627
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,870
those are the things
that 'cause us to fail.

628
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,679
So, one principle to think
of is that no battle plan

629
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,750
will survive first contact with the enemy.

630
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,590
And this is actually an old
military saying, but it really

631
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,959
holds true in the cyber realm as well.

632
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
We can prepare all we want, we can do

633
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
all sorts of preparation but
when you get to game day,

634
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,020
when you get to a real
situation where you are facing

635
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,119
a real incredible threat,
that threat is likely

636
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,990
to look different than the
things that you prepared for.

637
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,050
So we want to be able to have our ...

638
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,909
our plans need to be flexible.

639
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,300
And to do that, we don't really wanna have

640
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,730
like specific too granular plans.

641
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,140
We wanna have broad guidance
with some specific tasking,

642
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,170
but we wanna rely on our
leaders and our people

643
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,490
to make the right decisions.

644
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,600
Because if the plan is too
cemented, then it won't be able

645
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,423
to adapt to what the adversary does.

646
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,960
So the next principle here
is to realize that simplicity

647
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,120
is your friend, and complexity
favors your adversary.

648
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,832
So think of it like
this, if you're gonna use

649
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,020
different types of security technologies,

650
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,300
if you're gonna rely on different types

651
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,649
of cloud technologies
or whatever it may be,

652
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,380
I would think about how you
can consolidate, less is more.

653
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,720
How can you have a less
agents on your machine?

654
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,750
How can you have a less complexity,

655
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,487
more comprehensive
protection, instead of relying

656
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:52,170
on lots and lots of
different capabilities?

657
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,270
How do we narrow that down?

658
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,910
Because the challenge of relying on a lot

659
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,910
of different capabilities
to protect yourself

660
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,000
is now that's a lot of opportunities
for a mistake to happen

661
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,760
'cause each one of those
organizations that you rely on

662
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,350
that is a potential avenue
into your organization.

663
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,469
So we wanna think about
how can we narrow that?

664
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,300
How can we really make the
battlefield much more simple

665
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,342
and thereby much easier to protect?

666
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,236
And the the other thing
I've realized is that

667
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:22,790
the only constant in life is change,

668
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,000
and that applies to the
cyber realm as well.

669
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,450
The adversary's always adapting,
always creating new types

670
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,630
of capabilities, new types of malware,

671
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,630
new types of social engineering schemes,

672
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,800
new types of botnets.

673
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,071
And they are always
evolving their tactics.

674
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:38,709
And so accordingly, we need
to be adaptable to that.

675
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,530
If they're gonna rapidly
adapt what they do

676
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,889
and change the way they
operate, then we also need

677
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,240
to get used to rapidly
adapting our defenses

678
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,893
and making them more dynamic
as opposed to static.

679
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,430
The next evolution is around evolving

680
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,290
from reactive to proactive.

681
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,030
And what we really wanna focus on here

682
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,360
is how can we be much more
proactive in our behavior?

683
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,709
That's one of the
challenges of cybersecurity.

684
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,180
Cybersecurity began as this
inherently reactive discipline.

685
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,290
See the alert, address the alert.

686
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,945
Receive the incident,
respond to the incident.

687
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:11,750
It's always like something
has to happen first

688
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,890
and then, oh, okay.

689
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,130
Then we go after it.

690
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,590
Again, like I said earlier though,

691
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,449
the challenge of just
waiting for things to happen

692
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,620
is eventually it doesn't go your way.

693
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,139
Eventually you get subjected
to strategic surprise.

694
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,530
So we wanna think about what
are the proactive things

695
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,990
that we can do in order to
mitigate some of those surprises.

696
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,330
So, one big recommendation
is using threat intelligence

697
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,310
to preemptively understand threats.

698
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,409
And one way to think of it is like this,

699
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,500
the most likely thing to happen to you

700
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,550
is whatever just happened to your peer.

701
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,820
If something happened to your peer

702
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,919
and that peer has a
similar business to you

703
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,370
then that is probably something
that you need to know about.

704
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,899
And that is ultimately
what threat intelligence

705
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,130
helps you understand.

706
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,080
Threat intelligence helps you
understand how these breaches

707
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,210
are happening globally,
what the adversary's

708
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,320
capabilities are.

709
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,379
And it allows you to
understand those capabilities

710
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,700
and to prepare accordingly
as opposed to having

711
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,230
to experience those capabilities firsthand

712
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,383
for the first time.

713
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,750
The next recommendation I have here

714
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,970
is around threat hunting.

715
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,050
And what I'm talking to a lot
of my customers about lately

716
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,000
is the need to engage
in intelligence-driven

717
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,920
and hypothesis-focused
threat hunting operations.

718
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,316
And what I mean by this is
a lot of threat hunters,

719
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:17,400
they just do whatever
their gut tells them.

720
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,125
Which, okay, that is one way to do it

721
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,150
but that's not very methodical.

722
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,350
One more proactive, and one
much more methodical way

723
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,230
to do this is to use
intelligence-driven information

724
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,700
to do those threat hunts.

725
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,440
So like I said earlier, if
you are peer just got breached

726
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,040
by something and you know
the adversary who did it

727
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,149
and if you know what
capability they leveraged,

728
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,600
I would contend that you need
to run that as a threat hunt

729
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,209
inside your own environment.

730
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,183
So again, it's like how
we use the information

731
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:45,860
around what's happening
around us to really hone in

732
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,479
and do these specific threat hunts

733
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,680
to go after these more
advanced adversaries.

734
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,270
And the last one on this
slide is the around the need

735
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,800
to achieve a common operational
picture of the threat.

736
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,790
And what I mean by this is,
different security teams

737
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,389
need a way of seeing the
same problem, the same way.

738
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,310
And what I mean by this is
the threat intelligence team

739
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,480
needs to have the same
understanding as the SOC,

740
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
which needs to have the same understanding

741
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,750
as the incident response,
so on and so forth.

742
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,880
Everybody needs to have
a similar understanding

743
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,510
of the threat because if one
team has one understanding

744
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,129
of the threat, but another
team has another understanding

745
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,550
then suddenly this guy is
gonna do this thing over here

746
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,490
and this guy's gonna do
that thing over there.

747
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,740
And suddenly what they're
gonna do is not really gonna

748
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,000
jive with each other.

749
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,910
So using intelligence and
using that understanding

750
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,590
of the adversary to achieve
a common operational picture,

751
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,580
not only make sure that we're all in line

752
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,939
and all doing the right thing,

753
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,480
but it also helps us be more efficient

754
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
which is very important
in this day and age.

755
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,290
And then the last evolution
that I'm proposing

756
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,909
is around the need to
prepare the workforce

757
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,070
for the new normal.

758
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,540
So what do I mean by that?

759
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,421
Now the first one is we
have to be ready to combat

760
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,300
the threat of misinformation.

761
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,770
So our adversaries are not
going to stop doing this.

762
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,050
They're going to continue to use

763
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,810
these global events against us.

764
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,280
They're gonna use COVID against us.

765
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,840
They're gonna use politics against us.

766
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
They're gonna use all these
different things against us.

767
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
So we need to be ready for that.

768
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,620
But with nation state and
eCrime adversaries alike

769
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,409
are not gonna change
this tactic anytime soon.

770
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,380
The next one I would
consider is the accounting

771
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,150
for the use of fear
tactics by our adversaries.

772
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,390
And when I think about
COVID-19, one of the reasons

773
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,510
that these COVID-19 lures
work really well is 'cause

774
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,650
they really strike to the
fear in people's hearts.

775
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,230
And of course, COVID-19,
it's this raging pandemic.

776
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,420
It is deadly, and it obviously
has huge implications.

777
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,120
And our adversaries
know this, and therefore

778
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,929
that's why they focus on
this because they know

779
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,860
that you as a victim are
much more likely to interact

780
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,290
with something that you are afraid of.

781
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,120
You are much more likely to
click when you are afraid.

782
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,580
So we have to be ready for this,

783
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,370
'cause it's not just gonna be COVID-19,

784
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,620
there's gonna be other hardships
throughout this planet,

785
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,500
and other elections, and other
things that are really gonna

786
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,760
'cause a lot of global
notoriety and global tension.

787
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,200
And we need to be ready for
the use of these fear tactics

788
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,820
by adversaries who would seek to exploit

789
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,020
these things against us.

790
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,070
And then lastly, I would
challenge that we need to think

791
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,120
of identity as the new perimeter.

792
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,479
And here's what I mean by this,

793
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,210
We already tried the
network as the perimeter,

794
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,390
that didn't work, even
just relying on endpoint

795
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,640
security products, that by itself

796
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,190
not necessarily gonna work.

797
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,590
So we need to have this multiple
way of really validating

798
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,570
and vetting who is on these machines,

799
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,210
who exactly is doing what?

800
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,030
So I would contend that
we really do need to go

801
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,590
to this zero trust mindset
where we're thinking

802
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,740
about who is using the
machine, how is this machine

803
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,560
connecting to these applications?

804
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,110
Is this behavior normal?

805
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,110
Really thinking about the
behavior and the identity

806
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,240
of the individual itself as opposed

807
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,390
to just the characteristics
of the machine.

808
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,075
The more that we can
get to this, I would say

809
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,960
that this would really
be the next evolution

810
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,240
and how we can truly get
closer to protecting the core

811
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,140
of our organization and the
core of our IT infrastructure.

812
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,940
So I'll end with something
that I talked about earlier.

813
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,020
And then again, if you have any questions

814
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,400
feel free to put them in the
chat, we'd be happy to answer.

815
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,680
But, I'll end with this.

816
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,830
Ultimately we really
do wanna really realize

817
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,750
that it's just you and the adversary.

818
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,039
There's you, and all
the things that you are

819
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,560
trying to protect.

820
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,770
And there is your adversary.

821
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,790
Your adversary is trying
to take things from you.

822
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,790
It could be they're trying to take

823
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,360
your national security secrets.

824
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,860
Maybe they're trying to take your money.

825
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,830
They're trying to take
your intellectual property.

826
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,510
Whatever it is about you, whatever it is

827
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,550
that you're doing well
and that is 'causing you

828
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,919
to succeed as a business.

829
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,470
Those same reasons that you
are successful, are the same

830
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,020
reasons that your adversaries
are going to attack you.

831
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,889
So I would challenge
and contend that we need

832
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,730
to understand these reasons.

833
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,490
Not only do we need to
understand the reasoning

834
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,810
of the adversary, but we need

835
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,460
to understand their capabilities.

836
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,270
We need to understand
their infrastructure.

837
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,790
We need to understand their TTPs.

838
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,540
We need to understand everything
that they are capable of.

839
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,480
And we need to know a lot more about them,

840
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,250
than we currently do now.

841
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,510
And again, the reason I say
this is I'm just pulling

842
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,760
up a quote from what I said
earlier, your ability to

843
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,990
defeat cyber threats, rest almost entirely

844
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,940
on your understanding of the problem.

845
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,930
If you truly understand the problem,

846
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,750
and if you truly understand
what the adversary's capable of

847
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,430
then you will make the right decisions.

848
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,830
You will make the right judgment calls.

849
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,030
You will hire the right people.

850
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,232
You will buy the right stuff.

851
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:03,129
But if you are not aware of
what the adversary is doing,

852
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,820
and if you are not aware
of their capabilities

853
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,129
or infrastructure, then that
adversary will eventually

854
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,830
catch you by surprise.

855
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,629
So that (indistinct)
call to action on this.

856
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,540
I do urge us to really think
about how can we really

857
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,300
enhance our understanding of the problem

858
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,460
and how can we enhance our
understanding of adversaries

859
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,030
in order to protect our environments.

860
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,170
So thank you for your time.

861
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,760
Like I said at the
beginning, my name is Jason.

862
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,940
I'm the director of the Strategic Threat

863
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,490
Advisory Group at CrowdStrike.

864
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,410
We are available on chat
to answer any questions

865
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,243
that you might have.

866
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:29,490
So feel free to type those in,

867
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,830
and I hope you enjoy the
rest of your RSA conference.

868
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,663
Thank you.
