1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,399
- So today, we're here to
discuss the issue of ransomware.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,890
and the topic of paying
ransomware, specifically.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,760
And what kind of risks may be involved

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,590
in paying ransomware in
the context and background

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,060
of the Department of Treasury's
most recent guidelines

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,270
with respect to the payment of ransomware.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,939
First, before introducing
our two speakers to you,

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,880
I want to just let you know

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,879
that there is a chat on that
you can submit questions to

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,100
while the recording is being played.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,830
And there'll be a live
session in which the speakers

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,290
will be able to answer those questions.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,820
So I suggest and offer that up

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,860
to you as you listen to
please submit your questions.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,030
So good day.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,170
Good afternoon.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,210
My name is Catherine Lotrionte.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,160
I'm a professor at Georgetown University

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,910
and also work at the center for,

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,470
so at CSIS in Washington,
D.C., a think tank in D.C.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,770
Today, I'm happy to introduce
to you two gentlemen

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,200
who will be discussing this very important

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,690
and also timely topic about ransomware.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,480
First, we have today with us, Adam Hickey.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,900
Adam is a deputy
assistant attorney general

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,880
at the National Security Division

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,960
at the Department of Justice.

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,050
At the Department of Justice,

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,200
he oversees both Counterintelligence

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,860
and Export Control, the Section

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,940
and the Foreign Investment
Review Section at DOJ.

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,360
Among other things,

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,400
he supervises investigations
and prosecutions

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,850
of foreign state-sponsored
computer intrusions and attacks,

35
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,679
enforcement of the Foreign
Agents Registration Act or FARA

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,660
and the National Security Division's

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,539
Foreign Investment Security Reviews.

38
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,210
For example, how CFIUS works.

39
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,089
We also have Stewart Baker.

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,300
Stewart is a partner

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,580
in the Washington D.C.
office of Steptoe & Johnson.

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,060
He served as general counsel

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,240
at the National Security
Agency and assistant secretary

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,570
for policy at the Department
of Homeland Security.

45
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,440
At DHS, he was responsible

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,579
for policy analysis across the department

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,530
as well as for the department's
international affairs,

48
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,980
strategic planning and relationships

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,709
with law enforcement and
public advisory committees.

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,560
With that introduction, I'd
like to offer an opportunity

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,760
for both Stewart and Adam.

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,410
And then let's begin with Adam.

53
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,640
Adam, I'm hoping that you can
kind of lay the groundwork

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,640
giving us some background on
the Department of Treasury's

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,690
guidance on the payment of ransomware

56
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,490
recognizing that you're
not at Treasury Department

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,940
but as the government official,
current government official

58
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,000
in this discussion, I think
you can lend some insight

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
as to what the guidelines says
and what it means for people

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,090
both in companies that may
be victims of ransomware

61
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,788
or others in the community

62
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:08,033
that might have some
involvement in ransomware.

63
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,903
- Sure, happy to.

64
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:11,903
And good morning to you.

65
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:14,929
At least when we're recording this.

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,600
Thanks for having me on the panel.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,480
And Stewart, great to see you again.

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,420
I'm looking forward to this.

69
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,000
I think it's gonna be a lively

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,623
and challenging conversation,
at least for me.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,910
And to our audience, thanks for tuning in.

72
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,020
So just to set the baseline

73
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,800
or lay a foundation for the conversation.

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,810
In October 2020, Treasury
issued an advisory

75
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,860
on potential sanctioned risks

76
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,030
for facilitating ransomware payments.

77
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,943
And I'm gonna summarize it briefly.

78
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,190
Essentially, it reminds its
audience that if you engage

79
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,350
in transactions with a
sanctioned entity or a person,

80
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,310
you can be civilly liable.

81
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,160
And Treasury has the authority

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,880
to bring an enforcement action

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,090
even if you didn't know
that's what you're doing.

84
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,930
It's a strict liability standard.

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,790
And that includes four
ransomware actors or groups

86
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,720
of actors that have been
designated in recent years.

87
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,183
Since 2016, treasury has
designated CryptoLocker, SamSam,

88
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,169
WannaCry 2.0 and Dridex
under their authority.

89
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,040
Some of which are related

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,730
to Iran and North Korean
sanctions authorities.

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
And some of which relate to
EO13694 and its revisions

92
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,088
which are refereed to
collectively as the Cyber EO.

93
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:37,090
What the advisory does
is it reminds readers

94
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,090
of that authority to bring
a civil enforcement action.

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,530
And also the factors that will
affect Treasury's judgment

96
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,630
about whether an enforcement action

97
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,890
or penalty's appropriate.

98
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,623
Including whether the American company

99
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:57,620
or entity had an risk-based
compliance program in place

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,670
designed to identify and
mitigate sanctions risks.

101
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,420
So that such payments weren't made.

102
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,760
And whether the entity or or victim

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,690
in this case, as we're talking
about context of ransomware,

104
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,730
cooperated with law
enforcement, reached out

105
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,870
to law enforcement and
was transparent with them.

106
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,510
Which is described as a
significant mitigating factor.

107
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,210
Now, if you asked OFAC,

108
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,120
they will tell you that
this guidance isn't news.

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,070
That all it does is summarize
the law that has long existed.

110
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,070
And, you know, Dridex I
think was relatively recent.

111
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,440
Some of the other sanctions
related to ransomware,

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,543
they back some years,
I think back to 2016.

113
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,659
But I think when the advisory did land,

114
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,034
when it became public, it was a bit

115
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:48,940
of an attention getting signal.

116
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,420
Because some thought it was a way

117
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,680
of targeting ransomware
victims and saying,

118
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,897
you shouldn't pay a ransom
if you have ransomware.

119
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,480
And if you do, we're gonna come get you.

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,080
If you read the advisory, though

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
the audience that it's geared towards

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,728
is not the victim of ransomware

123
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:10,405
so much as the intermediaries
that a victim might rely on

124
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:13,500
to make a ransomware
payment, or might do business

125
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,420
with them in responding to an intrusion.

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,030
And there I'm thinking of forensic firms

127
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,239
and insurance companies

128
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,340
and to some extent,
financial services firms.

129
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,000
And I think the point
of the advisory is to go

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,700
to those intermediaries,
get their attention

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,460
and ensure they have risk-based
compliance programs so that

132
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,840
if they're helping a client
deal with a ransomware incident

133
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,010
and there are indications
that a payment might benefit

134
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,060
or involve a sanctioned entity or person,

135
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,590
those intermediaries deflect the payment,

136
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,039
prevent it from taking place.

137
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,373
Now you might ask, why do this?

138
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,190
If you get hit by ransomware,

139
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,440
it's a very stressful day
for the victim, right?

140
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
It may be that they don't
have adequate backups.

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,250
That might be that the backups themselves

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,190
were compromised by the ransomware.

143
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,730
There may not be much of a choice.

144
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,270
So it doesn't this make a hard day worse

145
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,500
for that particular victim.

146
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,910
That's probably right

147
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,820
if you look at it only from
that victim's perspective.

148
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,360
But ransomware is the classic
tragedy of the commons.

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,940
Where as an individual entity, you may

150
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,440
or may not be better off paying the ransom

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,170
but all of us are worse off if you do

152
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,810
because every dollar that goes
to the ransomware operator

153
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,050
or designer expands the market for it.

154
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,130
It makes it more profitable.

155
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,363
It ensures that there'll be
more ransomware in the future.

156
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,120
And it's even worse if
it's North Korea or Iran

157
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,020
that's in the background
sponsoring the ransomware, right?

158
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,030
Because the fund don't just
further criminal goals,

159
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,219
they can be tied to nuclear
peripheration or terrorism.

160
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,010
So that I think is the policy case

161
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,840
for reminding those intermediaries,
like insurance companies

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,820
of the sanctions authority and the impact.

163
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,560
And the hope I think is
that by shrinking rewards

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,950
from ransomware payments, you
potentially shape the behavior

165
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,530
of ransomware actors
and constrain the market

166
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,179
for it in a way that benefits all of us.

167
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,013
I'll stop there.

168
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,700
- Stewart, can you give us
your take, having, you know,

169
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,020
carefully looked at the guidance.

170
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,729
I know it's not been out that long

171
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,039
and as Adam rightly pointed
out, maybe it's not new news.

172
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,929
In other words, it's kind of,

173
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,120
this was based on already authorities.

174
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,919
But what's your take looking
at the broader picture?

175
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,760
Is this useful?

176
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,260
Do you anticipate a change in the behavior

177
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,000
well of those conducting
the cyber attacks,

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,820
but more specifically,
those that are the victims

179
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,600
of the ransomware?

180
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,600
- So I think this is not new
for people who practice law

181
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,670
in front of OFAC and who do sanctions law.

182
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,949
None of the principles that were laid out

183
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,670
are at all surprising
to people who do that.

184
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,630
But it's completely new in the context

185
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,630
of ransomware payments,
where people had only begun

186
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,839
to think about this and
mainly to think about it

187
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,730
in terms of the liability of the company

188
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,670
that was the victim of the attack.

189
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,439
It's the one place where I
might disagree with Adam.

190
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,890
It's true that this is aimed

191
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,890
in substantial part at the
facilitators of payments

192
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,850
but before it was aimed
at the facilitators,

193
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,870
it was aimed at the victims of ransomware.

194
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,300
If you pay it, you are clearly subject

195
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,880
to liability under OFAC.

196
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,420
If you pay it to somebody
who's subject to sanctions.

197
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,130
What is mildly novel as a factual matter

198
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,070
is that the treasury is calling out

199
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,410
the people who negotiate these things,

200
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,170
the people who do the
forensics and say, we think

201
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,990
that this is an okay payment
or not an okay payment

202
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,428
based on the evidence from the attack.

203
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,410
The insurance companies that say, yes,

204
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,920
we'll cover you for this.

205
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,910
And maybe the financial services,

206
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,390
people who actually move the money.

207
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,727
Those folks probably had not

208
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,949
because they didn't have a
reason to understand the details

209
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,520
of OFAC, law didn't understand
that facilitating payment

210
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,270
that violates OFAC sanctions
is itself a violation

211
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,343
of the sanctions.

212
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,739
And that's clear enough
as a matter of law.

213
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,270
It probably was a surprise
to the people who do this

214
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,730
to some degree, depending on
how much legal advice they got

215
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,220
before they did this.

216
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,610
This is probably, and I
think it's worth saying

217
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,520
that there was in August,
two or three months

218
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,509
before this came out, a very notorious

219
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,740
ransomware attack on Garmin.

220
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,870
And Garmin, everyone surmises.

221
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,620
I'm not sure they've confirmed
this, paid the ransom,

222
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,620
got their data back and
not long thereafter, RTI,

223
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,569
which does forensics
announced that it had decided

224
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,080
that the particular kind
of ransomware that was used

225
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,080
to attack Garmin though they
mentioned Garmin, not at all,

226
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,830
was not necessarily evil corp,

227
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,713
which was subject to sanctions.

228
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:47,829
It was a controversial analysis

229
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,720
but it was a public analysis
on, it was widely viewed

230
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,730
as a justification for Garmin
to pay and for others to pay

231
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,730
if they were subject to
wasted hacker attacks.

232
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,730
And it's not unreasonable
to view what Treasury did

233
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,978
as an effort to make sure

234
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:14,870
that people who stepped into
this gray zone understood

235
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,410
that they were taking the risk

236
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,459
that if they were wrong,
they had violated the law.

237
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,910
The fact that they didn't know for sure

238
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,069
they were wrong doesn't matter.

239
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,540
If treasury later finds

240
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,120
that you made a payment
to somebody who's subject

241
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,010
to sanctions, all the Goodwill

242
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,980
and all the reasonable
precautions in the world

243
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,950
don't prevent you from being
held to have violated the law.

244
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,210
All they will do is reduce
the level of sanctions.

245
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,210
And the advisory gives us
a couple of practical tips

246
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,170
for ways to reduce your
likelihood of liability

247
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,949
which are also designed to say

248
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,830
don't get too cute with your attributions

249
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,440
because, we're gonna be watching.

250
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,940
And if we don't think
your did it in good faith.

251
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,470
If you didn't do it pursuant

252
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,363
to a careful compliance
plan, we're gonna hammer you.

253
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,240
- So can I, if I could
follow up with both of you

254
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,880
on that first to Stewart.

255
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,080
The list of intermediaries

256
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,810
that you discussed as potentially
being very much effected

257
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,839
by this, could you throw
in law firms in that too?

258
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,823
I mean, those that are.

259
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,750
- So they did not include
law firms and I suspect

260
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,450
that was a careful decision,
but I have advised plenty

261
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,160
of American general councils

262
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,459
or associate general councils working

263
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,280
in foreign firms that they can be subject

264
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,348
to facilitation liability

265
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,742
if they are not careful
about the advice they give.

266
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,200
There's a little more
leeway because you can give

267
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
compliance advice and not
be guilty of facilitation.

268
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,380
That may be why they left law firms out.

269
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,660
But yeah, I think law firms
that are too cute here

270
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,290
and develop a reputation for, you know,

271
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,890
good law firm to go to
if you want cute advice

272
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,992
are probably at risk.

273
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,609
- So, if I takeaway
from this, could it be,

274
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,130
and Adam answer, I'd like
to get both your views

275
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,320
but maybe Adam first on this,

276
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,913
is if I'm reading this and I'm not,

277
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,680
say I'm a victim but not a
lawyer, haven't consulted lawyers

278
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,969
but I'm reading this
guideline, the new guidelines

279
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,660
trying to understand the state of things

280
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,890
and I've been a victim.

281
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,319
Is one takeaway, is it recommended

282
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,860
that the first call is to FBI?

283
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,330
I mean, does that help?

284
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,860
Does that help a potential entity

285
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,230
that's been a victim
who wants to pay, right?

286
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,380
What benefit is there?

287
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,500
And should they call the FBI?

288
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
How does that help them?

289
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,349
- So the answer to that
question will always be yes

290
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,920
from my perspective, you should call

291
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,077
the FBI ransomware to not.

292
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,690
But it will help in this
specific context still.

293
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,610
I think if you're the victim

294
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,870
and you may hit with ransomware

295
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,730
you're probably not reading
treasury guidance that day.

296
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,670
You probably called your, if you have them

297
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,310
on retainer or you referred to someone

298
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,099
you call an incident responder,
your network's locked.

299
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
And if your IT department can't do it

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,860
you need to restore from backup

301
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,760
or you need to figure out what's going on.

302
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,740
Maybe you don't call them.

303
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,340
Maybe you try to make
the payment yourself.

304
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,910
But I think at some point,

305
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,170
you're gonna hit your insurance company,

306
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,183
a forensic firm or some other,

307
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,079
I call them an intermediary

308
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,630
or a facilitator, which
are Stewart's word.

309
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,300
They hopefully will
have read this advisory.

310
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,973
And then in the course of the
response, they will say, well,

311
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,910
this might be a Dridex variant.

312
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,372
And so we can't help
you make this payment.

313
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,590
At what point you call the FBI,

314
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,760
maybe you call them the
minute your system's locked.

315
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,069
Maybe you call them after
you called your lawyer,

316
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,653
your insurance company
and your forensic firm.

317
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,030
At that point, FBI might
be able to help you

318
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,569
understand better what variant it is.

319
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,910
They might tell you with greater clarity

320
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,730
that it's not a sanctioned variant.

321
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,950
That actually it looks different.

322
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,590
It looks like a false flag

323
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,440
or they might tell you confirm
what your, others had said

324
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,960
which is, yeah, we're not sure.

325
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,508
There are indications this is
a such and such ransomware.

326
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:37,180
And that's been designated.

327
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,510
That does make it harder for you to pay.

328
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,830
So let's take a another example

329
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,410
where no one's seen this before.

330
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,260
It's a new variant.

331
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,160
There's not a lot of information

332
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,750
out on the internet about
who's responsible for it.

333
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,590
You've called the FBI.

334
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,290
No one tells you this
is a sanctioned entity.

335
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,560
You make the payment.

336
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,680
And six months later, it turns out

337
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,363
that this was Dridex 3.0,
but you didn't know that.

338
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,210
And let's say it's public
because you're a large company.

339
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,910
So the fact you paid the
ransom, it becomes known.

340
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,819
The benefit of having
called the FBI is that,

341
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,550
if Treasury reads the newspaper

342
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,270
that you paid the ransom and they know

343
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,270
that it was happened to
be a sanctioned entity,

344
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,609
the fact you called the
FBI and involved them

345
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,859
in a certain way in your decision-making,

346
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,639
will be a significant mitigating factor.

347
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,280
And I'm not aware of any circumstance

348
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,840
where someone has done that.

349
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,939
Where we, the Justice Department have come

350
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,673
after them criminally or
Treasury has imposed a penalty.

351
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,363
I think, you know, this
is a hard, I don't know

352
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:44,770
if this is intuitive, but
I really do think the point

353
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,440
of the advisory is to get
people to design programs

354
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,020
to detach risk and did
not make the payment.

355
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,930
It really doesn't work as
a policy matter just to go

356
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,780
after people, after making the
payment, that's not the goal.

357
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,530
The goal is frankly,
to make it unpalatable

358
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,980
to you to make the payment,

359
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,640
or at least to make it
difficult for you to do so

360
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,260
because no one will help
you make the payment.

361
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,260
And I think echoing Stewart's
point, I think, you know,

362
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,120
if there were to be a firm that says,

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,600
well we're gonna turn a blind eye to this

364
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,020
and develop policies and
sort of help victims out.

365
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,600
We feel really, let's say
it's called Empathy Corp.

366
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,760
Instead of Evil Corp.

367
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
We really feel bad for ransomware victims.

368
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,010
So you can come to us and we
will tell you no matter what,

369
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,572
this is not sanctioned ransomware.

370
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:35,409
We don't see any indication of that.

371
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,300
Well, at some point, we,

372
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,530
the Justice Department will
probably catch onto this.

373
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,610
And that will take you from
being a strictly liable entity

374
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,830
to an entity that's behaving

375
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,750
with at least conscious
avoidance of the facts,

376
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,920
if not in criminal intent.

377
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,910
And that will expose that
intermediary to prosecution.

378
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,210
So I think that's the way to
think of the chain of behavior

379
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,740
we're trying to encourage is.

380
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,390
If you create policies that
will prevent the payment,

381
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,280
we're less interested in the
one or two that slipped by

382
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,180
because the compliance
program maybe, you know,

383
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,730
just doesn't catch everything.

384
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,890
But if you haven't designed that program,

385
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,430
in fact, you've done the opposite to try

386
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,040
to facilitate these
payments, then you're exposed

387
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,540
to a much more significant sanction.

388
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,290
- Yeah, I think it,
victims of a ransomware

389
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,340
are going to find that
most of the intermediaries

390
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,449
have been pretty thoroughly deterred

391
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,443
from offering close to
the line advice on this.

392
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,230
Because from their point of view,

393
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,876
what they make for one
engagement is simply not enough

394
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,340
to justify a large risk
of an investigation

395
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,786
and substantial penalties
under the OFAC regime.

396
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,400
So your insurance company is certainly

397
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,883
not gonna wanna assure you that

398
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,000
that it will cover your payments

399
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,920
if it thinks there's a risk
that it's a sanctioned entity.

400
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,730
And probably that's true for the forensics

401
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,770
and the negotiators that you might hire

402
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,770
to try to arrive at a suitable ransom.

403
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,370
So this probably is having
the effect that was intended

404
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,760
which is to make it harder

405
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,560
to make payments to people
who are reasonably believed

406
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,370
to be subject to sanctions.

407
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,703
I do think there is a question
whether that makes sense.

408
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:34,766
OFAC's rules were originally
designed to impose penalties

409
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,000
on the you know, Nazi Germany

410
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,550
while we were at war with them.

411
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,110
And the same in World War I.

412
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,340
It is a nuclear and the
penalties are enormous

413
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,580
and the structure is designed
to make sure people stay

414
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,149
well away from anybody
who's a sanctioned entity.

415
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,580
But we have begun using it
in a very fine-tuned way.

416
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,899
The US government has to be done using it

417
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,853
person by person to cut people
off from the banking systems.

418
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,570
And it has worked to some
degree in that context

419
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,873
but in this context where
people are really up against it,

420
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,980
it really does simply add to
the pain the victim suffers.

421
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,310
And I'm not sure it's
really going to affect

422
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,080
the people who are serving ransomware.

423
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,710
T`here's no indication that I've seen

424
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,697
that they are hiding their
old protocols and tools

425
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,860
and techniques in an
effort to make it easier

426
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,550
for people to decide that
this is really not Evil Corp

427
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,090
and so I can pay them.

428
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,639
If they're not even doing that,

429
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,030
then they're not really very deterred

430
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,149
by the the imposition of sanctions.

431
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,110
And the only people who are suffering

432
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,070
are the companies that are subjected

433
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,983
to a second risk of liability if they pay.

434
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,980
- So if we, coming up to Stewart,

435
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,680
if it ends up being that the effect

436
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,970
is that these intermediaries
are deterred then

437
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,220
and they're not gonna be giving any advice

438
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,330
that they might otherwise have
been given to these victims,

439
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,562
where are we leaving the victims then?

440
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,070
Those that feel that they
need to pay this ransomware.

441
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,790
They don't have backups.

442
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,899
For whatever reason they've
made the determination

443
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,710
for their own interest for their company,

444
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,600
they're gonna have to pay this ransom.

445
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,253
Will that, is that gonna deter them?

446
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,910
And I would like to see,

447
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,330
do we have any idea of
how this looks globally?

448
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,154
Are we then putting American
entities in a situation

449
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:53,310
where as you said, if the
bad guys are gonna continue

450
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,510
to conduct these attacks
and maybe look elsewhere

451
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,750
outside the United States

452
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,920
if they're not getting their money here,

453
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,310
how are we placing our American companies

454
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,530
vis-a-vis others that might not be

455
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,620
under the same restrictions

456
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,620
or Department of Treasury guidelines?

457
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,000
- If it was working, then we
would see ransomware gangs

458
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,451
avoiding American companies

459
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:24,050
or companies with substantial US assets.

460
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,379
Because they thought it was
gonna be harder to get paid.

461
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,920
And then they would pick on others.

462
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,910
And it's a variant of what we have seen.

463
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,280
I think in the area of
terrorist hostage-taking

464
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,466
where the US very hard line

465
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:41,340
until fairly recently
has made it unproductive

466
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,480
to kidnap Americans for ransom.

467
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,620
If you happen to kidnap them,

468
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,689
it's probably more likely you'll kill them

469
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,680
than you will hold them for ransom

470
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,060
because the US has been so
tough on ransom payments.

471
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,960
And that has exposed
other Western countries

472
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,630
to more kidnappings than Americans.

473
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,467
So it could work, but I don't see a sign

474
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:10,520
that it is having that
effect, which makes me think

475
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,700
that maybe these sanctions
aren't really biting

476
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,433
for the ransomware gangs.

477
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,090
- So I think it's a little, the difficulty

478
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,860
with measuring the effect of the policy

479
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,219
is it's inherently going
to involve unknown.

480
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,300
Remember that the not
all ransomware payments

481
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,230
are subject to sanctions, right?

482
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,310
It's only payments to sanctioned entities

483
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,620
of which there are four
clusters or groups.

484
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,530
So, one interesting question
is what's the impact

485
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,960
on ransomware creators

486
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,130
or operators who are not yet sanctioned

487
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,080
and do they shape their behavior
in any way, knowing that

488
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,600
if they become the worst of the worst,

489
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,649
just sort of realize the
standard for sanctions

490
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,380
under, right, a threat
to national security

491
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,220
or economic interest.

492
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,590
They get put on this list

493
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,830
and it makes it that much
harder for them to move money.

494
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,439
It makes it, it cuts
off their access a bit.

495
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,280
Do they then try to stay
below that threshold?

496
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,450
Does that mean that it's
better to be, you know,

497
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,960
When the bear is chasing you,

498
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,120
you don't have to outrun the bear.

499
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,003
You just have to outrun the
person running next to you.

500
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,060
So by that logic, are you a little better

501
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,139
being a little quiet or
a little less ambitious

502
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,110
and therefore victimizing fewer Americans

503
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,379
or focusing more on Western Europe?

504
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,180
I can't answer that, but
there's a certain logic

505
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,320
to that driving that decision calculus.

506
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
And to your question, Catherine,

507
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,879
about the victim that has to pay,

508
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,840
that feels like a compelling case

509
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,300
but frame it in terms of
paying money to Iran, right?

510
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,530
I mean, a terrorist organization.

511
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,899
Yes, it's awful.

512
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,300
If your relative or your
business is held hostage

513
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,220
by a terrorist group, but
we are all much worse off

514
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,530
if you give them the more money
to encourage this behavior

515
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,120
to the point about hostage taking.

516
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,485
So fortunately, there are ways victims

517
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:12,270
can protect themselves to some
great degree from ransomware.

518
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,090
And it's some of the
concepts Stewart mentioned

519
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,610
like backups and the like.

520
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,070
And to take Treasury's position,

521
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,700
just because you didn't take
the right steps to prevent

522
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,590
or mitigate harm to your network

523
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,500
doesn't mean the rest of
us should have to contend

524
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,883
with richer in North Korea or Iran.

525
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,899
- Thank you for your
thoughts on that, both.

526
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,220
I wanted to, it's not completely unrelated

527
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,670
but it's tangential to the guidelines.

528
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,670
I wanted to see if we could
say, or get your opinions

529
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,360
on kind of some general efforts

530
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,040
or maybe even specific efforts

531
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,780
from the government
and others with respect

532
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,030
to the release of private emails.

533
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,700
I mean, it's not necessarily ransomware

534
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,130
but I think this is an
important thing that which,

535
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,310
many some of the same
victims of ransomware

536
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,129
would be very concerned
about emails being released

537
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,210
out there and what the
government, DOJ, FBI, or others

538
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,210
could do maybe to assist
these individuals in this.

539
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,630
I'd love to hear from both of you.

540
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,750
Maybe Adam, you can
start with a perspective

541
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,140
from what the government might
be able to do and Stewart,

542
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,420
maybe some views of how
effective this could be

543
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,653
and useful it might be.

544
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,499
- Sure, happy to.

545
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,970
And it's a logical segue from this

546
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,593
because as you probably know,

547
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:39,810
ransomware operators are
now turning to extortion.

548
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,300
If the victims say
we're not gonna pay you,

549
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,763
I have backups, whatever.

550
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,970
The next move might be
to say, well, great.

551
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,730
You have the emails, but so
do I and I can release them.

552
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,660
And what do you think about that?

553
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,260
So you're seeing a blending
from ransomware into extortion.

554
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,970
This isn't new, right?

555
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,730
The first time I saw
this was in the attack

556
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,110
on Sony Pictures Entertainment

557
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,100
in I think it was about
2014 where in addition

558
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,100
to breaking the company's
network, the actors,

559
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,750
(indistinct) in this case,

560
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,590
did dump a lot of the material

561
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,020
on the web at various
locations around the world.

562
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,940
One of the benefits of
working with the FBI

563
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,110
and the Justice Department is our network

564
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,520
of contacts with law
enforcement around the world.

565
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,370
And so while a lot of that data,

566
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,260
most of it wasn't hosted here,

567
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,670
it was hosted on systems around the world.

568
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,020
We were able to reach out
through law enforcement

569
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,879
liaison relationships
and ask the authorities

570
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,700
in those countries to
use whatever authority

571
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,590
they have to try to mitigate that.

572
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,939
And here, if it's hosted here.

573
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,420
Although you tend not to
see that quite as much,

574
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,900
we would go to the providers,

575
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,860
alert them to what they're doing.

576
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,350
And in the case of a sanctioned entity,

577
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,290
if you're providing server space

578
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,420
to North Korea or Iran here,

579
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,740
and we tell you that's what you're doing

580
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,810
and you don't stop the transaction,

581
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,330
you don't stop providing that.

582
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,710
You then become potentially
exposed to a penalty,

583
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,690
under the same authority.

584
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,130
'Cause you're, imagine
the ransomware operator,

585
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,380
that's also leased
DCLeaks site here, right?

586
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,570
That you're doing business with them.

587
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,310
So that is one way the
government can also help

588
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,001
mitigate the harm to the company

589
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,090
(crackling drowns out speaker)

590
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,040
once it's on the internet,
it's on the internet.

591
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,670
But you know, there's a difference between

592
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,440
how widely accessible
difference and impacts

593
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,990
depending on how widely
accessible the material is.

594
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,778
So that's another reason
to call the FBI, I think,

595
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:48,380
is that we can be helpful in that respect.

596
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,550
- Stewart, so do we have a
silver lining in calling the FBI?

597
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,830
I mean, do we see some advantages?

598
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,835
- So there is clearly,

599
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,760
that the treasury has
made it absolutely clear.

600
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,980
You bring in law enforcement,
doesn't have to be the FBI.

601
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,070
It could be the Secret Service.

602
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,950
It could be ICE.

603
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,750
It could be, it could probably
be local law enforcement.

604
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:10,972
And you make a full disclosure,
a timely disclosure to them.

605
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,020
Interestingly, they did not ask
that you ask law enforcement

606
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,430
whether it's okay to pay.

607
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,070
So you might be able to
tell them I'm gonna pay.

608
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,520
I wanted to bring you in
and tell you all this stuff

609
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,360
because it's part of my
compliance plan, but I'm paying.

610
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,659
So that's a possibility.

611
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,052
Getting back to the doxing,

612
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:35,570
the hacking and releasing of data.

613
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,610
I think there are options to consider.

614
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,570
Ever since it, frankly
an operation like that

615
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,733
cost Hillary Clinton the presidency.

616
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,649
Silicon Valley has been
much less enthusiastic

617
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:53,129
about WikiLeaks and Julian
Assange and the like.

618
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,440
And they probably would be open

619
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,440
to refusing to allow the
distribution of hacked materials.

620
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,610
Some of the companies say it's a violation

621
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,909
of their terms of service.

622
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,820
And one thing I've often
wanted to try is nobody carries

623
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,430
if they can avoid it,
copyrighted materials.

624
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,920
It turns out that all of our emails

625
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,290
are copyrighted as we write them.

626
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,460
And so if you were to find
a way to register copyright

627
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,390
for at least some of the
emails that might end up

628
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,030
being released, you'd have
very powerful sanctions

629
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,067
on secondary distribution
of those documents.

630
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,440
It's probably worth considering.

631
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,370
If you think you're a
likely to be a target.

632
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,389
Although I will confess, this
is an idea that has occurred

633
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,630
to me as we were speaking.

634
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,660
So there may be a legal problem with it,

635
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,010
but it's worth considering.

636
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,142
- Problematic emails are
probably not the ones

637
00:31:57,142 --> 00:32:00,990
that are gonna rush the copyright,
but I think reaching back

638
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,530
20 years, the copyright rights,

639
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,700
that's as you fix it in a tangible form.

640
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,077
So I don't know that you
have to actually register it

641
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,440
to have some of the protections

642
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,273
- That's right.

643
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:15,049
It is already copyrighted,
but to get the benefit

644
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,700
of the hammer of $250,000
for every publication,

645
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,280
you need to have registered
it and you don't have

646
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,363
to register your scary ones.

647
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,800
No one is gonna go through

648
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,310
and only release the scary ones.

649
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,899
They're just gonna dump the whole thing.

650
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,623
And you just say, as long as I
have a few canaries in there,

651
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:38,040
I can announce that the whole
coal mine is going down.

652
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,113
It may be enough.

653
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,233
- This is why you get paid
the big bucks, Stewart.

654
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:46,610
- So that's something new, actually.

655
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,689
That's a good takeaway.

656
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,000
And I think that we've given some,

657
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,330
potentially many people in the audience

658
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,906
some food for thought,
they may be calling their,

659
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:59,399
or asking their in-house counsel
about copywriting emails.

660
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,030
I think I myself would
consider that, especially

661
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,320
if I was a CEO of a company,
I might think about that.

662
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,850
I think we're coming up
close to our time limit

663
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,439
but I wanted to ask both of
you for any concluding comments

664
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,840
or advice that you wanted to share.

665
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,720
Anything you wanted to
highlight or emphasize

666
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,053
or take away for folks to
remember from the session?

667
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,560
- No, I'll just say

668
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,690
that I think a common theme
is that you're better off

669
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,907
calling law enforcement
and working with us.

670
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:31,320
I mean, there's a temptation
to avoid being pregnant

671
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,490
with knowledge, but the system
isn't built to reward that.

672
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,490
And even if you think paying
the ransom is your only option,

673
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,649
it could leave you less
secure in the future

674
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,830
because there's no
guarantee that that actor

675
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,000
is gonna pull every tool
they have off your network.

676
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,405
If you pay once, why
wouldn't you pay again?

677
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,993
You're vulnerable to be
exploited a second time.

678
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,129
- And Stewart?

679
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,564
- So, the OFAC sanctions
are a nuclear weapon

680
00:33:57,564 --> 00:34:00,480
and you don't use those to get rid

681
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,070
of the cockroaches in your home.

682
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,810
And that's the worry here.

683
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,360
I would say if there's a
lesson here for business,

684
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,230
it's that we shouldn't be applauding

685
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,219
when the treasury announces
that they are imposing sanctions

686
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,060
on another ransomware entity,
unless we know it works

687
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,799
'cause if they impose the
sanctions and it doesn't work,

688
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,590
it's really just imposing sanctions

689
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,770
on the businesses that are victims.

690
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,570
And we need to be much
more careful about that.

691
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,091
- So before we wrap up, to the point

692
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:36,060
of when will we know we
know what it will look like

693
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,610
if it's working, I think Stewart,

694
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,159
you've kinda outlined
that Adam, you did too.

695
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,853
How long will this take?

696
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,219
It's a big hypothetical.

697
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,639
We know ransomware is
probably not going to,

698
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,859
in the near future, doesn't look like,

699
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,300
doesn't look like they're slowing down.

700
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,760
But will this take a year
before we can come back

701
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
and say, oh, these guidelines
look like they're working

702
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,500
or is this a longer term,
do we have to wait longer

703
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,902
in which to get a good
assessment of effectiveness

704
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:04,103
do you think?

705
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,680
- I think in terms of
discouraging payments

706
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,279
I think we agree it's working.

707
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,150
So that by that measure,
it is a success, right?

708
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,370
We think it's already slowing

709
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,420
or stopping payments
to designated entities.

710
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,220
If your measure is is it
working in bankrupting

711
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,620
the ransomware operators?

712
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,683
No.

713
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,070
And I don't know that
we will ever know that.

714
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,903
We'll never know how much
more they would have made.

715
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:31,823
We won't ever know what the other

716
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:34,900
unsanctioned operators
are doing differently.

717
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,960
So I think it sets up a burden

718
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,270
you can't carry if you frame it that way.

719
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,930
But if you think about kidnapping

720
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,299
by terrorist groups or the like,

721
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,680
we all agree it's better that
they don't have resources.

722
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,129
And so if we agree that
discouraging the payment

723
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,900
of resources makes them,
just give them less access

724
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,710
to ransomware, we know they're not getting

725
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,443
an extra 250 Bitcoin or 1,000
Bitcoin, then it's working.

726
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,933
- So I don't think this is
going to work by itself ever.

727
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,350
we are going to have to
find other ways to sanction

728
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,113
and impose difficulties
on ransomware gangs.

729
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,879
Maybe, it's clearly
cryptocurrency that has made this

730
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,149
an easily reward for ransomware gangs

731
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,700
and finding ways to track
and discourage illicit use

732
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,830
of cryptocurrency is really critical.

733
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,650
And then finding other ways
to discourage the havens

734
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,673
for the ransomware.

735
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:44,670
Maybe we could persuade Vladimir Putin

736
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,230
that he's been the victim of Dridex

737
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,927
that Gang will find no
as a refuge in Russia.

738
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,563
But we're gonna have to
continue to work on this.

739
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,550
This is a feel good solution
for the US government

740
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,570
rather than a real
solution to the problem.

741
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,910
- So maybe step number
one, but it does sound

742
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,589
like what a Stewart, at least
what you're calling for.

743
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,240
And I don't think Adam would be opposed

744
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,129
to more creative thinking
that we probably do have to.

745
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,310
It's not only treasury departments

746
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,850
or even law enforcement role

747
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,940
but maybe even broader thinking
about what else can be done.

748
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,210
So with that, maybe we wrap it up

749
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,825
and we might have to be back on this topic

750
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,049
to discuss what progress we're seeing

751
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,630
or more creative ways to tackle the issue.

752
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,610
But I wanna thank you very much

753
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,753
Adam and Stewart for taking the time.
