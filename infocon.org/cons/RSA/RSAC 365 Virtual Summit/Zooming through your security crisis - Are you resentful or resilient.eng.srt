1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,036
(clock ticking)

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,870
- Well, hi, thank you so
much for joining me today

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,810
and I really thank RSA Conference

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,709
for giving me an opportunity to present.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,200
For those of you that
attended RSA Conference 2020,

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,860
this presentation was really built

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,380
out of the human element talk that I gave

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,810
regarding deception and detox
amongst security leaders.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,520
You know, I know that many
of us, especially myself

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,210
are really burned out
on virtual presentations

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,310
which is kind of ironic
because that's really

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,730
what I'm gonna be chatting about today.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,019
And so I would encourage each
of us to just really pause

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,470
for a few moments and
challenge ourselves to answer

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,653
kind of some of the questions
that I'll be posing to you.

16
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:05,150
Now just like you create
a security roadmap

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,090
for your company, you might
create an incident response plan

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,700
for the team you're on or
a business continuity plan.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,410
I always like to have a
roadmap of the presentation

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,880
to let you know where we're going,

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,619
chat a little bit about
the background of politics

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,270
and a crisis and what it
is, and then really move

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,140
into the meat talking about resilience

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,900
and then giving us all some next steps

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,873
kind of an action plan to move forward.

26
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,970
So I wanna start by just
getting this out of the way,

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,750
2020 was certainly a very political year

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,660
with social unrest and
massive economic impacts,

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,810
some of which of course
are still going on.

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,310
My goal is not to talk about this at all,

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,800
my presentation style is
really just to ask questions

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,203
and to encourage us.

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,120
But what I will say is that
I'm not shy to talk about

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,570
and discuss politics,
but I prefer to do it

35
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,122
in a one-on-one format, kind of in person.

36
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,140
I really tend to keep my political beliefs

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,820
and views to myself because I don't think

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,053
they should impact my job or my team.

39
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,049
It's still in order to
keep this non-political,

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,470
I really wanna focus on the core topic

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,150
of crisis management and
resilience during any time,

42
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,250
not just kind of what's
been going on in our world

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,243
the past year.

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,079
Now don't get me wrong, we
can't bury our head in the sand

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,290
and ignore politics, we
certainly always will have state

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,530
and national politics and of
course, office place politics.

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,150
And we have to acknowledge that

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,340
and we have to know how
to manage and balance it.

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,080
And so I believe good
leaders understand what

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,500
this balance is and I would
hope that if you would ask

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,380
any of my team members kind
of where I stand on issues

52
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,023
outside of the office, they
probably wouldn't know.

53
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,260
But if you ask them about issues
that are impacting our team

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,130
inside the company, they would tell you

55
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,632
I'm definitely quick to
stand up and discuss those.

56
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay, so now that we've
got that out of the way,

57
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,483
let's begin.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,230
So first I'm not one to typically do

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,769
like themed presentations,
but I just thought

60
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,200
with everything that's been
going on we can all just look

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,769
at Dr. Seuss and we're all
familiar with Dr. Seuss

62
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,637
and that will help us along
in some of our encouragement.

63
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:33,430
And so I do sincerely hope
that you and your teams

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,900
are really doing well.

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,640
I hope your family is safe and
that you're making the best

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,630
out of our current situation.

67
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,200
You know, I hope you're
spending more quality time

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,630
with family, that you're
investing in some hobbies

69
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,620
that you didn't have time to in the past

70
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,950
and that you're looking
forward to new opportunities

71
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,732
and innovations that
can come from a crisis.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,590
And while it's usually not our
natural inclination to think

73
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,690
about the good from every situation

74
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,840
I hope to encourage you
to start doing just that.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,340
I mean, truly if Dr. Seuss
can do it, so can you.

76
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,460
And I personally don't
do this enough myself,

77
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,010
so I'm speaking to myself
as well during this time.

78
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,380
So what is a crisis?

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,329
You know, I think it's
important that we remember

80
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,950
that this can be personal
or specific to a team

81
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,820
or a department or an entire company.

82
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,310
And so when we look at
Wikipedia or you think

83
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,510
about what is a crisis, it's
any event really that leads

84
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,060
to an unstable and dangerous situation

85
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,863
and it can have an impact
on various sizes of groups.

86
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,860
And there's really three
different types of crises.

87
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,360
One is in an immediate
crisis, and those are those

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,230
that are the natural disasters and things

89
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,120
that really can't be predicted.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,550
I mean, we can have plans
in place to handle them

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,200
but we won't be able to prevent them.

92
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,750
So certainly things like tornadoes

93
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,653
and floods and hurricanes.

94
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,349
And then there's those
crisis that are emerging

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,070
and these are things
that can be anticipated

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,980
and some of them can
even then be prevented.

97
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,400
So things like, if you've
got an issue brewing

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,140
that, you know about at the
organization you're hearing talk

99
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,380
bubble up from different groups of people

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,900
that could really disrupt operations

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,799
or affect your reputation.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,700
Think about if you're in
manufacturing and you've got

103
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,690
a bunch of safety violations
that you know are going on

104
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,240
and that maybe you know
need to be addressed

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,210
or aren't being addressed.

106
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,229
Or you've got ethically
questionable actions

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,913
or you got employee dissatisfaction
with wages and benefits.

108
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,900
You can have time to research and plan

109
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,750
and hopefully proactively
eliminate those from happening.

110
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,830
And then you've got the sustained crisis.

111
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,140
And of course this is
the most dangerous of all

112
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,340
because it can linger on

113
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,320
and it can really drain the organization.

114
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,110
So things like you could have continued

115
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,130
negative news coverage,
rumors about an organization

116
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,620
which often stem from an immediate crisis.

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,800
Think about maybe an
oil spill in the water

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,620
in the Gulf of Mexico or something

119
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,423
or repeated recalls by an automaker.

120
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,330
These can cause lasting
reputational damage

121
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,479
and I'm not sure I would put
a data breach in this category

122
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,610
because while it can go on for years

123
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,200
with litigations and fines,
I think most of us forget

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,880
about them within just
a few days or weeks,

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,743
but some might put a data breach
in the sustained category.

126
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,050
So how can we prepare
and respond to a crisis?

127
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,800
I mean we can create a plan for resilience

128
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,597
or we can get upset and be resentful.

129
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:57,496
And so that's really what we're
gonna watch out about now.

130
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,513
So going back to Wikipedia for
a definition of resilience,

131
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:07,530
it's really any of our ability to adapt

132
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,159
in the face of adverse conditions.

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,750
And so that's from the
personal standpoint,

134
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,680
but from a technology standpoint,

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,710
it's the ability of our
systems, or our applications

136
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,900
to withstand changes in its environment

137
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,299
and actually still function.

138
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,010
And if you, you know SC
Magazine did an interview

139
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,180
with Tom Patterson,
who's the CTO for Unisys

140
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,710
and he reminds us that
if we're always focused

141
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,700
from a security mindset,
that we have to win

142
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,390
whatever our definition
of win is, we can't

143
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,580
but if we aim for resilience,
we actually really can win.

144
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,580
And it just encourages us
that we can take a punch

145
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,420
and keep going, we really can,
and we've all taken a punch

146
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,610
in some form this past
year, even if the industry

147
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,020
you're in is having their best year ever

148
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,669
and I've heard some
have, they've really had

149
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,070
a phenomenal year with results,

150
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,640
we've all been impacted personally.

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,973
So let's dig into that a bit right now.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,700
You know one of the things
I appreciate the most

153
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,330
when I attend conferences
is attending sessions

154
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,520
that may not necessarily present
anything earth shattering

155
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,580
but present something that is so basic

156
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,090
that I may not have thought
of it in the current context

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,447
or the place of life that I'm really in.

158
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:32,169
And this is really one of those slides.

159
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,059
I think we all know that
social isolation and loneliness

160
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,089
are linked to poor mental
and physical health,

161
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,150
but we can just look
at some of these stats

162
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,650
and I know, you know, statistics, right?

163
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,709
You can find kind of
statistics that back up

164
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,800
any viewpoint you have and so
I try to look for, you know,

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,770
kind of independent
studies or family studies

166
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,603
or different things.

167
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:54,140
And this is from I think
the Kaiser Family Foundation

168
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,370
talking about if you at
numbers from last year

169
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,610
and that 47% of the
individuals that were a part

170
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,280
of this study reported some
negative mental health effects.

171
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,680
And it really is linked
to that social isolation

172
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,840
and it differs based on our age groups.

173
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,900
And so we have some
families and households

174
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,420
that have adolescents and children

175
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,439
and so we had different
concerns with homeschooling

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,840
and the cancel culture and
sporting events and such

177
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,070
and the impact that had on kids.

178
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,380
And then we have the other
spectrum with older adults

179
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,570
maybe in assisted living,
or maybe having parents

180
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,350
in assisted living, and
you're not able to reach out

181
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,950
and visit them and that has
a massive impact on them.

182
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,560
And then also on you or on the caregivers

183
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,670
which certainly has the increase

184
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,110
in substance abuse and suicide.

185
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,520
And so that's certainly
something that has increased

186
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,699
in the last year.

187
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,700
If you look at statistics
and studies that were done

188
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,930
before March of 2020, you
know, it shows that one

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,020
in five adults reported
some sort of mental illness

190
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,130
which was already up
from 17 million in 2018

191
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,870
and having the about six
or so per 100,000 deaths

192
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,480
from drug overdose and about
48,000 suicides in 2018.

193
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,793
If you look at contrast that
with after COVID started,

194
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,160
the rates just really it
was one in three adults,

195
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,839
reported symptoms of
anxiety and depression

196
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,810
compared to one in 10, the year prior.

197
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,339
So certainly the cancel
culture, virtual fatigue,

198
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,763
online school homeschooling
caused a lot of that.

199
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,140
You know, just from a
personal sharing aspect

200
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,340
I only know of one person,
I guess in my entire circle

201
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,340
of family and friends online
or in person that had COVID.

202
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,580
And unfortunately, I know two
people who attempted suicide

203
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,640
and one was successful and
the other was thankfully saved

204
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,810
by her parents.

205
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,670
The one who is no longer
with us was fully employed,

206
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,170
did not lose his job, was
in a higher level position

207
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,660
in a company, so from the outside
no one suspected anything,

208
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,530
but again we are just made to be together,

209
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,453
isolation is not healthy for anyone.

210
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,320
So have you checked in on your team?

211
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,960
I mean, virtual is
great, but have you asked

212
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,480
if they would be comfortable
maybe going in person

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,810
and having a cup of coffee?

214
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,650
I mean, you could
literally save their life

215
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,490
and not even know it.

216
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,110
In fact, I was very thankful
for one of the third parties

217
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,750
that we do business with this year,

218
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,200
last year actually hosted,

219
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,920
they have their user group meetings

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,099
and they continue to host them in person.

221
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,480
They took precautions,
they had social distancing,

222
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,310
they served all the meals outside

223
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,120
and this was back in September.

224
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,030
And I think around 200 people showed up

225
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,020
and I was certain to let
their CEO know after the event

226
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,380
that I said I don't wanna
be extreme, but I said,

227
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,140
you likely saved I bet at
least one person's life

228
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,710
by having this conference.

229
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,330
And in addition, many of
the hotel staff thanked us

230
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,070
over and over because they
hadn't been paid in many months.

231
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,180
And so I just encourage
companies to continue

232
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,020
to really do this, to ask
their employees and of course,

233
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,410
you're never gonna make everyone happy

234
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,730
but to really ask and
survey your employees

235
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,999
and/or your customers for their opinions

236
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,060
and if they would feel comfortable
meeting again in person

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,030
making those decisions.

238
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,730
It's hard, it's certainly not easy.

239
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,550
We did that with our local ISS chapter

240
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,130
in middle Tennessee and
the unanimous vote was yes

241
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,990
as long as we could meet outdoors.

242
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,960
Well, obviously that's
a little challenging

243
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,340
for us right now with the
cool weather, but it's a start

244
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,623
and so I just encourage
you to ask those questions.

245
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,320
So how can we lead through a crisis?

246
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,370
And again, these are
leadership tips that should

247
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,600
that will work no matter
what situation you're in,

248
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,680
so you don't have to be in
a crisis for these to work.

249
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,510
The first one is self care

250
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,280
and I'm not a big self-care person,

251
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm not one to go down and
buy the self-care books

252
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,959
or anything like that
but as I've done more

253
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,110
and more research and just
lived out more of life

254
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,970
and been working in security
now for over 15 years,

255
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,290
I think this is very important.

256
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,510
And that's just the
basics of getting sleep,

257
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,870
getting enough sleep every night.

258
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,870
So seven to eight hours of
sleep, it's really important,

259
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,830
putting down, having some
time away from the screen,

260
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,140
exercising regularly whatever
that looks like for you

261
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,780
and really spending time
with your friends and family.

262
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,890
You know, the exercise, there's so many

263
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,689
free exercise programs,
YouTube 10 minutes a day,

264
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,470
20 minutes a day, sure you
can buy an electronic bike

265
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,700
or something and have some accountability.

266
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,550
Sure you can still find a gym to join,

267
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,160
maybe with some limitations
but there's so many ways

268
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,860
that you can exercise in
your home, resistance bands,

269
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,430
all kinds of different things
and really help sleep better

270
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,439
and just be more productive,

271
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,490
it really helps you think better as well.

272
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,310
Second is really relying on your team.

273
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,030
You know, in challenging times,
people really will step up

274
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,260
if we let them, but if we
really, if we try to solve

275
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,750
the world's problems on
our own, well our team

276
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,320
can really only stand back and watch.

277
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,640
And so it's up to us as
leaders to bring our teams

278
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,660
into the discussions and the planning

279
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,350
and the strategizing that we do.

280
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,140
And I think you'll really see how quickly

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,810
your valuable team members
will step up and show you

282
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,599
what they're capable of.

283
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,110
You know I've had privilege to
lead many teams in my career

284
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,380
and I do remember a few team
members who didn't appear

285
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,773
to be very strong when I joined the team,

286
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,660
I mean, they were checking
the boxes each day

287
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,520
but they weren't really
going above and beyond

288
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,020
with all the tasks that
I would think they should

289
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,000
in their role but, and
so after a few months,

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,430
I did mentoring, I did
coaching and I realized

291
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,870
that for one of them it was because

292
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,700
they had been beaten down by prior leaders

293
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,500
who would micromanage and go get on them

294
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,920
if they did anything outside the box.

295
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,670
You know, if they did anything
that they weren't supposed

296
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,560
to or assigned to, they
kind of got in trouble.

297
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,530
And so I agree, this
can kind of go both ways

298
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,800
in terms of responsibility and
accountability, but I'll say

299
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,680
that once I made sure these
team members really understood

300
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,770
that I welcomed their
creativity, they really quickly

301
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,100
became invaluable and in fact,

302
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,950
a couple of them received promotions.

303
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,220
The next leadership tip would
be planning and preparation.

304
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,550
And again, it's one of those
things it's we all know,

305
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,939
but you know we've had a
number of cases this year

306
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,320
where a partner maybe a
third-party reached out

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,180
and thought one of our systems was hacked,

308
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,079
but due to our planning and
run books and different things

309
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,730
we were able to quickly prove them wrong.

310
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,510
But without these in place
it can be a distraction.

311
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,560
It can take hours to find
a simple piece of evidence

312
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,959
or a single log or something
you're looking for.

313
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,930
And I think we all know
especially when it comes

314
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,969
to like shopping, but some
of the worst decisions

315
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,040
we can make both business and personal

316
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,530
are made when emotions
direct the outcome, right?

317
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,370
So if we've done planning and
preparation ahead of a crisis,

318
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,510
that's one of the most important things

319
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,973
we can do as a leader.

320
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,510
And some of the best ways to
do this are just brainstorming.

321
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,360
Brainstorming actionable strategies

322
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
with our leadership team,
walking through a number

323
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,860
of what if scenarios that can
kind of be rapidly executed

324
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,940
at a moment's notice.

325
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,090
It really helps our team, it
helps us to make decisions

326
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,110
based on facts rather than emotion

327
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,310
and it prevents us from really
making knee jerk reactions

328
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,480
without sufficiently kind of understanding

329
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,840
and considering the impact that can have

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,423
on the entire organization.

331
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,180
So here's a question I'm
sure has been posed to you

332
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,869
by your board or by your
leadership team, by your boss.

333
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,693
If ransomware were to
hit your company today,

334
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,780
what would be your very first task?

335
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,483
What would you do besides scream or yell?

336
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,849
Who would you call, how would you stop it?

337
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,270
I mean, just some real basic questions

338
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,830
and they really aren't meant
to just get us thinking

339
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,409
because it's gonna happen,
ransomware is so prevalent.

340
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,693
So if it hits your business
today, what would you do?

341
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
Just think about that,
if you don't have a plan

342
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
or a runback for it.

343
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,518
The next item is communication.

344
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:45,940
You know, communication is critical

345
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,830
but it can also really
be our Achilles heel.

346
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,270
We have to never assume that
our teams and our clients

347
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,370
just automatically know how to succeed

348
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,129
that just doesn't happen on its own.

349
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,530
So we have to communicate
information clearly and honestly

350
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,780
so that others don't have
to really kind of guess.

351
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,730
And you know, what happens
when our team members

352
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,710
or customers or something have to guess

353
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,810
about what we're saying,
is that they can possibly

354
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,220
fill that information with
inaccurate information.

355
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,760
And that's how rumors and
different things start

356
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,920
and so we need to make
sure that when people

357
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,500
are feeling stress and anxiety,
it's especially important

358
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,733
to share information very
clearly from the beginning.

359
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,230
I've managed teams where there
are two very strong leaders

360
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,350
and they're both extremely
passionate about their work,

361
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,350
so they're invaluable.

362
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,800
However, they just can't
get along with each other.

363
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,580
They both think their
work is more important

364
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,360
than each other, so coaching
these types of personalities

365
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,500
really takes a lot of work
and thoughtful communication.

366
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,780
You know, helping explain
the value of their work

367
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,760
without putting one down to the other,

368
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,370
that's kind of crucial.

369
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,300
We all have different
roles and it's important

370
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,360
that each team member
understands where they fit

371
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,193
in the puzzle.

372
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,342
Number five is personal ideals.

373
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,560
You know, employees often
leave their personal beliefs

374
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,770
and ideas out of the workplace

375
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,250
for fear of crossing professional lines.

376
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,620
It's kind of what I talked
about at the beginning

377
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,750
with politics, but if
your personal practices

378
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,800
and your principles help you
stay healthy and organized

379
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,290
and composed, when you're
in stressful situations

380
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,290
sometimes even motivated,
then you need to bring those

381
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,030
with you, those part of
you, they're critical

382
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,730
to who you are.

383
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,370
Because if you don't, that
can limit your ability

384
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,830
to lead effectively.

385
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,040
So you should lean into those values

386
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,800
and engage with others who share them.

387
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Don't just dismiss your
personal ideals and standards

388
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,683
especially when you're
in the face of a crisis.

389
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,639
So do you have a practice that you use

390
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,600
when you get stressed, if
it's at work or at home

391
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,830
do you take a quick walk
around your building?

392
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,780
Do you go for coffee in the break room?

393
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,379
Do you have certain breathing
exercises that you do?

394
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,760
If those help, then you
should certainly use them,

395
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,960
not just at home, but
also in the workplace.

396
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,210
Six is getting to know others better.

397
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,820
You know, even when things are going well,

398
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,530
I speak for myself, I
don't always take the time

399
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,460
to get to know each other,
to know my teammates well,

400
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,100
to know my peers because
different personalities

401
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,620
and work styles can clash
especially in stressful

402
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,739
and uncertain situations.

403
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,080
It's so vital and important
to make these connections.

404
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,260
The best leaders take
responsibility for meeting people

405
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,510
where they are and they try
to communicate with them

406
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,893
in ways they understand.

407
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,390
That means understanding
different work styles,

408
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,063
preferences and attitudes.

409
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,080
You know, people will tell
me I tend to get along

410
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,230
with anyone and when I start a new job

411
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,590
I frequently have team
members who tell me,

412
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,720
you're not gonna to be able
to get along with so-and-so

413
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,740
and this person has this
quirk and this and that.

414
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,820
I remember one company
where one of my peers

415
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,790
would come over daily
and he would sit down

416
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,720
and just vent about security
and how we just always

417
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,743
cause problems with the business,

418
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,270
but I didn't let him get the best of me.

419
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,100
I just listened and then I asked him

420
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,362
how he suggested we change.

421
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,560
And he and I were able
to work together well

422
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,363
and he eventually became an ally.

423
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,572
Not the easiest relationship,
but it helped me in the end.

424
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,440
Now, if only I could apply that
to my kids when I'm at home,

425
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,753
that's another struggle.

426
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,490
The seventh tip is using external experts.

427
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,590
Too many business leaders,
I think when I say myself

428
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,280
specifically fail to
utilize external experts

429
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,572
in peer groups sometimes.

430
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,860
(clears throat)

431
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,610
Over the years I've sought
advice from outside experts,

432
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,360
hired people with different skill sets

433
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,030
and tapped peer groups
and their business leaders

434
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,060
for their expertise because
there are peer groups

435
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,100
for every industry.

436
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,530
And in joining one, I
mean, you're kind of,

437
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,300
you're in an RSA kind of peer group

438
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,570
and those are certainly available as well

439
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,389
through the 360 Conferences,
there's ISSA there's, ISACA

440
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,580
there's ISC Squared InfraGard.

441
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,669
They all offer tremendous
benefits and enhanced leadership

442
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,290
and management skills,
strategies for growth

443
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,223
and advice for attracting talent.

444
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,130
So I'd encourage you not
to say as guys, especially

445
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,410
we don't wanna ask for
help, we don't wanna ask

446
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,500
for directions before GPS,
it's great to reach out

447
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,240
and ask our peers and to
get in these peer groups,

448
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,090
because why reinvent the wheel?

449
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,530
Our peers have gone through the same kind

450
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,540
of leadership challenges,
talent challenges,

451
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,070
security challenges
that we're going through

452
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,070
ask them for help and see what they did.

453
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,240
Number eight is studying the
facts and being transparent.

454
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,290
You know, people do trust
leaders who are honest

455
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,470
and they quickly lose
faith if they don't trust

456
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,970
the information they're given.

457
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,040
And so people trust leaders who are honest

458
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,210
and they will quickly lose
faith if they don't trust

459
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,280
the information they're
given, it's just critical

460
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,233
to learn the truth and be
transparent in sharing it.

461
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,030
I know a lot of times we are
tempted to protect people

462
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,730
by withholding information or sharing

463
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,420
only part of what we know.

464
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,000
And sometimes because we're a leader

465
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
and we know certain things
are fixing to happen

466
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,100
with the company, we
can't share everything

467
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,040
but people really are
in search of the truth.

468
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,649
And so, however transparent we can be,

469
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,540
is certainly going to
help us, to help our team

470
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,223
to wanna be better
followers and to trust us.

471
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,723
And the next item is
really rewarding your team.

472
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,220
You know, as you navigate a crisis

473
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,430
maybe you say the pandemic,
leaders and employees

474
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,920
will need to make sacrifices
and have made many sacrifices

475
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,310
to ensure business continuity.

476
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,120
Many of us have been working longer hours,

477
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,500
many have taken pay
cuts, they're doing tasks

478
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,240
that are kind of outside
their everyday job

479
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,990
to fill in for the folks that
have had to be furloughed

480
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,853
or laid off.

481
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,700
So you and your teams
have likely been asked

482
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,950
to do more with less.

483
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,210
And so it's important that
we incentivize and reward

484
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,210
those on our team, however
we know that they best enjoy.

485
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,810
So certainly there's gift
cards, there's dog sitting

486
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,520
if they wanna be able to go
out and take a trip we can,

487
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,860
I've heard of some companies
doing corporate Airbnb rentals

488
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,939
where they're sending some
of their employees off

489
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,970
for a long weekend things
that maybe they can't afford

490
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,190
right now and anything that
can kind of help reward

491
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,760
and recognize all the work
that your team has done

492
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,483
to keep your business
operating in a crisis.

493
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,600
The last item is, how do
you stay positive, right?

494
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,189
How do we always look forward?

495
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,040
And what do you do, what
do you do to keep focused?

496
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,690
How do you motivate others
if you're not motivated?

497
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,620
So even if you don't want to be motivated

498
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,699
when you wake up in the
morning or when you go in

499
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,590
or when you join that virtual
meeting, don't be fake

500
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,370
on your video calls and make
others think you're fine.

501
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,120
Let them know, hey, when
you start the meeting,

502
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,989
let them know if you've
had a challenging day

503
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,780
or a challenging evening
or your morning's already

504
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,720
been very challenging and
they're going to respect

505
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,280
you a lot more and I think
they're really gonna respect you.

506
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,030
You're not gonna look weak by
sharing that you're being real

507
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,003
with your team.

508
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,520
So now we've just chatted
about, a little bit

509
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,629
about the background,
the inevitable politics

510
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,260
that we all have, we all
face every day in the world

511
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,550
and in our jobs, crises when they happen

512
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,060
from all different types
of crises that occur

513
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,950
and then how we can be great leaders

514
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,997
in a crisis and really any time.

515
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,833
And so what are some next steps?

516
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,150
Well, we talked about ransomware earlier.

517
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,800
Ransomware it really has evolved

518
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,139
into a multi-billion dollar industry.

519
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,810
And I think a lot of
victims really quietly

520
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,870
pay their attackers
without ever us knowing

521
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,649
or the authorities or the press knowing

522
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,220
because they're embarrassed maybe.

523
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,457
And so if you do follow the
money, you know, the Bitcoins,

524
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,920
the cryptocurrency of where
those ransoms are being paid

525
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,640
you will see that it goes to finance

526
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,660
usually illegal narcotics,
weapons, terrorism,

527
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,760
human trafficking, and child exploitation.

528
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,120
And so by building these resilience plans,

529
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,500
we can actually serve a greater purpose

530
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,080
than just protecting our companies.

531
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,610
It actually makes the world a safer place

532
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,199
because it curves the
funding of evil, right?

533
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,450
So when organizations
can say no to a ransom

534
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,783
and blackmail demands,
we really are all safer.

535
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,380
And I'm sure that that most of you heard

536
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,200
that the U.S. Department of Treasury

537
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,050
back in October of last
year, issued an advisory

538
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,980
that if you do pay a ransom
and it is tracked back

539
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,230
to a terrorist organization,
you will be fined,

540
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,963
your organization can be
fined up to $20 million.

541
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:25,610
And so that's just insult to
injury of you paying a ransom

542
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,439
and then finding out that
you're gonna be fined

543
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,740
because it did go to a
terrorist organization.

544
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,580
You know, cyber resiliency
is really an investment,

545
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,760
it really is, it's a form of insurance

546
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,370
and it really has to be balanced
against the risk failure

547
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,060
of the systems pose
that it contributes to.

548
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,143
So what does that resiliency look like?

549
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,149
I get it that resilience
is sometimes just viewed

550
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,260
as a buzzword, replacing
business continuity

551
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,820
or disaster recovery, but
it really means placing

552
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,000
the appropriate people and
processes and procedures

553
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,570
in place to ensure that
we've limited the need

554
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,693
for enacting that business
continuity or recovery plan.

555
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,980
So again, if you look at a
recent SC Magazine article

556
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,560
it's talking about 79% of
resilient organizations

557
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,800
they use collaboration to
battle these cyber attacks.

558
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,110
Are you still super siloed
in your organization?

559
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,050
Do you have the developers
and the security team

560
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,320
and the infrastructure team,

561
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,600
are you a member of threat
sharing organizations,

562
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,909
or are you collaborating.

563
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,420
Because those organizations
that place that premium

564
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,400
on collaboration, have a
much better success rate

565
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,800
when it comes to battling these attacks.

566
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,620
Again, I think that goes
without saying, but again

567
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,060
it's important that we stress that.

568
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,370
For those organizations that
have those collaboration plans

569
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,030
in place, they've been able
to reduce their breaches

570
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,533
by over 50%.

571
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:11,849
And it's crazy for me
to think that when we,

572
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,230
when I put this together and
looked at this same survey

573
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,090
from 2020, that 77% of businesses still

574
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,337
do not have a basic
incident response plan.

575
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:22,810
And so I'm gonna give you a quick pointer

576
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,270
at the end of how you can
get one and get moving

577
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,320
on that pretty quick.

578
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,140
It's never too late to
start, it really isn't.

579
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,640
By creating a plan, conducting a quick

580
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,750
business impact analysis,
there's templates, free templates

581
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,030
all over the internet
for that, of just making

582
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,930
a quick inventory of your
systems and I realized quick,

583
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,300
if you're a multi-billion
dollar company may not happen

584
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,810
by creating an inventory
of your critical LE systems

585
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,340
and collaborating to understand
who owns those systems

586
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,120
and kind of the backups and
the failures in the redundancy

587
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,770
that may be in place for those,

588
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,550
creating an incident response
plan if you don't have one.

589
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,889
And this is what I was referring to,

590
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,850
if you go to incidentresponse.com,
there are free playbooks

591
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,939
for you there, that you can
download to start your plan.

592
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,790
And so you can have a plan,

593
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,580
it may not be very comprehensive,
but by the end of the day

594
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,439
you could have an incident
response plan ready to go

595
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,120
for your organization that
would start somewhere.

596
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,629
Something that will be in every probably

597
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,540
security presentation you've
ever seen for 20 years

598
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,730
and for 20 years into the
future is patching, right?

599
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,573
Patch, please patch all your end points.

600
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,790
Adopt a Cloud infrastructure,

601
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,280
you know Cloud isn't the
answer to everything,

602
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,520
I know a lot of security professionals

603
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
maybe don't like the Cloud
but if you're especially

604
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,379
a small or medium sized
business, the Cloud providers

605
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,910
are gonna have a lot more security

606
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,333
than you can probably provide locally.

607
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,980
Be a leader from the top, right?

608
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,620
Follow these leadership
tips, lead from the top,

609
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,523
involve your teams in the planning.

610
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,879
Follow the good cyber
hygiene of risk privilege,

611
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,300
security awareness, safe
listing of applications,

612
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,253
just really good basic cyber hygiene.

613
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,040
I wanna share a quick story here.

614
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,120
I'm talking about it's building a plan

615
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,659
and not being too late to start.

616
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,600
You know, when I originally
created this presentation

617
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,899
it was quite a few months
ago and since then,

618
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:31,899
we had a incident here in
Nashville where our AT&T,

619
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,310
the building that AT&T is in was bombed

620
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,760
and I'm sure most of you
saw that in the news.

621
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,710
And so I didn't have a personal
business continuity plan

622
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,590
built for myself and my
family and we used AT&T

623
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,760
for both our home internet
and our cell phone provider

624
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,760
and so for almost 72 hours,
we had zero communication.

625
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,330
And so it's interesting that
I give these presentations

626
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,909
all the time and still I
did have in my little kit

627
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,700
of hacking tools, I
did have a burner phone

628
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,560
that I had never used
before that I activated

629
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,800
and so we were able to at
least to make phone calls

630
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,169
'cause thankfully it was
on a different network.

631
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,580
And I am also a licensed
ham radio operator

632
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,510
and have been for almost 30 years

633
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,090
and so I was able to get my
ham radio out of the closet

634
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,470
and power it on and talk
to some folks in the area

635
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,050
to determine what was going on

636
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,810
and what was being done to fix it.

637
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,000
So I would just encourage you to also have

638
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
a personal resilience plan
for yourself and your family

639
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,540
should you lose communication.

640
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,930
It was interesting 'cause we
even going out to the stores

641
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,610
a lot of the local stores
Target and Best Buy

642
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,840
and other stores were closed
for that same 72 hours

643
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,629
because they also had no other
internet outside of AT&T.

644
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,630
So I don't know if they
didn't have diverse carriers,

645
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,730
multiple carriers coming
into their building

646
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,270
or what the situation
was, but it was a very

647
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,190
it's something new that I'd
never experienced before.

648
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,830
So I just wanted to share
that and encourage you

649
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,223
to build a personal plan as well.

650
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,770
So here are my next steps.

651
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,600
First is, again, politics
impact us every day

652
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,030
but be sure, and don't
confuse politics with morals

653
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,000
and values and personality
because those need to shine in us

654
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,710
and they should come out in us
everyday and in the workplace

655
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,850
and they can help us,
especially in times of stress,

656
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,240
and so, and crises, so
balancing those areas

657
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,373
is really essential.

658
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,270
I want to encourage you to find
the good in every situation,

659
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,160
whether that's a crisis in
your work, at your home,

660
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,530
with your family, we really can't find

661
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,760
the good in every situation,
it's just we have to,

662
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,513
it's a mindset and it's
hard, it really is hard.

663
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,669
But if we plan and practice
for these things ahead of time,

664
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,240
it makes it easier.

665
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,810
And with our team, really
our every team member

666
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,820
really does play a part,
it's not just cliche.

667
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,770
We hired them for a reason,
they have a unique skill set

668
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,940
certainly one that you
and I probably don't have,

669
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,660
so we need to really help
our team members to grow

670
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,053
in their skills by letting
them shine in these situations.

671
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,199
Be resilient, we just,
we can't win them all,

672
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,339
but we can be resilient.

673
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,130
We have to be true leaders,
you know, really in crisis

674
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,130
that's when leaders really shine

675
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,850
and we need to be transparent
and give factual communication

676
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,283
and really try to be better together.

677
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,219
And lastly, you know, I asked for help.

678
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,989
In all my presentations, I
always list the 800 number there

679
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,489
for the suicide prevention hotline.

680
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,060
If you need help, if one of
your team members needs help,

681
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,029
you can also just text the
word home there to 741741

682
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,203
and somebody will reach out
to you and call you, text you,

683
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,580
give you hope and
encouragement if you're very,

684
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,799
having anxious thoughts
or anything like that.

685
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,510
And obviously you know
there's thousands of members

686
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,010
of a RSA Conference in
RSA 365 and so when I say

687
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,020
let's have coffee, I'm
certainly happy to meet with you

688
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,150
on LinkedIn to maybe
have a virtual meeting

689
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,210
if you're not in the area,
there's iced breakers websites,

690
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,840
where we can go to, where
if there's 20 or 30 of us,

691
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,200
we can all get together and
chat but I just encourage you

692
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,569
to reach out and ask for help.

693
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,610
So I really appreciate
you joining us today

694
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,550
and I hope that you got
some valuable information

695
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,750
out of the presentation.
