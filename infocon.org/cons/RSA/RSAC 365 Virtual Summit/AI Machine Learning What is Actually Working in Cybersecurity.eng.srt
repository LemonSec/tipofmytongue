1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,390
- Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,809
I'm John Pescatore.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,300
My fancy title at SANS

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,683
is the director of
emerging security trends.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,060
Now my ninth year at SANS,

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,930
after almost 14 years as
the lead security analyst

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,763
at Gartner.

8
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,360
And spent my entire career in security

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,692
starting right out of college at NSA

10
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,430
and the US Secret Service,

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,390
and over a decade with GT,

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,260
and then onto the internet
world of firewalls

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,020
with trusted information
systems and PKI with Entrust

14
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,419
before coming to Gartner.

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,580
Got a fun topic here.

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,199
I'm gonna do about a 30 minute session

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,180
and sort of give you 60
years of history of AI

18
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,370
and machine learning,

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,040
And sorta put on my Gartner hat

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,620
and sort of debunk some myths
and some hype around it.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,919
And then drill down a little bit

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,000
into cybersecurity use cases.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,770
And then there's gonna
be a following session

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,930
by Dave Hoelzer with some great demos,

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,960
some hands on demos of
implementing some algorithms

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,100
in Python code and some
security functions.

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,587
So this one proceeds Dave's
talk and I'll stay a little bit

28
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,610
at the 50,000 foot level.

29
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,737
But definitely drill down

30
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,900
and be able to answer your questions

31
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,530
through the text
mechanisms as we go along.

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,580
So let's get started.

33
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,679
So just a little terminology,

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,110
we're gonna talk about AI

35
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,760
or artificial intelligence,

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,770
and that is pretty much
what it sounds like.

37
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,950
It's us attempting to make computers mimic

38
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,260
what humans do as far as
problem solving generally.

39
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,270
And we're gonna zero in

40
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,050
on a subset of all that
which is machine learning.

41
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,789
Which is we're trying to fool people

42
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,620
into thinking the computer
is solving problems

43
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,290
without actually being programmed.

44
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,960
Now we always have to program computers.

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
They don't do much without us.

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,820
But rather than sort of rigid algorithms

47
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,250
or single use functions,

48
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,730
not just calculate the
trajectory of rockets and bombs,

49
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,180
but figure out the best
way to hit a moving ship

50
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,670
from another moving ship.

51
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,210
Might be something you might think

52
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,050
of old uses of machine learning.

53
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,300
We're not really gonna talk about

54
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,440
sort of something you hear
a lot about deep learning.

55
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,750
Which is where we start trying
to involve neural networks

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,410
and try to really make
CPUs add up to acting

57
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,910
like the human brain does.

58
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,140
Which can be a good thing in many cases,

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,020
in many cases not so good a thing,

60
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,170
but it's very hard to do.

61
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,150
So we're gonna focus
pretty much completely here

62
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,500
on machine learning.

63
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,710
And what I wanted to do is give you

64
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,970
a little bit of drill down there.

65
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,990
So there's two broad classes

66
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,750
of machine learning you'll hear about.

67
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,690
The bottom one you see there
is supervised learning.

68
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,590
This is essentially where the simple ones

69
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,980
you might think of, have a bunch of inputs

70
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,959
and a bunch of outputs.

71
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,480
A bunch of dots on a graph,

72
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,130
that we have an X axis and a Y axis,

73
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,609
and the computer says here's the equation

74
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,740
that makes those lines or here's
how to connect those dots,

75
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,520
and a line or a curve that fits them.

76
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,130
So often it's minimizing the errors

77
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,530
between the line and the dots.

78
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,920
And you often hear machine learning

79
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,662
called minimize losses, ML.

80
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,220
Now, the sort of Holy Grail,

81
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,680
or the more glamorous cases,

82
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,850
unsupervised or autonomous learning,

83
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,609
we just sort of dump a lot of data

84
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,210
into the top of the computer.

85
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,990
And it starts doing
something with that data.

86
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,200
Now, mostly it turns out
that's good for clustering

87
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,399
where it can tell you these events

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,860
or these pieces of data that were tagged

89
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,000
in certain ways.

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,390
They're related to each other

91
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,649
and this blob over here or this cluster.

92
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,170
And there's another cluster over there

93
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,790
that's related to each other.

94
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,760
And we'll drill down on that.

95
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,149
You might think of in
a cybersecurity case,

96
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,450
here's a bunch of things
CIS admins are doing

97
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,649
that probably were good things.

98
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,410
They were doing backups
or replicating databases.

99
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,710
Here's a cluster of things
CIS admins are doing

100
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,610
but they only looked at
one record at a time.

101
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,670
That could be a bad thing.

102
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,609
That could be an attacker

103
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,510
that could be CIS admin gone bad

104
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,030
and starting to surf the database.

105
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,130
So those are the two broad classes

106
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,963
and we're gonna get back

107
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:37,870
into the real world
example of these laters.

108
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,350
But I promised you 60 years of history.

109
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,600
So let's tackle that.

110
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,079
So here's something Harvard put together

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,200
a few years ago in a paper they wrote,

112
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,148
that was very interesting.

113
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:50,000
You see the timeline of the history

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,880
of the term artificial intelligence

115
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,555
and it sort of really
dates back to 1950 to 1960.

116
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:59,330
And 1950, Alan Turing
published can machines think

117
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,210
which started this.

118
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,540
And he's the creator of
the famous Turing test

119
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,799
which is still used today to determine

120
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,860
if natural language processing

121
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,210
that computers do could
really fool somebody

122
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,200
into believing it's a human.

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Now, if you see that blue curve

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,500
and the numbers on the left-hand side,

125
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,450
what they also did is over the years,

126
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,360
they ran LexisNexis searches
of the LexisNexis database

127
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,300
for the term artificial intelligence.

128
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,810
And the blue line represents

129
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,620
sort of the popularity of the term.

130
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,670
What percent of all LexisNexis
items contain the word AI.

131
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,520
So it is sort of, it's
like a popularity curve.

132
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,130
Now, I'm not gonna drill
down in many of these

133
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,290
but let's state the start

134
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,840
when the term first came out of say 1950.

135
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,369
And you can zoom forward.

136
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,020
I like to zoom forward to where you see

137
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,750
autonomous vehicles there in 1986.

138
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,000
The first autonomous car is
built by Carnegie Mellon.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,310
Wait a minute, 1986?

140
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,360
It's now 2021.

141
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,860
So we're 36 years later
and we're still talking

142
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,330
about autonomous vehicles.

143
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,770
So machine learning to drive cars around,

144
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,370
we're still not really ready to do.

145
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,120
Some other seminal events
there you see in 1997,

146
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,780
IBM's Deep Blue beat the chess master,

147
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,159
Garry Kasparov in chess.

148
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,227
That was sort of whenever he began to say,

149
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:09,340
"oh, we're doomed.

150
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,929
The computers are just gonna take over.

151
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,490
They can beat us at chess now."

152
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,070
And about that same year
was when dragon systems

153
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,560
put out the first sort of semi usable

154
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,150
speech recognition software
that would run on an IBM PC.

155
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,056
And that was sort of when everybody said,

156
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,140
"well, it's sorta over with,
the computers have won."

157
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,900
Well, the problem is that,
no, they really didn't win

158
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,630
here we are again, 21 years later,

159
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,950
still complaining about how bad

160
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,050
Siri is, that voice recognition.

161
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,180
And while the computers
have gone on to beat masters

162
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,580
at other games like go and jeopardy even

163
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,140
we haven't seen them solve

164
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,880
a lot of the unbounded
problems we need to deal with.

165
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,540
And we'll drill down on
that in a little bit.

166
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,370
Now as I said,

167
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,260
I'm gonna put my Gartner
hat on here for a bit.

168
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,560
One of the more fun things

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,930
and I think useful
things we did at Gartner

170
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,720
is something called a hype curve.

171
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,050
When you see one on your screen there

172
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,750
for artificial intelligence,

173
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,740
let me tell you how they work.

174
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,030
On the left you see innovation trigger.

175
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,049
These are new things that come about

176
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,340
and artificial intelligence
is when you can think

177
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,840
of quantum computing or
blockchain as showing up somewhere

178
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,900
and you see quantum computing here.

179
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,799
Anything new immediately
or quickly generally

180
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,640
zooms up to the peak of
overinflated expectations.

181
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,710
It gets hyped up.

182
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,950
Quantum computing is gonna kill encryption

183
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,830
or it's gonna make the bad guys win.

184
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,359
And then it zooms down into the trough

185
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,970
of disillusionment
where it turns out well,

186
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,940
it's really hard to do
quantum computing, right?

187
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,740
And what the heck is
blockchain doing for us anyway?

188
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,380
And then some things get stuck

189
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,060
in that trough of
disillusionment and go away.

190
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,710
I remember years ago, remember
the two wheel thing segway

191
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,049
it's like a lawnmower with two wheels,

192
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,690
just stand on and ride around.

193
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,680
That was gonna revolutionize highways

194
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:51,710
and force cars off the road.

195
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,739
And now it's sort of like, yeah

196
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,510
I think tourists use
them in a lot of cities

197
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,409
but you don't see any,
maybe a mailman or two.

198
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,950
You don't see a heck of
a lot of segways anymore.

199
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,330
But in most cases, in many cases,

200
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,560
technology does escape that trap

201
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,360
and then flows out into the
plateau of productivity there.

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,220
And I'm actually gonna get rid

203
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,180
of my little video windows
up here so I can see.

204
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,880
And you see in this case on AI,

205
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,219
graphics processing unit accelerators

206
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,200
to run a lot of the number crunching

207
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,630
for machine learning is something

208
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,659
that's in this plateau of productivity.

209
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
It just works.

210
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,720
And these days with what's
happening with Alexa and okay,

211
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,400
I'll give Siri a break
and other medical uses

212
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,969
and other things the speech recognition.

213
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,770
It's just a commonly used technique.

214
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,070
So that's out in the
plateau of productivity.

215
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,110
So here, if you can see my cursor,

216
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,420
if we look in the middle
of the curve here,

217
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,620
you see machine learning

218
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,080
and that's what we're gonna zoom into.

219
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
So this was the 2019 magic quadrant

220
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,460
from Gartner and using some
fancy computer animation,

221
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,190
I'll show you how things
moved in the 2020 version.

222
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,530
And you'll see, machine learning

223
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,210
really hasn't made a heck
of a lot of progress there.

224
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,169
Really not too many
things that made progress.

225
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,800
If you look down here in the
trough of disillusionment

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,390
coded that'd be obsolete before plateau.

227
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,530
You see cognitive computing,

228
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,409
which is really a very high level term

229
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,090
for essentially computers
being able to think and act

230
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,429
and communicate like humans.

231
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,070
So I think the feeling

232
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,210
is they're really not gonna
ever really reach that point,

233
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,270
no matter how many MIPS
we can throw at them

234
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,530
or megabytes or new types of technology

235
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,059
or cooling systems or quantum computing.

236
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,520
But we wanna focus on
machine learning anyway.

237
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,380
So let's drill down.

238
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,210
It turns out Gartner also did
a separate magic quadrant.

239
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,640
I mean I'm sorry, hype cycle,
just on machine learning

240
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,069
you see on your screen now.

241
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,500
So in this case, we're
looking at a couple of things

242
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,750
that are meaningful insecurity,
advanced anomaly detection,

243
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,080
where you see the red arrow pointing.

244
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,460
That's really what we're trying to do

245
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,360
in security with these tools

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
is move beyond simple
signature based detection

247
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,090
of what's malware or simple
signature-based rules

248
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,220
for intrusion detection and prevention.

249
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,567
And have some tools that are able to say,

250
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,200
"hey, a bunch of stuff just happened.

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
It looks suspicious.

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,470
It looks like this.

253
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,420
It looks anomalous and it looks
like a dangerous anomaly."

254
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,610
That's what we're looking for.

255
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,910
But I wanted to point a few others out

256
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,240
if you see down here towards
the trough, you see Python.

257
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,270
Python is the most popular
programming language used

258
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,650
in machine learning and
artificial intelligence.

259
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,290
And it has lots of library functions

260
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,490
for all the complicated math that's needed

261
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,587
to create the models
and run the algorithms

262
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:19,890
and machine learning.

263
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,170
And Spark is sort of a
analytics data processing engine

264
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,979
that's widely used in AI and
machine learning as well.

265
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,280
So in this case in 2019
Gartner had them essentially

266
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,390
near the trough of this
solution which basically,

267
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,340
nobody understood at the
time when this came out

268
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,697
since these are widely
used, even back in 2019.

269
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:38,220
And it would've made a lot more sense

270
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,780
to see them further up the plateau

271
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,760
but we're really interested
in advanced anomaly detection.

272
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,910
So let's look at the 2020
one and see what happened.

273
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,050
And what happened is it disappeared.

274
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,300
Wait a minute I don't
see anomaly detection

275
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,132
on there anymore.

276
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,520
In fact, I don't even see Python.

277
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,270
I do see Apache Spark
moved out to the left

278
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,890
on the plateau where it should be.

279
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,380
And if you read the text,
you see on the left,

280
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,490
they said we don't see
anybody even talking

281
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,570
about advanced anomaly detection anymore.

282
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,530
So we dropped it. (laughing)

283
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,939
So what that tells you
is it hasn't really been

284
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,150
tremendously useful for
advanced anomaly detection

285
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,240
just magically finding
bad stuff among good stuff

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,730
without also false a lot and again

287
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,780
we'll drill down into
that quite a bit as well.

288
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,690
Spark got widely adopted.

289
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,070
And it said, yeah, Python's
also widely adopted.

290
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,070
So we just pushed it off the hype cycle.

291
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,540
So it was a recognition
that Python and Spark

292
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,560
are really useful tools.

293
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,079
I'm gonna give you some URLs at the end

294
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,370
you could do some more drill down

295
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,860
and you'll see Dave Hoelzer

296
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,390
doing his onscreen demo using Python.

297
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,370
I believe he's using Spark as well.

298
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,120
So that sort of shows you
where things progressed

299
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,670
in the hype and let's start
moving more towards the reality.

300
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,319
But before I did that I
wanna give you an example

301
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,350
of some recent hype.

302
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,840
And I'm gonna pick on Microsoft.

303
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,980
There was hundreds of
vendors I could have chose.

304
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,980
I just thought Microsoft
slide captured everything

305
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,950
all in one slide.

306
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,830
So as you know, built into windows

307
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,390
Microsoft has lots of things

308
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,660
like Windows Defender that
are antiviral type things.

309
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,449
Then they also sell other products

310
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,950
that do security stuff
and find security stuff.

311
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,250
And they talked about it in this one slide

312
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,240
they used every possible
buzzword around machine learning

313
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,550
and AI that you could have.

314
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,439
You see at the very top

315
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
on the client level,
client machine learning

316
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,440
what runs on a windows PC.

317
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,900
They have models,
behavior based detection,

318
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,160
algorithms, generics, and heuristics.

319
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,360
By the way, let me give
you one bit of wisdom

320
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,620
I learned over those 14 years at Gartner.

321
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,350
Whenever I heard a vendor use the H words,

322
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,510
heuristics or holistic,

323
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,650
I knew there were sort of blowing smoke.

324
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,199
You know, I always said heuristics meant

325
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,010
meant not documented and holistics

326
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,410
meant non-existent basically.

327
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,242
But we'd like to talk

328
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:48,480
about holistic security and heuristics.

329
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,550
And that really means
they're not something

330
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,770
we can nail down very well.

331
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,710
So then that's what runs
on windows in the end point

332
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,870
on the PC.

333
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,840
That's the important part

334
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,360
cause that's where the
attackers are hitting.

335
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,350
You think about this solar winds thing.

336
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,040
If we didn't get them, when
they got to the client side

337
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,060
we were too late.

338
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,540
Now out in the cloud where the client

339
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,829
can call out to the cloud,
Microsoft has all kinds

340
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,663
of other things running.

341
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,900
Machine learning, metadatabase
models, sample analysis

342
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,170
based machine learning model,

343
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,349
destination-based machine learning models

344
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,120
and the magical big data
analytics down there.

345
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,890
All running out at the
cloud, doing things.

346
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,670
And they give you an example of using them

347
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,180
against the smoke loader
campaign and behavior based.

348
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,020
But one thing I'm gonna emphasize

349
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,090
at the end is you very rarely see the hype

350
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,570
around machine learning,
talking about false positives.

351
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,700
They're very good at saying, see, look

352
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,060
we looked for this type of thing.

353
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,599
The model found that every
single time we never missed it.

354
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,750
Well how many times does the model

355
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,410
declare some good behavior

356
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,750
good events to be the malicious ones?

357
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,900
That's a very important
number to ask any vendor

358
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,002
that's hyping up this type of
technology in their products.

359
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,700
So that's the sort of a quick
tour through the hype level.

360
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,060
And you know, in security

361
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,660
I've worked in cryptography for many years

362
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,800
and hearing wall street
call blockchain crypto

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,353
or talk about crypto.

364
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,180
I quite don't understand
what they're talking about.

365
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,439
They're just hyping something up

366
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,530
and they're sort of distorting things.

367
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,680
Same thing with when people

368
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,489
think about machine learning or AI.

369
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,780
Oh yeah, the software
that just finds stuff.

370
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,290
You just throw data at it and
it tells you what's in there.

371
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,740
And there's magical examples,

372
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,199
in the business domain of how it found

373
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,277
men buy beer and diapers
at two in the morning

374
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,750
in the grocery store.

375
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,720
Well, it turns out
somebody asked the software

376
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,810
what do men buy at the same time

377
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,520
when they're in the grocery
store at two in the morning?

378
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,240
Which is often either
where they were sent out

379
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,920
to get diapers or felt they
needed to get some beer.

380
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,390
When we start looking at both things

381
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,290
like the business domain
or the cybersecurity domain

382
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,530
where the success stories

383
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,360
and use of the technology is.

384
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,100
It's really in observing and being able

385
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,740
to inject domain expertise
into the software

386
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,120
in a variety of ways.

387
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,050
Experts systems, trying to
copy what the expert does.

388
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,089
Case-based reasonings an example I've seen

389
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,213
for many years, that's really effective.

390
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:13,150
For example in the case of power companies

391
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,590
needing to maintain their power lines.

392
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, one of the most common
reasons they come down

393
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,680
or trees falling on the wires or falling

394
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,510
across the wires due to storms, or simply

395
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,280
due to lack of trimming.

396
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,760
And being able to use
very simple techniques

397
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,540
to determine when a storm's gonna hit

398
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,130
and which way it's gonna travel.

399
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,020
Or how long it's been since the last time

400
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,850
a particular run had the trees trimmed

401
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,210
and how quickly they
grew in the last period.

402
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,770
Those are simple
case-based reasoning tools

403
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,920
that can really be
implemented in software well

404
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,640
to help get the repair crews out

405
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,569
in advance than shorten the
time down or eliminate time down

406
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,340
by trimming the trees
before they fall into wires.

407
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,880
Then there are things like fuzzy logic.

408
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,210
I never really understood that one.

409
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,550
I remember windshield wipers

410
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,270
were supposed to have fuzzy logic

411
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,819
so that I would need to turn
them slow, fast, medium.

412
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,500
They would somehow
figure out how much water

413
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,380
was on the windshield, but
that all seemed to go away.

414
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,510
But things like micro-targeting

415
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,160
which is what we saw the Russians do

416
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,089
against the United States and Facebook

417
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,840
and so on around the 2016 election.

418
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,270
Are very good examples of
taking domain expertise,

419
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,470
somebody who figured out how
do we attack small places

420
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,110
and get leverage out of that.

421
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,560
And use automated ways
to get the right message

422
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,550
or the wrong message to the right person

423
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,760
to cause things to happen.

424
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,380
Is a very important use a very creative

425
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,140
and very illustrative use
of these technologies.

426
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,470
And again, it required
that domain expertise.

427
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,320
It was not just the computer
spraying out messages.

428
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,700
Another thing I'll
emphasize again at the end.

429
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,150
And I think it's important to get across

430
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,689
to CIOs and CEOs and board of directors.

431
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,140
Just because computers can
beat us at games like chess

432
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,310
or jeopardy or go doesn't
really translate very well

433
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,449
to the cybersecurity world.

434
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,980
A chess board is a fixed dimension.

435
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,960
The pieces can only do certain things.

436
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,060
What's that thing called, the knight.

437
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,170
The knight can only move

438
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,219
in that L shape direction most times

439
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,840
every now and then it can castle.

440
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,090
But the knight can't say, I'm gonna jump

441
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,280
off the end of the board and
pop up through the bottom.

442
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,819
And the Bishop can't say,
I'm tired of going diagonally

443
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,330
I'm gonna go straight across

444
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,080
and I'm gonna just knock
everything out of my way.

445
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,380
Hackers can do that to us in cyber.

446
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,270
There are not boundaries on the problem.

447
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,189
There's a long history of why that's so.

448
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,680
in the complexities of software.

449
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,550
But beating human beings at games

450
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,680
is not really translate necessarily

451
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,920
into beating hackers at their game

452
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,969
because it's not a game,
it's a craft for them.

453
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,520
And again, there are no boundaries.

454
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,470
There's very few rules.

455
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,770
So let's look at some
of the successful uses

456
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,500
and try to draw out how we can use

457
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,440
this technology successfully
in cybersecurity.

458
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,660
So the business use is where we saw a lot

459
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,420
of this first time businesses
collect lots of data.

460
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,660
They wanna optimize their
sales and marketing resources

461
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,329
or their product development resources

462
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,810
and make the best decisions.

463
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,609
So here's a typical marketing example

464
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,770
where at the top of this funnel

465
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,060
they had a bunch of names from
databases or subscriptions

466
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,040
or whatever possible people
to sell their product to.

467
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,047
And then they started to say,

468
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,200
"well, if we called
every one of those names,

469
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
even with some cheap college kid working

470
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,390
on the weekends for pennies,
we'd waste a lot of money.

471
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,710
How do we zero in on the ones

472
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,400
most likely to be receptive
to buying our product?"

473
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,470
And so then they used
some factors to determine

474
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,040
if a person's engaged,
they've visited the booth.

475
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,690
Clicked on something on the website

476
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,745
pretended to listen in a
webinar while they really

477
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,310
read their email.

478
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,950
And that got to the engaged
level, then marketing qualified

479
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,650
took those names and
figured out which ones

480
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,340
demographically or
geographically meet the profile.

481
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,320
Or had good digital body
language were often seen

482
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,120
on social medias in forums
related to the product and so on.

483
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,750
And that essentially comes
down to a sales qualified lead

484
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,730
where we take scarce, human resources

485
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,820
inside sales folks, or direct sales folks

486
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
and sit them on the people and talk them

487
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,409
into at least trying our
product and maybe buying it.

488
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,510
We get them on the
pipeline and then we win.

489
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,200
So what we did is turn a bunch of names

490
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,970
into revenue at the bottom.

491
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,010
Now the computer software
used to do this was critical

492
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,090
but it wasn't simply
pour names at the bottom

493
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,429
and orders at the top.

494
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,280
And the orders fall at the bottom.

495
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,480
We've used a lot of hard
learned marketing lessons

496
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,830
from smart marketing and
salespeople over the years

497
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,520
to implement this in this
funnel that made this happen.

498
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,500
And that's sort of this as
the most successful example

499
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,500
in these same needs to do this
good data, labeling the data.

500
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,020
These are engaged people.

501
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,650
These are marketing qualified leads.

502
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,540
These are from this geography.

503
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,730
These are this age range.

504
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,640
These are this sex.

505
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,860
There's this language.

506
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,060
Labeling the data's key.

507
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,793
The quality of the data is key.

508
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,200
So cybersecurity, very similar.

509
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,180
Most of the success stories have been

510
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,300
really smart security people
being able to implement

511
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,730
some of the ways they do things

512
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,980
in software or really
smart software people

513
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,430
being observed what really
smart security people do.

514
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,310
And we call it a security unicorns.

515
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,646
And be able to give them some tool

516
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,620
to let the security unicorns focus

517
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,000
on the really high value
problems and then pass

518
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,350
on some of that expertise in
the models, in the algorithms.

519
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,100
So the algorithms can be
used to prioritize events

520
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,790
or indicate candidate events

521
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,610
that more junior analysts can respond to.

522
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,010
And by the end of the day,

523
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,500
we're hoping that by ordering the events

524
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,040
and the most likely to be dangerous

525
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,649
will get to all the important ones.

526
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,720
Cause that's the name of the game.

527
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,710
Within the bounds of our resources

528
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,420
can we hit all the important things.

529
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,850
If you think of the
solar wind things again

530
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,469
if we're finding now the indicators

531
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,720
of once the compromised
solar wind software

532
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,810
started to be used for the attacks.

533
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,750
If we do more quickly
detected those indicators

534
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,070
just think of how much less
damage would have occurred.

535
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,220
So I can't emphasize enough
the quality of the response

536
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,290
and the action is so tightly related

537
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,770
to the quality of the data.

538
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,000
It's not simply let's throw
every SIS log we have added

539
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,240
or every piece of data we can find at it.

540
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,330
Most of the SANS instructors will tell you

541
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,870
that yeah, you know more data's important

542
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,080
but the right data is most important.

543
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,439
And the quality of that data,

544
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,270
the accuracy of the data, the timeliness,

545
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,160
the freshness of it and
so on is so important.

546
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,590
Garbage in garbage out

547
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,360
that law does not change

548
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,250
just cause we have really fast computers

549
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,780
and Python and Spark to throw at the data.

550
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,190
So, you know, in most of the many years

551
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,730
I've worked in internet
security the problem you see

552
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,830
up here is what we've been dealing with.

553
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,080
We've got a lot of data
at the top of this funnel

554
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,510
a lot of raw attack,
data hitting firewalls

555
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,350
or routers and logs and SIM
events starting to pile out.

556
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,500
And we're trying to get that down

557
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,780
to the bottom, which are the ones

558
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,889
we have to initiate
actions quickly against.

559
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,930
And it's really important
to be keeping these metrics

560
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,100
both on what's our status
of prevention and detection

561
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,830
but also how quickly we're moving

562
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,860
and actually less important.

563
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,689
What quantity of things that we see.

564
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,170
We always wanna keep track of quantities

565
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,600
so we can convince management,
we're doing something.

566
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,139
But really how fast we
move in internet security

567
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,630
and how accurate our actions
are, is really what's key.

568
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,110
So we take that same funnel
approach, and we look

569
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,990
at the uses for AI, ML, machine learning.

570
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,230
Wanna feed more data.

571
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,970
Wanna make sure that's
clean and relevant data

572
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,100
apply that domain expertise
and go through all these steps.

573
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,439
And at the bottom line,
we wanna move faster

574
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,750
and we wanna have less mission
impact from two vectors.

575
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,820
One for the bad guys

576
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,480
we wanna reduce the impact the bad guys

577
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,550
have on the business or the mission.

578
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,680
But also reduce the impact
from the security measures

579
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,430
whether it's false positives
that are really disruptive

580
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,760
or simply disruptions
as we clean systems up

581
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,076
or as we shut things down or disconnect

582
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,850
when we are required to investigate.

583
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,580
Bottom line faster and
helping the business,

584
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,159
not hurting the business.

585
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,750
So let's drill down a little bit.

586
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,760
You'll see, again, Dave
Hoelzer will present

587
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,360
some of these things, but
in the different types

588
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,100
of machine learning, clustering
has been very useful.

589
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,570
So this ability to use unsupervised

590
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,360
or automated machine
learning tools to say,

591
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,520
if you look at this graph,
this blob of events,

592
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,440
they're all related.

593
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,020
This blob over here is also all related.

594
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,620
By quickly sampling a few in those blobs

595
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,870
you can say, "oh, anything that falls

596
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,429
in this blob is probably gonna be bad.

597
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,400
Anything that falls in this
blob we better drill down

598
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,150
into cause that may be a normal

599
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,620
or privileged user doing
something that appears dangerous."

600
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,679
So the supervised learning where we take

601
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,540
here's a set of inputs, instead of outputs

602
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,960
has been really useful
for classifying things.

603
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,950
This is malware or not
malware spam or not.

604
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,960
This is ransomware
trying to encrypt things

605
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,930
or this is a breach trying
to exfiltrate things.

606
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,050
Now, when you take these
two types of techniques

607
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,100
and certain blobs may lend themselves

608
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,000
to being better fed to certain
engines that are focused

609
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,720
on certain events,
classified as certain events

610
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,180
commonly using both techniques together

611
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,500
we can get cybersecurity value.

612
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,290
So the one that's been used for years

613
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,149
this is nothing new.

614
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,330
The Symantecs and McAfee's and trends

615
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,409
have been doing this
for years in their labs.

616
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,660
And now in the cloud is basically saying

617
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,390
here's a bunch of good files,

618
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,050
and now here's a bunch of bad files.

619
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,980
And so for the good files,
you extract features

620
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,100
and as we feed your bad files,
you look at their features

621
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,550
and we have a model that
spits out at the end.

622
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,970
Yeah that last thing you fed me

623
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,950
looks more like a bad
file than a good file.

624
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,430
The last one you fed me

625
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,930
looks more like a good
file than a bad file.

626
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,690
So the more data we can feed it

627
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,810
to make those features more
meaningful or more specific

628
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,496
the better the accuracy can get.

629
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:28,980
And the smarter the techniques

630
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,950
and models that are used and
the faster things can be done

631
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,130
we can be more accurate
and more timely as well.

632
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,470
And so in malware detection, quite often,

633
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,920
you'll see this, this is
to some extent signatures

634
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,250
brought up to the next level

635
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,970
when you think about it.

636
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,080
Now a little more (indistinct)
use is this an example

637
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,169
from Anteros who's a supply
chain security company.

638
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,040
And their whole goal is to
sell you software and services

639
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,810
where you look at all your
supply chain providers

640
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,159
and determine what risk
level you have from them.

641
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,170
And one thing they've been doing

642
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,880
with machine learning is using

643
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,010
natural language processing models.

644
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,030
And they feed them in news
articles from API feeds,

645
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,710
from RSS, from websites and the like.

646
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,100
News articles about companies

647
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,179
and the models extract, which
company, what type of events.

648
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,850
And they do that cluster and classifying

649
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,850
we just talked about, and they basically

650
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,570
identify which company
or companies is involved.

651
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,629
And then they link them to risk events

652
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,280
that come out of in terrorist
analyst, things about risk.

653
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,797
And they'll tell you, "well, wait a minute

654
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:33,590
obviously solar winds is now judged

655
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,070
as highly risky cause
it's been in the news."

656
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,960
But if you think about a
company that went bankrupt

657
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,270
or a company that had a breach,

658
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,510
well if it turned out
that seven other companies

659
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,370
use that company or just hired
somebody from that company.

660
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,520
These types of techniques
might say your supply

661
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,160
chain partner wasn't directly breached.

662
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,350
But they either are using
suppliers who were breached

663
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,550
or they've been hiring people

664
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,720
who've either had bad luck or maybe evil.

665
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,160
So this is an example of using
natural language processing

666
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,340
in newsfeeds to try to
highlight a cybersecurity risk

667
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,173
and a supply chain.

668
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,160
That's kind of cool.

669
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,760
Now there's lots of toolkits out there

670
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
to build your own examples
and play with these

671
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,693
in a number of different ways.

672
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,110
Scikit and Tensorflow up there

673
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,530
which are two you can play with
in the Microsoft Azure one.

674
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,860
Dave Bianco has a great example here

675
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,580
in this tool called CLEARCUT.

676
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,010
You see his GitHub repository there.

677
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,490
Now what he put together
is essentially a model

678
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,060
or an engine where you can feed it

679
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,840
in HTTP records, HDTV traffic records.

680
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,500
And it'll tell you if it sees anything

681
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,660
that looks like command
and control traffic.

682
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,510
Which would tell you that
something on the inside

683
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,590
got compromised and is
talking out to the command

684
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,840
and control center to
download the next stage

685
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,800
or start to exfiltrate and so on.

686
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,270
And he's been adding
to that over the years.

687
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,440
You'll see many other things
he's done there and others.

688
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,350
And you'll also find lots of libraries.

689
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,149
I mentioned in Python for
all the sort of basic tools

690
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,280
you need to do a lot of the
big data processing functions

691
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,193
and the math to implement these.

692
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,449
Another area and this is
Dave Hoelzer's GitHub page.

693
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,470
And you'll hear from
Dave in that next session

694
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,100
I keep hyping up.

695
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,129
The thing he did if you see

696
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,320
the check your Pulse Secure there.

697
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,570
So the Pulse Secure VPN
appliances and software

698
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,939
have had a bunch of vulnerabilities

699
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,530
and Pulse Secure put out patches.

700
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,530
These date back or let's
see 2019, mid 2019.

701
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,030
People have been very slow

702
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,530
especially government
agencies to patch these.

703
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,770
So many VPN servers running
Pulse Secure software

704
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,230
have been compromised and
they put together a tool

705
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,790
that looks at the log files
that come from Pulse Secure.

706
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,820
And can tell you, "hey, this looks like

707
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,159
it might've been compromised.

708
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,010
The way this thing's behaving

709
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,310
the way it's talking, the way
it's accepting connections.

710
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,620
This may very well have been compromised."

711
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,949
So it's an example

712
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,950
of a specific high
criticality vulnerability

713
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,600
like in Pulse Secure and
using these techniques

714
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,110
to not just look for
signatures sort of simple

715
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,879
IDS signatures of meeting
attackers against it.

716
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,610
But looking at the behavior

717
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,899
of the inputs and outputs of
that server via the log events

718
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,450
and determining that
something may have gone wrong.

719
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,139
One last example, and
just kind of pointing out

720
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,820
where the human expertise is needed.

721
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,530
Endgame's a company that did
a lot of machine learning

722
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,360
and end point detection and response tool.

723
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,090
They were acquired by
elastic, they got data search

724
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,199
engine company that's widely used.

725
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,550
And this is an example of
one of their cool tools

726
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,810
from their machine learning module

727
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,740
that essentially they threw lots of events

728
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,380
at it and classified
things in certain ways.

729
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,750
And if you look under the
view by, you see the job ID,

730
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,860
and you'll think of those
as processes running,

731
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,479
and you can quickly zoom
into the series of red things

732
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,820
you see on the sort of middle right there.

733
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,919
And the demo status
code rate is coded red.

734
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,660
And if you look down at the bottom

735
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,880
you can see the severity threshold warning

736
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,000
and time February 1st, 2017, severity 99.

737
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,690
And it says NGI and X access
source IP high counts.

738
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,570
So this is saying some
code path was executed

739
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,710
way more frequently than normal.

740
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,220
And you should drill down on this.

741
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,320
Now it seems like a sort
of a simple threshold alert

742
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
but you look at all the data

743
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,480
on the screen and what
you would need to do

744
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,820
to really understand what's going on.

745
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,210
Just using many of these
machine learning products

746
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,030
requires skill if nothing
else, skill and knowledge

747
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,350
of that tool but in
reality skill and knowledge

748
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,990
of the basic concepts of machine learning

749
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,160
and of information security in general.

750
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,930
To understand and be able to use the tools

751
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,280
in a meaningful way.

752
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,600
So again, keep that in mind.

753
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,850
Staff training and domain expertise

754
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,629
is what underlies all successful uses.

755
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,780
You know, these tools
can be forced multipliers

756
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,740
but if your force is close to zero

757
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,540
you can't multiply it all that much.

758
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,373
And really key.

759
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:48,740
None of these tools
fully automate anything.

760
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,320
If you're not already doing
something you can't automate it.

761
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,040
You cannot automate what you
don't already know how to do.

762
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,240
The quality of the data is really key.

763
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,120
The noisiness of the data.

764
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,280
You can't just say let's feed the computer

765
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,170
a bunch of noise and it'll find a signal.

766
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,470
You have to feed it something
that has a signal in it

767
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,600
somewhere or all it's gonna
come back out is noise.

768
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,280
And again, I can't
emphasize enough this part

769
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,810
about should I do a lot of
board of directors briefings

770
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,500
and I try to make sure this is well known.

771
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,300
Because there's this assumption

772
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,270
that the fact that computers
won at chess and jeopardy,

773
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,379
which I think really blew away

774
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,810
a lot of board of director types,

775
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,830
means a lot more than it
really does in cybersecurity.

776
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,720
And again, I hit this several times.

777
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,460
False positives are the traditional killer

778
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,250
of security advances.

779
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,140
All it takes is one false positive

780
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,060
where we shut the database
down or disconnect

781
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,200
from the internet or blow the ability

782
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,950
to meet the numbers for the quarter.

783
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,910
And we've just pushed the
security program back years.

784
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,070
So a false negative
missing in fact seems bad

785
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,020
but quite often a false
positive can actually

786
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,200
be more dangerous than a false negative.

787
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,780
And always ask about false positive rates

788
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,930
when you're evaluating products

789
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,310
claiming to use machine learning

790
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,123
or AI or someday deep learning.

791
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,750
So bottom line is unfortunately

792
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,710
there's still no such
thing as a free lunch.

793
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,750
As we all know the triad
of first having people,

794
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,210
smart people, skilled people
who could work together

795
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,965
and develop and document
useful and adaptable processes

796
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:18,480
to get ahead of the bad
guys, or at least keep even

797
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,530
with the bad guys.

798
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,690
And then implement some
of those or all of those

799
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,410
as much as possible, those
processes using technology

800
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,320
that can sort of be a force multiplier

801
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,010
for those scarce number of humans.

802
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,970
Those three things
together are what underlie

803
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,830
that every success story we've
ever had in cybersecurity.

804
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,879
I do a thing for SANS it's
called the what works program

805
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,640
where we highlight sort of these.

806
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,800
And you never just find, oh yeah

807
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,639
we just bought this tool
and everything got better.

808
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,300
Or we just hired Sally
and everything got better.

809
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,290
It's always a mix of all three of these

810
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,750
that all of a sudden
the aha moment comes up

811
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,630
and we're able to
demonstrate to management.

812
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,470
Hey, look you saw on the
news who got hit by this.

813
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,910
We didn't get hit by this cause
here's what we were doing.

814
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,530
So kind of sum it up.

815
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,460
I wanted to leave you with some resources.

816
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,490
There's the SANS reading room

817
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,660
where you can see all the white papers

818
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,550
and things we continue
to publish, including

819
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,149
from the students that
take our masters class.

820
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,340
We make them all do masters
papers on meaningful topics.

821
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,310
So we get to publish them

822
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,639
and help the rest of the world out.

823
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,940
There's a link to Dave Hoelzer's

824
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,820
practical machine learning, YouTube video.

825
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,470
It's cool to watch, or
you might wanna watch that

826
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,450
after you watch his session next.

827
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,210
Chris Davis did a very
cool YouTube video as well.

828
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,470
I think it's actually a presentation.

829
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,120
If I remember right, that
he did it crinkle con

830
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,020
in 2019 on cybersecurity
machine language use cases.

831
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,600
And he'll give you a little repeat

832
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,909
of some of what I did.

833
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,520
He does some really cool drill down.

834
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,470
And I just wanted to close

835
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,030
with a cool program SANS invested in

836
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,450
called cyber start over the years.

837
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,470
And it's culminated in rolling out

838
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,420
across many states now
getting high school kids

839
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,010
free access to SANS online training.

840
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,800
And if they can succeed in
games and take the training

841
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,389
and pass the courses, they can
win scholarships and colleges

842
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,250
and community colleges

843
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,960
and get applied bachelor's
degree in cybersecurity.

844
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,300
So for your kids, your brother,
your sister, your nieces,

845
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,129
nephews, your neighbor's kids,
your grandkids, if you're old

846
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,210
like some people are out there.(laughing)

847
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,340
Refer them to this program.

848
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,173
It's really cool.

849
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:10,760
And it's something we're investing in

850
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,080
to just try to get more people

851
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,050
into this industry and help
advance the state of the people

852
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,620
so we can take more advantages

853
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,260
of tools like machine learning.

854
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,173
So with that, thanks and
enjoy the rest of the program.
