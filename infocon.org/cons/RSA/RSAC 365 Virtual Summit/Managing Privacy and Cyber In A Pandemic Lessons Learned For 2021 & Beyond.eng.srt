1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,679
- Hi everyone, I'm Behnam Dayanim.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,540
I'm partner and global chair

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,609
of the Privacy and Cybersecurity Practice

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,250
at the law firm Paul Hastings.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,020
I am based in Washington DC,

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,020
although I haven't seen Washington
DC for many, many months.

7
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:18,150
I'm doing this broadcast or
video or webinar from my home.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,270
I'm glad to be here with all of you.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm gonna talk today

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,540
about how to manage privacy
and cyber in a pandemic.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,270
Lessons learned for 2021 and beyond.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,490
So, what are we gonna talk about?

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,489
Well, COVID really has both
accelerated certain trends

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,970
and also upended certain
pre-existing assumptions

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,839
that people had about data privacy

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,290
and cybersecurity prior to the pandemic.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,600
It's accelerated the
transition to remote work,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,203
as of course increased
reliance on remote resources.

19
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:54,125
And at the same time,

20
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:58,390
it's really changed expectations
about what types of data

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,520
employers might expect
from their employees.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,930
And I think both of these trends

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,480
are likely to last much longer

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,730
than the simply the
length of the pandemic,

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,110
which itself has lasted longer

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,310
than I think many of us
would have anticipated

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,490
and certainly would have hoped.

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,920
And both do have very
significant implications

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,660
for privacy and cybersecurity.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,690
So let's dive into them.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,423
So firstly, in terms of
upending expectations.

32
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,850
As many businesses start to move

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,149
into the office reopening phase,

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,680
one of the real questions that they face

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,080
is the types of information
that they're collecting.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,340
And I think it's important for those of us

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,600
who serve in privacy or
in cybersecurity roles,

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,100
or as legal counsel,

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,869
to really challenge the
extent of information

40
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,300
that is truly needed
for office re-openings.

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,810
For example, we know that many businesses

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,740
are conducting temperature checks

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,860
of employees when they enter the building,

44
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,130
and turning folks away

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,339
if they show a fever or
other signs of illness.

46
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,280
Is there really a need to record that?

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Or is it simply enough

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,139
to know that you have
that process in place?

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,859
And so that anybody who's
been admitted to the building,

50
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,400
has satisfied those criteria

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,870
without having to record
that Jane Doe or John Smith

52
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:21,960
had their temperature checked,
the temperature was X.

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,480
Or even Jane Doe was turned away,

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,119
because she failed the temperature check.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,953
The question is,

56
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:29,330
is it really necessary
to have that information?

57
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,143
I would price it in most
cases, it is not, right?

58
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,713
And if there is an insistence,

59
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,730
that any particular item
of information is needed,

60
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,519
then they really should be
questioned and challenged

61
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,200
and documented as to why it is

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,769
that, that information was needed.

63
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,540
And once you've gotten past that stage,

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,750
and have decided that you actually do need

65
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,420
the particular data element,

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,739
then of course, there's a
question about how to collect

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,180
and store and to ensure
that it is protected.

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,540
And also it's important,

69
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,049
I'll talk more about that in a moment,

70
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,520
it's also important to understand
state and local mandates

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,910
on reporting positive test
results and contact tracing.

72
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,220
Those will vary from state to state

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,250
and from locality to locality.

74
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,260
In many cases, there will be obligations

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,880
incumbent upon the employer,

76
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,510
if they become aware of
a positive test result

77
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,179
to notify the authorities.

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,720
Which ones counter in many respects

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,980
to a traditional privacy standpoint

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,859
in terms of not sharing
employee information here,

81
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,860
those laws would trap any
ordinary default position

82
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,550
and would in fact require disclosure.

83
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,900
Now what's interesting I thought,

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,390
some interesting data points

85
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,660
might be of interest here in this regard,

86
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,720
and an IAPPUI report that was done

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,320
just within the past six weeks or so,

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,299
looked at data collection
efforts by employers.

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,830
And as you see here on
the slide, indicated that,

90
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,970
many employers, an
overwhelming majority, 76%,

91
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,130
have asked employees to notify them

92
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,010
if they're diagnosed with COVID.

93
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,140
A little of a half had asked employees

94
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,882
about their personal travel,

95
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,440
a little over a third, have asked about

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,960
household members COVID status,
and a little under a quarter

97
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,590
had taken temperatures of employees

98
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,250
along the lines that I was
just describing a moment ago.

99
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,100
All of these things
are really quite novel,

100
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
quite remarkable, when you think about it.

101
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,709
Not the kinds of questions

102
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,280
that one would ordinarily have expected

103
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,770
employers to be asking of their employees.

104
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,469
And I would posit that we
will see in the near future

105
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,660
an additional question here,
additional bullet point,

106
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,140
if the survey is done
a few months from now,

107
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,210
regarding organizations
they've asked employees

108
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,020
to notify them if they've been vaccinated,

109
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,010
that'll be the next step.

110
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,960
And the question that companies
will have to grapple with,

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,063
is, is to what extent they
want to know that information.

112
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,580
In addition, three in 10 organizations

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,000
have been asked to share
anonymized COVID data

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,090
with a third party
whether it's a government

115
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,109
research organization or an NGO,

116
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,410
20% have shared the names of
staff who have been diagnosed

117
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,940
either with other employees
or with government officials.

118
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,320
And I'm gonna talk a little
bit more about that as well.

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,623
15% have conducted a DPIA,

120
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,840
a Data Privacy Impact Assessment,

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,823
focused on COVID collection,
that's a good thing to do.

122
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,900
I'm sure most of you
watching this know that

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,200
when you have a robust
privacy complaints program,

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,270
one element of that

125
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,900
is to conduct a privacy impact assessment

126
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,979
before embarking upon a new
process or adopting a new system

127
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,860
or technology that will
involve the collection of data.

128
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,430
And about half have
adopted a new technology

129
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,330
to enable work from home.

130
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,289
And interestingly, and in some ways

131
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,340
not certainly understand
that we not surprisingly,

132
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,159
but also have some concern,

133
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,610
the majority of those have bypassed

134
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,230
or expedited their privacy
or security review.

135
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,880
There's nothing necessarily
wrong with expediting

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
privacy or security view
of new technologies,

137
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,310
but bypassing it certainly does raise

138
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,890
potential vulnerabilities
that we'll talk about.

139
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,530
Okay, so I alluded to
temperature checks earlier,

140
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,059
as I mentioned, the kinds of
questions that one should ask

141
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,130
when thinking about something
like a temperature check is,

142
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,760
do you really need to
record the responses?

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,110
Who collects those responses?

144
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,830
The building itself or the employer?

145
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,250
And as I mentioned, is it
necessary to keep it at all?

146
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,340
If you're asking for testing information,

147
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,923
when do you require
testing of your employees?

148
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,549
There's not an obvious
answer to that question.

149
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,520
And the answer will
depend in many respects

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,770
on the company's own
particular circumstances

151
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,940
and the characteristics of its workforce.

152
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,010
What do you do with the results?

153
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,630
So they mentioned, positive
results in many places

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,490
will require reporting to
governmental authorities.

155
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,840
Negative results will not.

156
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,289
And so the question then becomes,

157
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,670
how long do you retain
those negative results?

158
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,210
There's no one size fits all here,

159
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,060
but it's the kind of question
that you have to approach it

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,830
in an intentional fashion.

161
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,840
And how do you communicate
a positive results

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,673
to the workforce?

163
00:06:58,673 --> 00:06:59,890
So for example,

164
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,640
you have an employee Jane
Doe who tested positive,

165
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,289
do you send an email
to the entire workforce

166
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,260
at that location saying that
Jane Doe tested positive?

167
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,719
That would not be the right answer.

168
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,940
That's almost never in my experience,

169
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,800
the right level of disclosure.

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,300
But you might say something like,

171
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,050
an employee who was last in the office

172
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,040
when December 23rd, tested positive,

173
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,320
he or she worked on the 10th floor.

174
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,380
And you might send that
to people in that office

175
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,610
and not in other offices.

176
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,570
So that those, it's like you're providing

177
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,380
the information necessary,

178
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,219
for people to make a determination,

179
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,880
as to whether or not they themselves

180
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,710
might have come into
contact with that person

181
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,669
or need to take some steps
to take care of themselves,

182
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,570
whether it's to monitor their own symptoms

183
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,000
or obtain a test result.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,670
Those are the kinds of questions

185
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,050
that are important to think about now,

186
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,260
before we have wide-scale re-opening,

187
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,289
because even post vaccination,

188
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,310
there will be some number of people

189
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,050
and probably quite a
large number of people

190
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,340
in the shorter term, who
have not been vaccinated

191
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,919
and who might therefore be
susceptible to the virus.

192
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
And the vaccination itself is not 100%.

193
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,799
So this kind of question will be something

194
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,770
that I think is gonna be
with us for quite some time

195
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,900
and understanding and
having a place to process

196
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,950
to deal with it will be really important.

197
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,390
And then as I mentioned whom to notify,

198
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,979
the public health agencies will typically

199
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,510
require notification of
positive test results.

200
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,700
And so each location,
each employer location,

201
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,250
should really know who those agencies are

202
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,403
and have the contact
information necessary.

203
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,449
Another very important
question is secure disposal.

204
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,943
If you are storing
testing data for example,

205
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,770
in addition to determining how long

206
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,160
you wanna store that information,

207
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,430
you really should have a plan in place

208
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,979
for securely disposing of it.

209
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,660
That's not unique to test information

210
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,240
that's true of any personal data,

211
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,600
but this is just another example

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,490
of the importance of that element

213
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,273
to a data protection program.

214
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,449
Okay, now this is quite important

215
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,860
and quite often not understood.

216
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,960
And that is the interaction
of COVID testing results,

217
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,700
testing data with HIPAA.

218
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
HIPAA of course is the Federal Law

219
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,250
that governs the Protection,
the Privacy and Security

220
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,530
of Protected Health Information.

221
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,260
It imposes quite rigorous requirements,

222
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,610
and it does not apply here.

223
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,590
And the reason it does not apply,

224
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,450
is that HIPAA covers
Protected Health Information,

225
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,930
and Protected Health Information
is health information

226
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,640
but not all health information.

227
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,600
It's health information that's
been created, collected,

228
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,510
transmitted or maintained,

229
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,650
in connection with the
provision of healthcare,

230
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,090
the payment for healthcare, or
use in healthcare operations.

231
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,600
When you have an employee
take a COVID test,

232
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,550
or have a temperature
check for that matter,

233
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,199
that is not in connection with
the provision of healthcare,

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,270
that's for employee safety,

235
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,930
employment place and employment safety,

236
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,000
it's for employer related
business operations reasons,

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,860
not for healthcare operations.

238
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,000
And so therefore as a general matter,

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,050
employee testing won't fall
within the scope of HIPAA.

240
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,463
So, that has implications
that go in both directions.

241
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,610
In the first instance, it means that,

242
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,050
when you're engaging
vendors to provide tests,

243
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,390
employee tests, or conduct employee tests,

244
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,480
or to collect temperature checks

245
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,720
or other things that in connection

246
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,460
with this kind of activity,

247
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,420
you have to review those
vendor agreements carefully

248
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,770
because often, the vendor

249
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,880
who might be administering the test,

250
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,010
is the vendor that also engages
in HIPAA related activities.

251
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,920
And so to address, for
example, security requirements,

252
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,370
or privacy requirements,

253
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,640
the agreement might just
simply have some boiler plate

254
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,100
that says, well, we will comply

255
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,110
with applicable HIPAA requirements.

256
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,610
But that's meaningless in this context

257
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,740
because this activity widely,
isn't subject to HIPAA.

258
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,510
So there will be no
applicable HIPAA requirements.

259
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,210
And so you have no
protection as the client

260
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,090
in dealing with that vendor.

261
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,930
So you have to modify that provision,

262
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,479
to say either that they'll
comply with HIPAA requirements

263
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,970
not withstanding or irrespective
of whether HIPAA applies,

264
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,540
or a better option is to actually build in

265
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,403
specific requirements
for privacy and security.

266
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,210
And the flip side of this is that,

267
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,610
you also have less protection

268
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,970
in the event of a security
incident or a data breach,

269
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,440
because, if the information is not PHI,

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,440
that means it's not
subject to HIPAA's rituals.

271
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,210
So if there is a disclosure
of that information,

272
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,520
it's not treated as a HIPAA breach,

273
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
which actually can be good or bad.

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,050
In many cases it can be good,

275
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,479
because it means you don't have to assume

276
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,230
that notice is required
under HIPAA to the DHS,

277
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,349
HHS excuse me, to Health
and Human Services,

278
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,310
because it's not a HIPAA breach.

279
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,969
And so, it's important to understand

280
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,080
whether the data in fact
is covered by HIPAA,

281
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,070
and if it's not, it's
important to spell out

282
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,470
what steps will be taken,
if there is a breach.

283
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,980
And that's something
that should be addressed

284
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,110
both ahead of time in
your vendor agreement,

285
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,860
and also internally through your internal

286
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,160
policies and procedures.

287
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,390
We had a client not too long ago,

288
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,130
that actually experienced this,

289
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,550
where there was a breach involving
COVID testing information

290
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,359
and a lengthy dialogue ensued

291
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,190
between the client and the vendor,

292
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,720
over whether it was HIPAA reportable

293
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,930
because they did not undertake
that exercise or analysis,

294
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,660
at the time they entered
into the agreement.

295
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,530
Ultimately they concluded correctly

296
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,209
that it was not a HIPAA event,

297
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,100
that the vendor ultimately agreed.

298
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,620
And as a result, the HIPAA
security breach provisions

299
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,840
did not come into play.

300
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,020
But had they simply assumed
it was subject to HIPPA,

301
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,850
they would have gone
through that whole process

302
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,900
without need.

303
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,778
So, that's an important
thing to keep in mind.

304
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,390
Okay, what about accelerated trends?

305
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,610
Well, the obvious one is of course,

306
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,380
that the increase in remote work

307
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,460
has not surprisingly led
to increased cyber attack.

308
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,610
And I have here some examples
thrown up on the slide

309
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,610
that come from Verizon
Business and from Tessian,

310
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,500
to increase distraction,
has caused increased

311
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,563
success into cyber attacks
in particular phishing scams.

312
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,510
When I was just setting
up for this presentation,

313
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,510
I was distracted in setting up

314
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,600
because I had one of my
children calling for me,

315
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,730
and so the picture fell
off the wall, right?

316
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,829
That's the kind of thing

317
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,890
that when you're working at
the office doesn't happen

318
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,850
and in home it does.

319
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,830
And it can cause employees
to pay less careful attention

320
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,900
to what they're doing.

321
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,290
And that is in fact, I
think one of the drivers

322
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,390
of the increase successful
phishing scams that we've seen,

323
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,830
web application breaches, fit
heightened ransomware attacks,

324
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,170
the whole host of types of
increase in remote attacks

325
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,699
that are increased in cyber attacks,

326
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,340
that are resulting from
increased remote work.

327
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,440
And really what that does

328
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,590
is place a premium on continuing to do

329
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,340
what people already
should have been doing.

330
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,920
But also from a Cyber Security
Professional Perspective,

331
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,599
it really increases the importance

332
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,620
of keeping abreast the best practices.

333
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,490
Because best practices
are evolving more rapidly

334
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,323
than they did before.

335
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:59,060
It was already a dynamic
phenomenon to begin with.

336
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,589
And now, that's increasing.

337
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:03,910
What was best practices six months ago,

338
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,579
is not best practices today.

339
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,830
And so it's important for the
cybersecurity professional

340
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,100
to know that and to keep up to date,

341
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,190
so that they can continue to maintain

342
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,450
a reasonable approach
towards cybersecurity.

343
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,070
And reasonableness is important

344
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,930
because many of, there
are more and more federal

345
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,319
and state regulatory requirements,

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,770
that adopt a reasonable sTANDARDS,

347
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,560
and you have to have a
reasonable WISPs of course,

348
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,989
Written Information Security Program.

349
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,860
A reasonable WISPs in place,

350
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,320
and reasonableness often
turns in part anyway

351
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,190
when industry best practices

352
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,460
and on the foreseeability of risks.

353
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,047
Now, of course in the HIPPA context,

354
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,730
there are specific and very granular

355
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,900
cybersecurity requirements,

356
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,730
that's also true, for example,

357
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,210
in the New York DFS cyber
security regulation,

358
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,650
which applies to financial
services companies

359
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,290
that are licensed by the New York

360
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,910
Department of Financial Services.

361
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,839
But that's not generally the case.

362
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,660
When you're talking about
the vulnerable Massachusetts

363
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,069
data security law that has been in place

364
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,790
for many years, for example,

365
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,599
or the more recent CCPA,
California Consumer Privacy Act

366
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,900
and its successor, the
California Privacy Rights Act

367
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,260
which will take effect in 2023,

368
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,740
they talk more in terms of reasonableness,

369
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,690
and certainly the Federal Trade Commission

370
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,330
and looking at data security
looks at reasonableness

371
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,000
and explicitly as it
looks at it in the context

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,890
of industry best practices
among other things.

373
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,090
So what does this mean?

374
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,210
What are the implications here?

375
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,490
Well, as I mentioned, number
one, is it really requires

376
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,600
keeping abreast of what
the industry is doing.

377
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,300
Knowing what your competitors
and peer companies are doing.

378
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,180
It also really requires
increased communication

379
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,930
between IT operations, which
is continuing to roll out

380
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,040
newer and better remote working solutions,

381
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,760
and info security.

382
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,490
As each business process changes,

383
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,450
InfoSec needs to be in the loop.

384
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,470
They need to be in the loop early,

385
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,750
so that they can understand and facilitate

386
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,083
the implementation of those solutions.

387
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,260
InfoSec is never successful
if it is always saying no,

388
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,060
or always slowing things down.

389
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,640
It really needs to help facilitate,

390
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,660
but the way you can help
facilitate responsibly,

391
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,969
is by being involved early in the process.

392
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,660
In addition, I would suspect

393
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,360
that almost every company data maps

394
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,520
may be out of date by
now, if they predate COVID

395
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,630
because, where data is being kept,

396
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,130
and how it's being handled, has changed.

397
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,040
And so updating data mapping is important

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,160
because without good data
mapping, it's hard to know,

399
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,360
whether you have vulnerabilities

400
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,270
that you haven't identified.

401
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,810
Increasing training, especially phishing

402
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,760
around phishing with your user base,

403
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,510
continually reminding them

404
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,689
of the importance of being vigilant.

405
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,970
Using simulated phishing,
those kinds of things,

406
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,890
which already are things that
should have been in place.

407
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,960
And from I'm sure many
companies already were in place,

408
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,960
need to be reinforced
and made more frequent.

409
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,530
Hence my comment that these
are accelerating trends.

410
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,990
In addition, hardening resilience.

411
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,260
I would hazard that,

412
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,510
most business continuity
disaster recovery plans

413
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,609
were not predicated on
indeterminate remote work

414
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,929
and that's really what
we are living with today.

415
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,520
And so making sure that those plans

416
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,700
that were designed for a
very different environment

417
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,200
are still useful in that end,

418
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,270
and sufficient today is really important.

419
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,453
And then lastly,

420
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,730
updating and revisiting your
incident response procedures,

421
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,030
to make sure that they make sense,

422
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,940
that they still fit with
what you're trying to do

423
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,230
in today's environment.

424
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,890
Is important because in
a distributed workforce

425
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,820
when no one is in the same location,

426
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,379
and there're multiple responsible parties,

427
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,150
an incident response program

428
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,440
that may have made sense a year ago,

429
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,820
may not make sense today.

430
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,070
and so that's really
important to understand.

431
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,270
Speaking of data breaches,
there's also another development

432
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,510
that's not related to COVID,

433
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,320
but is coincidence with the timing

434
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,433
that I think is worth talking about.

435
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,950
And it arises out of a court decision

436
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,750
this past summer in Virginia,

437
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,700
in connection with the Capital One breach,

438
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,090
where the court ordered Capital One

439
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,000
to disclose its forensic report.

440
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,430
And that was shocking to many,

441
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,990
because the forensic report

442
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,770
has been regarded often as privileged,

443
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,090
of protected under the attorney
work product privilege.

444
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,189
And in fact, that's the
position the Cap One

445
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,500
took in that case.

446
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,730
The court said, no, it was not,

447
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,390
and required that it be disclosed

448
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,760
to plaintiffs in the class action

449
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,770
that was filed in
connection with the breach.

450
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,393
So what are the lessons
that one learns from this?

451
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,880
Number one, it's not sufficient
to have counsel involved

452
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,500
in the forensic process.

453
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,030
Instead, you should retain
the vendor through counsel.

454
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,190
So that if counsel had that as retained

455
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,750
and as responsible for the vendor.

456
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,680
Now, many companies have
pre-existing relationships

457
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,270
with vendors.

458
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,260
They might have a flat
fee, kind of arrangement

459
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
an ongoing counseling arrangement,

460
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,050
something along those lines.

461
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,930
And that's the vendor that they
wanna use for the forensic,

462
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,770
report in the case of an
incident, that's totally fine.

463
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,480
But what you need to do in that case

464
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,370
is enter into a special statement of work

465
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,959
or project schedule for this project.

466
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,290
And this particular SOW,

467
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,670
will be between counsel and the vendor,

468
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,040
even if it's governed by the terms

469
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,690
of the Master Services Agreement.

470
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,330
And they're very clear that
that work is gonna be conducted

471
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,990
under the protection of
privilege, that's number one.

472
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,250
But that's not enough.

473
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,070
Number two, counsel really
needs to be involved

474
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,679
in a meaningful way,

475
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,060
in directing and shaping
the investigation.

476
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,220
It can't simply be you'd cc them

477
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,280
on your emails to the vendor.

478
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,800
And of course, really at least
if they follow the Cap One,

479
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,480
precedent, we'll be looking more closely

480
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,780
at that kind of thing.

481
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,440
And ensuring that in fact,
council played a real role.

482
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,900
Number three, well, I'm must
get number three on the slide.

483
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,310
I'll come back to that,
and then number four

484
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,700
and then I'll go back to three.

485
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,870
So number four, the report
really has to reflect

486
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,560
legal involvement.

487
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,600
And by that, what I mean is,

488
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,370
what the court and Cap One
said was, among other things,

489
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,760
this report is the same report
that would have been written

490
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,610
if counsel had never been involved.

491
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,300
And so there's really no impact

492
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,500
from a council's involvement

493
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,310
other than to try to claim privilege.

494
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,110
And that's not what attorney
work product is intended to do.

495
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,209
Attorney work product, is work
product directed by counsel,

496
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,440
prepared in anticipation of
litigation or investigation.

497
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,310
And so it needs to reflect,

498
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,040
and this is my editorial
addition to what the court said,

499
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,790
it needs to reflect that
legal direction or input.

500
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,850
There's something about
the report on its face,

501
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,649
should reflect the fact that counsel

502
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,940
was involved in directing and shaping it.

503
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,940
And so, that's I think
very often overlooked

504
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,350
and very important.

505
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,709
It's not a new requirement.

506
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,920
It's not something that Federal Court

507
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,190
and the Cap One case created.

508
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,170
It's always been the standard.

509
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,410
It just hasn't always been
applied so rigorously.

510
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,820
And I think moving into a
post Cap One environment,

511
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,010
it very well could be.

512
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,850
And so that's something
important to keep in mind.

513
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,070
And then lastly, going
up to my third bullet,

514
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,159
you really should decide
what you really need

515
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,810
to be written down.

516
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,490
There's a reflexive tendency

517
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,590
to wanna have everything in writing.

518
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,510
And vendors like to do it,

519
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,080
because they could show all
the beautiful work they did

520
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,300
and the thoroughness and
comprehensiveness of their report.

521
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,520
And the clients often make it

522
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,560
because they have something
they can refer to.

523
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,220
But the problem is, is
that you create a record

524
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,410
that you may not need.

525
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,050
There may be a whole host of
findings in the forensic report

526
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,240
that are unrelated to the
incident, or that are immaterial

527
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,230
but that nonetheless show up findings.

528
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,860
And if you then don't address each one,

529
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,209
and instead leave some open,

530
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,520
which may be a very reasonable decision,

531
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,050
then in the future if there's a litigation

532
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,919
in connection let's say
with another incident,

533
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,820
and this report gets disclosed,

534
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,290
you're gonna have a lot
of explaining to do.

535
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,923
And it's gonna create
unnecessary suspicion

536
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,929
about the adequacy of your
information security efforts.

537
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,640
And so, really thinking hard

538
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,050
on what you need to be
in writing, is important.

539
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,659
And even if you decide, yes,
we do need a written report,

540
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,760
and you decide what it should have in it,

541
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,040
that should be conveyed orally

542
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,139
in a conference with the
vendor and the client,

543
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,870
before anything gets written down.

544
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,879
So you can make sure that
everybody's on the same page

545
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,910
as to what the report will contain.

546
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,430
And then when the report is drafted,

547
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,400
it should be set in draft
form to counsel first,

548
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,390
to make sure that again,

549
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,080
it reflects the
expectations of the parties,

550
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,480
before it is finalized.

551
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,370
So it requires a very
deliberative process.

552
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,659
It's certainly doable.

553
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,380
There's nothing about the
capital indecision that says,

554
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,980
forensic reports can never be privileged,

555
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,283
but it requires thought.

556
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,693
Okay, ransomware.

557
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:58,360
Ransomware is, as everyone knows,

558
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,679
a increasingly common type of attack.

559
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,460
I just wanna mention
one thing briefly here.

560
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,770
Again, this is not a
COVID related phenomenon

561
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,290
but it's coincident with
it in terms of timing.

562
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,070
In October of this past year,

563
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,770
OFAC insert a ransomware advisory.

564
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,510
Now the advisory basically
just restated existing law,

565
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,500
which is that if you do business with,

566
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,000
which includes making the
payment to a sanctioned party,

567
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,133
a person who is listed on
OFAC list of that people,

568
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,040
then you're violating OFAC sanctions.

569
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,300
And it's a strict liability standard,

570
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,600
meaning you don't have to
know the person is sanctioned.

571
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,409
If you simply make the payment
or engage in the transaction

572
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,930
with that person, then you
have potential liability.

573
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,720
And that's really all
OFAC's advisory says.

574
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,010
And that always true.

575
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,480
And then all OFAC goes on to say,

576
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,670
and if you seek a license,
meaning you discover

577
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,010
that the ransomware attacker
is a sanctioned party

578
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,950
and you wanna make the payment anyway,

579
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,490
and so you come to OFAC
for a license to do so

580
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,820
which is what you would need,

581
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,240
there's gonna be a presumption of denial.

582
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,160
We're gonna present the
way we're telling you,

583
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,720
you're gonna have a
really high burden to show

584
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
before we're gonna allow
that payment to be made.

585
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,770
Meaning we're probably
gonna deny the request.

586
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,980
So what does that do?

587
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,210
It puts companies that are
victims of ransomware attacks

588
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,690
in a very hard position.

589
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,380
Because number one, you almost never know

590
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,450
who the attacker is.

591
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,590
So you don't know whether
they're a sanctioned party

592
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,840
or if they're in a sanctioned country

593
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,800
like Iran or Cuba or Syria,

594
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,129
you don't know anything about
them, that's the whole point.

595
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,090
They require payment
through cryptocurrencies.

596
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,679
And it's two addresses that
you can't really track.

597
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,740
So you don't know.

598
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,570
And so then you run the risk
of, okay do we make the payment

599
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,950
and risk later finding out
or having it be discovered

600
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,650
that the party was a sanctioned party,

601
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,760
or do you not make the payment

602
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,604
for fear of violating the sanctions?

603
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,290
All that doesn't give you
any help in that regard.

604
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,470
And it's not surprising,

605
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,220
the government generally
has not been supportive

606
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,910
of making ransomware payments,

607
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,200
but it's something companies
need to make and keep in mind

608
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,310
and decide how they're going
to address ahead of time.

609
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,120
Obviously the best position to be in is,

610
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,820
you don't need the access to the data

611
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,740
that's been ransomed,

612
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,150
because, or that's been interdicted
because you have backups

613
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,340
but you need to have a policy in place

614
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,100
for how you're going to deal
ransomware attacks proactively.

615
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,250
Okay, last thing, so I'm
running short on time,

616
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,480
again, not COVID related
but coincidence and timing.

617
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,020
Hong Kong, the reason
I mentioned Hong Kong

618
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,660
is it's been on the minds
of many of my clients.

619
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,760
For many years, many of
them with Asia operations

620
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,460
relied on Hong Kong as
a data center location

621
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,790
for a number of reasons,
including convenience,

622
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,340
availability of bandwidth,
inter transpacific connections.

623
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,840
And they were comfortable doing so

624
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,639
because Hong Kong was separately
administered from China.

625
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,650
As I'm sure all of you
know, from the news,

626
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,030
that's really no longer the case.

627
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,440
China has extended its
national security authority

628
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,990
over Hong Kong.

629
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,970
Meaning that Hong Kong locations

630
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,800
really announced subjects
Chinese surveillance,

631
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,597
and Chinese process just as if
they were in Mainland China.

632
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,900
And that really creates a
significant security issue

633
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,100
for companies to consider.

634
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,110
Many of them have considered relocate,

635
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,860
have actually started already
relocating data center assets

636
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,959
out of Hong Kong to
other locations in Asia,

637
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,800
most commonly Tokyo.

638
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,399
I'm not an IT person, but my understanding

639
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,830
is Tokyo also is blessed

640
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,429
with a large number of transpacific,

641
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,040
direct transpacific connections,

642
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,540
whereas other locations
such as Singapore or Soul,

643
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,120
often go through Hong Kong,

644
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,179
and so you still have similar problem.

645
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,380
But figuring that out is important.

646
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,010
And it's also important to the extent

647
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,640
that you don't relocate, or
even if or if you're not able to

648
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,130
because you're gonna have Hong
Kong presence of some kind,

649
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,650
and that is developing or if
you have already revisiting

650
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,400
your internal escalation procedure

651
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,220
on what your folks on
the ground should do,

652
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,820
if they're served with a government order

653
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,830
to turn over data, turn over records.

654
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,129
How to state an objection, how not to?

655
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,230
It's not necessary nor is it appropriate

656
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,840
to require your employees
to put themselves

657
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,100
at risk of arrest,

658
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,250
but there are ways they can
nonetheless create a record

659
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,490
that they objected to a
particular search or seizure,

660
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,650
whether they can follow investigators

661
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,910
as they go through an office
and collect materials,

662
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,623
keep a record of what was taken,

663
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,460
whom they should alert internally,
when they're approached.

664
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,420
There should be an escalation,

665
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,740
immediate escalation procedures

666
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,860
that your person on the
ground in Hong Kong knows,

667
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,500
who to call or who to email,

668
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,210
when they approached by the government,

669
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,410
so that the company can
take appropriate steps.

670
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,870
Those kinds of written procedures

671
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,350
which companies have
multi jurisdictionally,

672
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,199
should be really reviewed
in the Hong Kong context,

673
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,080
with an eye toward Chinese,

674
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,053
and Hong Kong specific considerations.

675
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,700
Okay, so what are our action?

676
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,160
What's our recap from what I talked about?

677
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,970
So what should people be doing today?

678
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,590
Review your reopening protocols.

679
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,010
Hopefully we all will be reopening soon.

680
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,900
Understand what kind of
data you're collecting,

681
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,160
how you protect it, ask
question, challenge.

682
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,250
Do we need these data?

683
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,750
Do we really need to
collect this information?

684
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,000
Review your ransomware response procedures

685
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,160
so that you know how
you're going to address,

686
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,270
payment demands,

687
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,740
and have thought carefully
about the OFAC issue

688
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,250
that was identified in the advisory.

689
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,850
OFAC is making clear
this is important to it,

690
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,959
and so it needs to be important to you

691
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,600
in terms of at least
how you think about it.

692
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,219
In the coming weeks, and really already,

693
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,290
in many cases, companies are
doing this and should be,

694
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,363
consider ways to minimize your
data exposure to Hong Kong,

695
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:29,700
and every day really review your

696
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,910
information security
protocols and programs,

697
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,430
it's more important than
ever to keep up to speed

698
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,670
with what your peer companies are doing,

699
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,770
and to ensure that your
security precautions

700
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,800
have adapted to the changed circumstances

701
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,879
in which we live and work today.

702
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,270
And which will almost certainly
continue in some measure,

703
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,290
even post pandemic.

704
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,040
And that's it, thank you very much.
