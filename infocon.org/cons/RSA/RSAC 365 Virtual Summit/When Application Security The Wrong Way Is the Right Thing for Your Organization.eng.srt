00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,963
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:04,870
Welcome to my RSA 365 talk called,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,380
when application security "the wrong way"

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,219
is the right thing for your organization.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Jennifer Czaplewski

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm the Director of the Product Security

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,420
for Target Corporation.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,630
And today we're gonna
talk about some myths

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,610
in the application security space

10
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,790
and ways that Target went
a different direction

11
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,680
and busted those myths.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,360
This is a bit of a reprisal
from a talk that I gave

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,200
at RSA when we were in
person in February of 2020.

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,860
And following this talk
will be a moderated Q&A

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,790
with Caroline Wong,

16
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,923
who's head of strategy and HR Cobalt IO.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,410
So before we get into some myth-busting,

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,120
let's back up and just talk
a little bit about Target

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,809
and our IT environments.

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,950
So Target is a fortune 30 retailer.

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,000
We are based in Minneapolis, Minnesota

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,921
which is where I'm
coming to you from today.

23
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,542
We have 350,000 team
members across the world.

24
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,420
Our stores are in the US

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,110
but we have team members
really across the globe.

26
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,490
And if you shop at a Target store,

27
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,300
you might know some of
these things about Target.

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,009
But what you might not know about Target

29
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,350
is how critical technology has become

30
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,259
to our daily operations.

31
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,020
Things like order pickup, or drive up

32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,393
or paying with your app using
the Target mobile wallet

33
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:20,640
or our partnership with
Shipt for same day delivery.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
All of those things,

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,420
weren't sort of decided by some folks

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,250
who are working in business
roles and thrown over the wall

37
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,530
to the IT team,

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,821
our it team partners with
our business team members,

39
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,520
every day to come up with innovative ways

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,140
that Target can best serve our guests.

41
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:41,280
And in order to be that really valuable

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,900
and skilled partner for
Target's business teams,

43
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,250
our IT organization went through

44
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,370
a pretty significant
transformation in 2015.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,060
Prior to our transformation,

46
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,100
we were a really project
heavy, vendor heavy,

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,969
contractor heavy organization.

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,669
And in our transformation,

49
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,632
we adopted the product methodology

50
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:03,674
agile and DevOps delivery mechanisms.

51
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,610
We brought in a lot of engineering talent

52
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,630
and started developing a
lot of what we use every day

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,949
in-house.

54
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,250
And in order to make that work,

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,920
we really had to focus on
innovation and skill development.

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,359
So at Target, we have a program
called '50 Days of Learning'

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,800
and it's basically a literal title.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,310
Every IT team member is
expected to spend 50 days a year

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,742
or about one day a week,

60
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:29,144
developing and enhancing and building new

61
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:31,340
and continuing to develop their IT skills

62
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,663
to be that valued partner
with our business teams.

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,940
So now that you know a
little bit about Target

64
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,020
and you know a little bit about
how our it operation runs,

65
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,670
let's get to myth-busting.

66
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,780
And the first myth that
we'd be talking about

67
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,930
is that there's no single metric

68
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,360
to measure application security.

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,100
So I've been in an application
security role for five years

70
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,329
and I've heard this myth
quite a few different times

71
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,980
while I've been working in AppSec.

72
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,890
And it's an interesting question.

73
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,429
How do we help teams understand
their security posture?

74
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,780
Some options that I've seen
in different organizations

75
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,300
are security test coverage,

76
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,350
so what coverage of tests do
we have on our applications

77
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,140
or on the code that we have,

78
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,200
people have thought about using
defects, security defects,

79
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,602
per lines of code.

80
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,430
Target adopted historically

81
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,897
how fast teams are
resolving security issues

82
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:26,077
and that worked for a while

83
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,160
on some of the ways that we
were able to incentivize teams

84
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,766
to think more seriously about security,

85
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,750
but all of those things require you

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,980
to really understand a
lot of things outside,

87
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,695
just the security of your application.

88
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,100
And so we thought,

89
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,700
is there a way that we can
better serve our IT partners

90
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,313
with how to measure application security?

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,880
So in 2017, we launched a system called

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,220
Product Intelligence.

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
And Product Intelligence,

94
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,206
pulls a lot of different
security data together

95
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,200
and the first thing that you'll notice

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,649
when you log into the
Product Intelligence system

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,800
is that it gives a product
team, a single number.

98
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,070
This number ranges on the low end,

99
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,390
from 300 to the highest it can be as 850.

100
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,809
And that scale mimics the same scale

101
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,500
that you would see in like
a personal credit score.

102
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,410
But really the scale between

103
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,050
the low and high end
numbers for the credit score

104
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,120
is where we differ from
a personal credit score

105
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,730
with this Product Intelligence score.

106
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,670
We are very transparent.

107
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,833
Every single element, every single point,

108
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,380
is very clear to product teams

109
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,170
for what makes up their score.

110
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,740
So this is a fake product.

111
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,573
If you zoom in,

112
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,930
you can see that this product
is called Fakeasaurus Rex

113
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,020
We don't have a product at
Target called Fakeasaurus Rex

114
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,780
so we might someday.

115
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,609
And Fakeasaurus Rex with the fake data

116
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,210
that we've plugged in here has a 751.

117
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,130
So what's very easy for a
product team to understand is,

118
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,850
in summary how am I doing

119
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,410
from a product security perspective?

120
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,400
And this number is made up
of four different categories.

121
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,748
The first category,

122
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,400
these are the range between 300 and 850.

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,880
The first grouping is called
findings and vulnerabilities.

124
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,810
And that makes up 45% of the score.

125
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,310
What we measure in the findings
and vulnerability space,

126
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,030
is not how many findings you have

127
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,039
or how many vulnerabilities you have.

128
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,140
What we measure is,

129
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,070
for each of the findings
and vulnerabilities

130
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,520
that products have,

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,940
are they meeting the commitments

132
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,580
that the team committed to
for closing those findings

133
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,450
or addressing those vulnerabilities.

134
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,229
So if you have 10 findings

135
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,240
and you've closed nine of them on time,

136
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,940
then you get a 90% for this findings

137
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,450
in vulnerability category

138
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,229
and you're probably gonna
have a pretty high score

139
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,630
for that section.

140
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,478
So the first category findings
and vulnerabilities measures

141
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:40,930
are they closing findings,
according to the schedule

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,560
that the product teams themselves set?

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,440
The second category at
35% is security services.

144
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,580
And what we measure here is,

145
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,488
are you using the security services

146
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:53,310
that the security team
has deemed important?

147
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,330
For example, if you have
findings from a pen test

148
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,270
that's 45% of your findings
or 45% of your score

149
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,217
but we really want to make
sure that teams don't avoid

150
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:03,930
the pen test entirely.

151
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,230
So 35% of it is,

152
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,880
are you doing the pen
test that you needed to?

153
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,830
Or are you building out the risk register

154
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,300
and using those security
services that are important

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,683
for the security of products?

156
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,510
The last 20% of the score is split evenly

157
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,200
between security culture,

158
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,950
which makes up 10% and
essentially measures,

159
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,159
are product teams doing
the cultural things

160
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,310
that we want them to do to
have good software security.

161
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,250
And in this case,

162
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,850
do you have a security Ninja

163
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,460
and is your Ninja doing the
things that we want them

164
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,450
to just to do.

165
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,409
And lastly, sort of the ultimate measure

166
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,950
of any application security posture,

167
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,650
have you been the root
cause of an security event

168
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,219
or incident in the last 12 months?

169
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,577
So the score 751 kind of
measures all of those things,

170
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:51,550
and that's an important tool

171
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,798
for everyone to have clear information

172
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,070
about how they stand.

173
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,940
But what's incredibly important,

174
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,850
and the most important
secret source of this system,

175
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,580
is the actions to take.

176
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,930
We don't just tell teams you're 751

177
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,110
and here's all the ways
that that was made up

178
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,900
but we tell them for 39 more points,

179
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,870
there's some scope in
your killer application

180
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,320
that hasn't been pen tested.

181
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,510
You have 26 points that you could gain

182
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,580
by closing some security findings.

183
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,190
You have some critical
endpoint vulnerabilities

184
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,080
that need to be addressed.

185
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,099
So this specific actions to take

186
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,930
is where we really empower
teams to take the steps

187
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,330
to better improve the
security of their product.

188
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,950
Some other elements that you
might notice on the score is

189
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,969
the relativity.

190
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,900
So we also show teams your 751,

191
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,058
here's the actions but
here's how you compare

192
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,080
to other products at Target.

193
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,669
And this one has been really powerful

194
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,340
to have good conversations.

195
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,659
When we launched the system in 2017,

196
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,290
I sat down with a peer
and walked her through,

197
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,990
here's your system and you're at a 650

198
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,480
and here's the actions you should take.

199
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
And she was, "Yep, sounds good."

200
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,100
But when we talked about the product rank,

201
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,670
and at that time this
product was in the bottom 10%

202
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,910
of all products,

203
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,757
the conversation changed and she's like,

204
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:05,880
"Oh that can't be true,

205
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,280
we take security very seriously."

206
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,599
And it allowed me to have
a really good conversation

207
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,870
about how we actually
consider and measure security.

208
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,980
So this relativity is good
for all of us type A folks

209
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,130
who feel strongly about
being in the top 20 or 10%,

210
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,593
compared to other products.

211
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,610
And the last information that
you can see on the first page

212
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,170
is the historical trend.

213
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,750
We want to compare teams
not only to everyone else,

214
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,010
but to themselves.

215
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,509
And it's not uncommon
when we're in the office.

216
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,120
that we aren't currently,

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,480
to walk around the floors
and see different teams,

218
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,470
sort of talking about the
trends of their PI score

219
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,599
on their team whiteboards

220
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,610
and celebrating when
they've hit thresholds

221
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,560
that they're trying to do.

222
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,863
So this is the main page.

223
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,470
As you continue to go through the system,

224
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,830
I've mentioned transparency,

225
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,500
and that's a really important element.

226
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,248
In order for people to trust
that this data is accurate

227
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,220
and that they should take the actions

228
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,970
that we are asking them to,

229
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,080
we give them every
element, every source data,

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,090
we show them everything about their system

231
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,720
so that they can see what they need to do

232
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,660
and in context of all of the other things.

233
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,510
Well, one of the things

234
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,959
that we're also trying to do is,

235
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,130
not just require our
product team counterparts

236
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,960
to go to the system all the
time and pull down information,

237
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,930
we try to meet teams where they work.

238
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,459
So we offer integrations
with GitHub and Jira backlogs

239
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,150
as well as email notifications.

240
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,160
People can sign up

241
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,060
and be notified when certain
things change about the score

242
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,940
and they can download all of the findings

243
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,390
or the actions that they need to take

244
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,040
into their team backlogs,

245
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,868
so they can prioritize security work

246
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,040
alongside all of the other
features and functions

247
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,490
that they're trying to offer.

248
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,020
When I see all of this data
together for Fakeasaurus Rex

249
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,646
it's really helpful to
see everything together

250
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:53,490
but let me just kind of
rewind and paint for you all

251
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,740
what it was like before
we had a system like this.

252
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,610
So prior to 2017,

253
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,310
we had entire teams of security analysts

254
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,410
whose job was to go into the GRC system

255
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,011
on a weekly or monthly basis,

256
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,900
pull all of the information out,

257
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,970
consolidated into spreadsheets,

258
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,401
send those spreadsheets over to the teams,

259
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:15,609
go back and forth with them about actions

260
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,130
that needed to be taken.

261
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,170
And we stayed for years

262
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,199
and believe then that product teams

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,690
are responsible and accountable

264
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,460
for the security of their products

265
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,010
but in reality, they couldn't
get to any of the data.

266
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,900
They really had to work
through the security team

267
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,329
to make a lot of changes.

268
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,184
So in reality we created a system where,

269
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,839
the security team had more accountability

270
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,770
than the product team.

271
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,290
And that's been a really
big shift with the system.

272
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,160
The ability for product
teams to take accountability,

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,910
for the security of their products.

274
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,120
Not too long after we
launched the product view,

275
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,962
the leaders of those particular systems

276
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,700
asked for summarized information,

277
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,120
And that's been really helpful as well

278
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,520
to drive changes within our teams.

279
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,962
So not only can leaders see the scores

280
00:10:56,962 --> 00:11:00,480
for the different systems
that they're responsible for,

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,680
but they can also see trend information.

282
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,130
How are we doing on pen testing?

283
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,260
How are we doing in point vulnerabilities?

284
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,290
We have sections that talk
about security coding flaws

285
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,099
that happen within their portfolios.

286
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,440
And we've been able to target
each portfolio or teams

287
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,740
with specific training opportunities,

288
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,750
based on trends that they see

289
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,530
in the different sections here.

290
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,780
And it's just been really
valuable to, again,

291
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,910
put that accountability back into teams

292
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,189
and they can make some decisions

293
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,970
about where they want to invest.

294
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,690
It also lets leaders
understand sort of over time

295
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,523
how are we doing?

296
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,150
Are we better or worse than
we were three months ago,

297
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,163
six months ago?

298
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,610
So if any of this sounds interesting

299
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,310
and you wanted to build
something like this

300
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,919
within your own organization.

301
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,960
When we started,

302
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,673
we had two or three folks
working on a system,

303
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,470
we have more now

304
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,480
but when we started, we
kind of started small

305
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
and we had just few people working on it.

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,709
We used open source technology
as much as possible.

307
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,160
So the screenshots that
I was showing earlier,

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,829
those are a product called Superset

309
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,520
which is an open source technology

310
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,900
that you can use for tables and graphing.

311
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,829
And we rely primarily on
source systems to give us data.

312
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,950
So we connect via API to all
these different source systems

313
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,100
and then the secret source

314
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,550
of the product intelligence
system is putting

315
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,010
that information together.

316
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,520
So a product team can see it

317
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,579
and really translating
all of that to actions

318
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,550
that we want folks to take.

319
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,362
From a prerequisites perspective,

320
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,689
some things that we had
to get in place before

321
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,290
we were able to take this step

322
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,824
with product intelligence was,

323
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:35,185
at least a basic understanding
of the assets that you have.

324
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,010
What systems, what software do you have

325
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,934
and pulling that information together.

326
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,010
A policy was really helpful.

327
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,220
So nothing in the product
intelligence system is new.

328
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,130
It's all things that are already included

329
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,740
in the security policy.

330
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
We're just being more transparent about

331
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,410
what we expect of product teams to do.

332
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,329
So we're pulling that together

333
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,380
for them to look at.

334
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,790
And last you can have all of the numbers

335
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,151
and the actions and the things
that you can pull together.

336
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:06,070
But without a lot of commitment
from the organization,

337
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,810
it's just another metric.

338
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,390
From our CIO on down,

339
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,250
the PI score, the PI actions

340
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,640
are something that teams care about

341
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,610
and their leaders care about

342
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,940
and we talk about on a regular basis.

343
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,324
All right,

344
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,500
we're going to bust another myth

345
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,490
and that is to welcome
any and all engineers

346
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,474
to a Security Guild, but are
still mandate participation.

347
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,850
So why is this concept even important?

348
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,410
Well, at Target, we have 4,500 developers,

349
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,420
spanning across 200 product teams

350
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,069
and our security team needed to find a way

351
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,220
to be everywhere at once.

352
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,270
And so looking at the industry,

353
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,720
there's lots of organizations
that have programs like this.

354
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,830
They could be called security champions,

355
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,340
or advocates or security Ninjas.

356
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,210
That's the term that we
landed on for our program,

357
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,050
but where our program differs

358
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,699
from other programs that you might see

359
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,550
is that ours is not a
tiered system for learning

360
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,349
where everyone participates

361
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,110
and you start as a lower
belt and move your way

362
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,340
up the program.

363
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,000
Our hypothesis in 2016

364
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,017
is that if we created a
program that was exclusive

365
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,140
and somewhat prestigious,

366
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,650
we could get the right people

367
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,850
who are going to be the most engaged

368
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,680
and could have the better chance

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,920
to actually permeate the
culture of the organization.

370
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,829
We landed on the term security Ninjas

371
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,610
because who we're looking
for in this program

372
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,833
are people who are nimble
and at the top of their game.

373
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,680
And the thought, when
we launched the program

374
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,109
and has proven true, is
that with a smaller group,

375
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,056
we can create a more curated program.

376
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:38,230
We can be more transparent
about the security threats

377
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,300
that we're facing,

378
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,300
we can have more meaningful
trainings and offer better swag,

379
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,209
T-shirts, IT tchotchke
that can go on your desk.

380
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,320
So let's talk a little bit
about Target's exclusive

381
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,250
Security Ninja Program.

382
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,020
So we are looking for
participants in the program

383
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,939
that are seasoned,
influential and passionate.

384
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,600
And what we really mean here are,

385
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,440
the individuals that are influential,

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,854
when they talk their team listens.

387
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,287
We also want folks who are
passionate about security

388
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,470
and want to be here.

389
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,070
At my organization we have this
concept of being voluntold.

390
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,470
I personally have been voluntold
for a great many things

391
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,280
over the years, and we don't want anybody

392
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,400
who's voluntold to be in this program.

393
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,050
We want you to be excited

394
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,459
and to really want to make a difference

395
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,963
in the security posture
of your team's product.

396
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,333
The program itself I've
mentioned, exclusive.

397
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,759
We set a ceiling that no more than 5%

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,900
of the tech population can
be part of the program.

399
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,720
So at 4,500 people,

400
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,740
that's about 225 Ninjas at any time.

401
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,530
We're currently at 170,

402
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,603
so we're still underneath that ceiling.

403
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,210
Their primary goal is to
build security awareness

404
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,260
and excitement within their teams

405
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,639
and what the program has actually become,

406
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,770
even though we didn't set out to make this

407
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,120
is that it's been an
accidental talent pipeline

408
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,130
for the security organization.

409
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,910
Every year in the five years
that we've had this program

410
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,622
between five and eight
people who are developers

411
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:06,810
in product teams get so excited

412
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,319
until interested in the
security work that we're doing,

413
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,920
they leave their development teams

414
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,367
and join the security team.

415
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,380
So that's been very exciting,

416
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,160
in a world where security
talent is so hard to find,

417
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,219
to have created this
accidental talent pipeline

418
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,373
was exciting and surprising for us.

419
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,319
So what does it mean
to be a security Ninja?

420
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,300
That first means,

421
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,390
that if you're an extension
of the security team,

422
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,223
we don't at least like you

423
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,449
to have some basic security knowledge.

424
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,360
So the first responsibility is to build

425
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,920
and then maintain that security knowledge.

426
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,363
The second responsibility

427
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,810
and probably the largest elements
of being a security Ninja

428
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,650
is to guide your teams and
security best practice.

429
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,010
So don't just take in
a bunch of information,

430
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,680
but really use that
information that you've learned

431
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,829
to guide your teams in doing things

432
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,633
in the most secure, possible way.

433
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,670
A very small but important element

434
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,030
of the security Ninja program

435
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,630
is to maintain the
application inventory data

436
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,370
that usually just means nudging teams

437
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,579
to populate the risk register.

438
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,899
And the last element that's
very important for us

439
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,999
is that they are a voice of
customer for the InfoSec team.

440
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,800
Our security Ninjas know
what we're trying to do

441
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,139
but they sit organizationally
with their product teams.

442
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,180
And so they can help
us gauge whether or not

443
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,980
the things that we're trying to do,

444
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,722
actually are landing the
way that we think they are,

445
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:26,260
they give us really great input on ways

446
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,350
that we can improve the
services that we offer.

447
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,469
Ninjas agree when they join the program

448
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,820
to spend about 20% of their
time doing these things.

449
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,653
And as I've mentioned,

450
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:39,220
we consider them an extension
of the security team.

451
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,996
They are absolutely empowered
to make security decisions

452
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,250
within their teams,

453
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,240
as long as they don't
violate security policy.

454
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,020
And these are the basic four things

455
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,480
that all the security Ninjas,

456
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,360
all 170 people have agreed to do.

457
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,800
But what we've seen is
because we've chosen people

458
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,320
who are very engaged, very passionate,

459
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,550
the right folks who really wanna be here,

460
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,120
is that they go above and
beyond this list so many times.

461
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,270
In the last 12 months,

462
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,560
we have Ryan he's a Ninja
and our point of sales system

463
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,003
who recognized that our static
scanner, our SAST system

464
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:15,370
was not covering languages

465
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,050
that they used for some
of the functionality

466
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,560
in our point of sale system.

467
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,140
So he researched and
implemented an augmentation

468
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,080
that we then plugged
into our static scanner,

469
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,689
that covered languages that they used

470
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,410
within our point of sale.

471
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,390
We have Mohit in our Bangalore office

472
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,060
who liked what we were doing
with product intelligence,

473
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,510
but recognize that it might
not cover all of the things

474
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,160
that he wanted to measure for the systems

475
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
that he was responsible for.

476
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,250
So he had an entire
augmentation library of things

477
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,570
that he wanted to also be looking at

478
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,240
in terms of measurements for the systems

479
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,210
that he was responsible for.

480
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,340
These are two examples,

481
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,909
but we see our Ninjas doing
stuff like this all the time.

482
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,570
And that's how we're really excited

483
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,330
to have those right individuals

484
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,370
who really want to be here

485
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,270
and make meaningful change in the Org.

486
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,770
So what does it mean to have
that knowledge development?

487
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,690
We do want people to be
making informed decisions

488
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,320
when they're out doing that.

489
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,850
And the first thing is when you
are nominated by your leader

490
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,080
and then accepted to
come into the program,

491
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,909
you start with initial onboarding.

492
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,176
And that usually is 90 minutes
of security fundamentals,

493
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:21,149
followed by a three-hour
hands-on hacking course

494
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,610
where we use an intentionally
vulnerable web app

495
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,664
that you can get from many open source,

496
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,286
like the OWASP Juice Shop is what we use.

497
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,120
And we walk them through some of the ways

498
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,820
that vulnerable websites
can actually have an impact

499
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,100
to the organization.

500
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
And we see that that
hands-on hacking class,

501
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,290
really helps people understand,

502
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,046
not just conceptually
and sort of from a book,

503
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:44,910
what a SQL injection or
cross-site scripting is

504
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,450
but it really translates
those types of laws

505
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,113
into actual web development.

506
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,810
Once they complete initial onboarding,

507
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,270
then we don't just train them
and never see them again.

508
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,974
We do monthly information sharing

509
00:19:56,974 --> 00:20:00,060
that could be meetings
where we come together

510
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,350
and we do deep dives on certain topics.

511
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,899
It could be really continual
chat ops that we have,

512
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,870
a private Slack room
for our security Ninjas

513
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,553
to ask questions of each other.

514
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:13,510
We've recently started
issuing a newsletter

515
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,030
that outlines things that
we want Ninjas to know,

516
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,610
but more importantly, identifying actions

517
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,074
and things that we want them to do.

518
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,730
One of the questions that
we always ask ourselves is,

519
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,250
is this just information
that's interesting,

520
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,670
or are there specific actions

521
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,320
that we want our Ninjas to take

522
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,889
or security teams to take,

523
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,376
sorry our product teams to take,

524
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,143
knowing that information.

525
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,790
So in addition to the
monthly information sharing,

526
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,010
we also offer quarterly hands-on events.

527
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,410
Our security Ninjas have
told us that they learn best

528
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,060
from hands-on learning.

529
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,730
And so we try every quarter

530
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,380
to offer some quarterly hands-on event,

531
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,990
where they can either come together

532
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,790
or individually work
through some challenges

533
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,129
or different things.

534
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,963
And lastly,

535
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:56,490
for those individuals who
just continually show us

536
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,440
that they can do more,
they want to do more,

537
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
they're very engaged,

538
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,860
when you joined the program,

539
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,919
we have a tiered system

540
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,830
and everyone who joins
comes in as a white belt,

541
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,470
but then as you are able to
make some meaningful change,

542
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,680
show some projects

543
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,110
and some ways that you've
gone above and beyond,

544
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,889
we have opportunities
for folks in the program

545
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,033
to become purple belt and even black belt.

546
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,540
So we know the people
who are in the program,

547
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,530
enjoy being in the program,

548
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,790
but the impact is really
where we are excited

549
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,780
about what this program has brought.

550
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,550
In terms of enjoying the program,

551
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,260
we survey our Ninjas every year

552
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,520
with questions about what
they like and don't like,

553
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,360
and it's in that with a net
promoter score question.

554
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,030
Net promoter score is
essentially a scale between

555
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,010
minus 100 and plus 100,

556
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,520
and everybody just chooses a number.

557
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,530
It takes out people who are neutral,

558
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,280
engages who really cares about this thing.

559
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,379
And the NPS, the net promoter score

560
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,000
for the security Ninja program
last year was a plus 49.

561
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,170
For some context,

562
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,900
a plus 49 is also the net
promoter score for iPhones.

563
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,674
So people like their iPhone,

564
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:06,690
about as much as they like being a Ninja,

565
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,150
which to me seems like a pretty high bar.

566
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,220
We also hear anecdotally from the Ninjas

567
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,033
that it's hard to leave the program.

568
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,930
When they're offered opportunities
in other teams in Target,

569
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,000
they're hesitant to take those jobs,

570
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,550
if it means they have
to give up their role

571
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,995
as security Ninja.

572
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:24,310
But we also hear from the teams

573
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,700
that these Ninjas participate
with and sit on and influence

574
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
that the teams and the
leaders of those teams,

575
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,820
also really think that they're
helping change the culture.

576
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,080
Some of the quotes that you can see

577
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,460
from last year survey,

578
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,237
our Ninjas tell us that their
team cares more about security

579
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:41,403
and they've done a better job
considering security early.

580
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,950
The product teams tell us
that our Ninjas influence team

581
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,980
culture toward a security aware mindset.

582
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,390
The leaders tell us that
the way that our team thinks

583
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,160
about security today is different.

584
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,387
And my personal favorite quote is,

585
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,340
"We have really skilled
folks in the program

586
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,840
who still have imposter syndrome."

587
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
And the quote is that

588
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,439
this program really helped me get over

589
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,990
my imposter syndrome and realized,

590
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,823
I'm good at this.

591
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:08,247
I can do this.

592
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:11,130
When we asked product teams collectively

593
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,750
to rate the effectiveness
of their security Ninja,

594
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,540
79% of the respondents said
that their security Ninja

595
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,389
was effective or very effective

596
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,300
at changing the security culture

597
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,023
and promoting that security
culture within their teams.

598
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:27,250
All right

599
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,994
The last myth that we'll be busting

600
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:31,713
is around testing all of the things.

601
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,050
The reason that this is an
interesting one to me is,

602
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,419
in the security world,

603
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,820
there are so many scary
things that can exist.

604
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,610
There are so many threats
against your system

605
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,050
and there are so many ways
that things can go wrong.

606
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,320
And it makes sense that
if I were a product team,

607
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,080
I would want to know
about all of those things

608
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,620
and all of the ways
that I could get better

609
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,439
to make sure that those
things that could go wrong,

610
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,640
don't go wrong.

611
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,366
And that was our hypothesis
going into a system

612
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,220
that we called spotlight SAST

613
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,810
and our goal was to start with SAST

614
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,280
and test all of the things,

615
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,080
give teams a lot of information,

616
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,031
really help them improve the
security of their systems

617
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,600
and be really transparent
about what we're finding

618
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,820
and what they needed to do.

619
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,996
So we created the system

620
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:13,190
and we made sure that it could scale

621
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,750
for the size of code
that we have in this pace

622
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,919
in which we're checking
in code and developing.

623
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,650
We were very excited.

624
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,100
We rolled it out and our
product teams hated it.

625
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,840
It was way too much information,

626
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,250
it was way too hard for them
to consume and prioritize.

627
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,820
So let's back up a little bit

628
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,620
and talk about what we were trying to do,

629
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,649
what we did and then why the myth

630
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,930
that testing all the things
maybe needed to be adjusted.

631
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,720
When we started the system,

632
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,142
our goal, as I said was to
improve the application security

633
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:44,300
of all of our software systems,

634
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,230
by integrating SAST, into
engineering practices.

635
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,610
We wanted to meet developers
where they worked,

636
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,340
we didn't want developers
to stop developing

637
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,290
and come over to the SAST system

638
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,072
to either check in code
or get their results.

639
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,830
We wanted to offer end to end solutions.

640
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,050
So not just finding issues,

641
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,220
but giving them meaningful
and helpful ways

642
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,520
to solve those issues once they were found

643
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,170
and our goal always is
to make the right way,

644
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,869
the secure way of doing something,

645
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,280
the easiest way for a
product team to do it.

646
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,920
And so, even though we've learned a lot

647
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,060
over the last three or
four years of this journey,

648
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,710
these are still the values
that we're bringing today.

649
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,580
So what is spotlight SAST?

650
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,179
This is just a screenshot that
you can see of the system.

651
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,450
And what it means is
that it's an interface

652
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,540
between our code management technologies

653
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,681
and the static scanning
or SAST technologies.

654
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:41,560
It's meant to integrate these
two things really easily,

655
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,100
so that within the code
management technology

656
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,149
teams can onboard to the SAST scans,

657
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,450
they can get their results

658
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:52,211
and they can see everything
that they need in one place.

659
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,760
What we learned in our first
iteration of the system

660
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,300
were many things.

661
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,050
What we launched in version one,

662
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,690
was all of the issues that were found,

663
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,730
we hypothesized,

664
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,610
like teams are gonna want
to know about all of these

665
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,919
and they're gonna want to
know about them individually

666
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,550
so that they can address
them individually.

667
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,290
And what we ended up doing
was just spamming teams

668
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,920
with issues sometimes dozen, if not more,

669
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,103
dozens of issues being found
within every scan that was run.

670
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,640
We also made some assumptions
about the kind of alerts

671
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,990
that they wanted to have.

672
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,213
For example, when we had bought the size,

673
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,950
or when the system ran,
but didn't find any issues

674
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,420
teams don't want to know about that,

675
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,980
we should only tell them
when there's a problem.

676
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,910
But we also didn't tell them,

677
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,330
when the scan ran but
failed for some reason.

678
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,246
So a lot of times teams would run a scan

679
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:45,360
and then not hear anything

680
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,260
and be left to figure it out on their own,

681
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,240
whether or not the scan was successful

682
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,734
or if that no issues were found.

683
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,960
So we did a really major overhaul

684
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,580
about 18 months after
we launched the system.

685
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,014
We consolidated the way that
we give information to teams

686
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:01,219
so that it was easier to consume.

687
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,810
And we really let them customize the way

688
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,840
that they could get all
of this information.

689
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,679
If they wanted an email,
they could choose that,

690
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,000
if they wanted their
information in GitHub issues

691
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,520
or in Jira stories, they could do that.

692
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
They could choose different
ways to be notified

693
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,840
when the system was performing

694
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,810
or when scans were getting
ready to be started.

695
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,907
And so the iteration of the system

696
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,139
and the really listening to customers,

697
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,200
has made the second
and subsequent versions

698
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,480
a lot more successful.

699
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
We still test all the things,

700
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,675
but we only share information with teams

701
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:34,270
that they have decided that,

702
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,629
we've decided are meaningful.

703
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,310
And it lets them take a little
bit more thoughtful look at

704
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,649
actually what needs to be done

705
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,563
and what maybe is a bit more noisy.

706
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,060
So in the last five years,

707
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,190
this is the product security journey

708
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,510
that this entire team has gone through,

709
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,480
has been very interesting.

710
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,610
We've learned so much,

711
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,136
we've tried to make meaningful
change wherever we could.

712
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,250
And when I think about the
things that we've learned

713
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,860
for these three systems that
I've talked about in programs

714
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,409
but really in some of the other programs

715
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,370
that we're running at Target as well,

716
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,969
the lessons learned
aren't all that different.

717
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,550
First iteration is key.

718
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,470
I talked about that a lot
with the spotlight SAST system

719
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,090
but you can start with an MVP

720
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,020
and be willing and able to pivot,

721
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,250
here your customers grow.

722
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,020
We would really be much less successful

723
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,853
than we have been today

724
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:28,180
if we hadn't gone back
and overhauled the system

725
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,590
in the way that we did based
on the customer feedback

726
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,933
that we had with the
spotlight SAST system.

727
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,800
The second really important lesson learned

728
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,919
and the thing that we
continue to ask ourselves

729
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,041
almost daily is what
behavior do we want to drive?

730
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,270
With every change to the PI score,

731
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,750
Product Intelligence score,

732
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,790
with every communication that we send

733
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,370
to our security Ninjas,

734
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,136
it's just really asking ourselves,

735
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:52,460
knowing is one thing

736
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,970
but what behavior do we want to drive

737
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,600
with this particular change?

738
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,530
And if we can't answer that question

739
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,040
and we really need to go back and say,

740
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,889
is this something that we really
wanna ask our teams to do?

741
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,642
The last one is a struggle for me

742
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:09,110
because the security world
is inherently complicated

743
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,649
but simplicity has been
the key to our success.

744
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,570
We have 4,500 developers,

745
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,629
we have hundreds of product teams,

746
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,360
anything that's overly complicated

747
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,370
has a really hard time being adopted.

748
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,070
So with the product score,

749
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,389
with the security Ninja program,

750
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,340
with the adjustments that
we've made to spotlight SAST,

751
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,240
taking a step back and simplifying

752
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,640
what we are giving to teams,

753
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,173
has really, really improved
our ability to be successful.

754
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,220
Thank you for listening for
the last 30 or so minutes.

755
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,270
Some of the things that we've done,

756
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,260
some of the myths that we've busted

757
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,780
in the product security
team here at Target,

758
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,129
following this talk,

759
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,610
I'll be joined by Caroline Wong

760
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,520
who is again, the Chief
Strategist and HR head at Cobalt.

761
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,610
And we'll be taking
some of your questions.

762
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,240
I think she has a few questions

763
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,790
and we'll go a little deeper on these

764
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,800
and lots of topics in the
application security space.

765
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,633
Thank you.
