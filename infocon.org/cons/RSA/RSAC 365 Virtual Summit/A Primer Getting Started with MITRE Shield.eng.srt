1
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:05,060
(uplifting music)

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,669
- Hello. I'm Bill Hill,

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,250
and with me is Christina Fowler.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,730
And we're here to introduce you

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,073
to a newly published
resource called MITRE Shield.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,960
For those of you that don't know MITRE,

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,610
our public private partnerships

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,160
and federally funded R&D centers

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,459
work to tackle challenges

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,810
to the safety, stability,
and wellbeing of our nation.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,450
As part of our public interest mission,

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,000
we work to bring communities together

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,503
to improve cyber security.

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,830
So although this talk is prerecorded,

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,030
we will be live in chat.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,490
So as we're going along,
feel free to put questions

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,360
in the chat window and
we'll try to answer them.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,750
So, anyway, with MITRE Shield,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,090
we're hoping to introduce
some ideas that are new

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,410
and hopefully game-changing.

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,422
So let's jump in.

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,000
Shield is a exposition of ideas

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,740
that we collectively
call "Active Defense,"

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,860
with a particular emphasis

25
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,083
on defensive adversary engagement.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,940
We've been using a variety of these ideas

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,820
for over 10 years now

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,820
in the defense of our corporate network.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,390
A bit about us, personally,

30
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,130
although I'm MITRE CISO,

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,949
I tend to be a pretty hands-on guy

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,790
and skeptical of traditional
passive security defenses.

33
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,530
I think Christine is pretty much the same,

34
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,973
except she's still hands-on.

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,933
So let me assure you

36
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,550
that what we're gonna show you today,

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,420
the information on Shield,

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,090
it's all based on experience,

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,563
practical lessons learned
and demonstrated value.

40
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,480
So what does active defense really mean?

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,560
We've looked around for definition

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,410
in cyber and other domains

43
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,390
and we haven't found
one that totally fits.

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,990
And we haven't come up
with one ourselves either.

45
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,320
It's tricky because it
means a lot of things.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,240
What it doesn't mean,

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,300
and please don't send
me hate mail about this,

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,720
but it means being not passive.

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,350
You know, it means taking an active role

50
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,699
in your own defense,

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,699
more than just plopping defenses out there

52
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,023
and forgetting about it.

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,910
So it includes a wide variety of things.

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,890
We've listed some of them,

55
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,390
but really the hallmark of it,

56
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,609
the foundation of it is,
I think, is an attitude.

57
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,200
It's understanding the idea
that you're in a fight,

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,589
you're in a fight with
an intelligent, adaptive,

59
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,310
determined adversary, who wants to win.

60
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,990
And the hallmark of active defense

61
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,460
means that you as a defender
are gonna be intelligent,

62
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,280
informed, adaptive,

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
and determined to counter that adversary.

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
And you're gonna try to learn more

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,070
than they do as you go forward.

66
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,489
So Shield is about showing
you some of the ways

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,140
you might think about doing that.

68
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,870
A little bit of background
about how we came to this.

69
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,750
We came to this through necessity.

70
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,990
A little over 10 years ago,

71
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,863
we had an active APT
intrusion to deal with.

72
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,290
And the realization at that time

73
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,609
was that we knew very little

74
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,870
about how that adversary operated.

75
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,240
So two important decisions were made.

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,210
First, that we were gonna
study, observe, learn enough

77
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,390
about the adversary to improve our chances

78
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,769
of kicking them out and keeping them out.

79
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,320
Second, was that once we did that,

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,250
we wanted to continue
that kind of learning,

81
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,220
but do it in a way that
didn't endanger our systems

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,083
or our data.

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,210
So our adversary engagement
program was born.

84
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,690
We did eject the APT,

85
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,490
and it's been helping us be
better defenders ever since.

86
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,350
You know, playing the old game

87
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,530
without that meant that the adversary

88
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,200
chooses the time, the place,

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,950
and the manner of the engagement,

90
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,489
and they're doing almost all the learning.

91
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,930
So what we wanted to do

92
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,480
was challenge the
adversary control of that

93
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,859
and start influencing the time, the place,

94
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,590
the manner of engagement,

95
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,700
and doing it in a way that
maximized our learning

96
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,063
and denied them learning.

97
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,649
So what do we mean by this sort of,

98
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,390
you know, adversary engagement idea?

99
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,653
Well, first of all, I wanna
be clear that it's defensive.

100
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,120
We're not talking about hack back.

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
So let me give you sort of an example

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,763
walking through what that looks like.

103
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,810
Well, let's say we have a piece
of malware we've identified,

104
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,940
maybe an attack that was emailed to us.

105
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,320
We can place that in a
special defender network.

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,820
We can run it and see what happens.

107
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,909
And typically what
happens is it phones home

108
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,200
to the attacker who
then uses our own system

109
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,120
to continue the exploitation
and then attack us,

110
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,090
either on that system or moving laterally,

111
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,030
or whatever until they've
achieved their objectives.

112
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,359
But in our case, this
network is synthetic.

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,310
We've created it for this purpose,

114
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,660
and the systems are instrumented

115
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,970
so that we can collect the
network traffic, the tools,

116
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,120
and observe what the adversary does.

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,340
That's what we mean

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,222
when we're talking defensive
adversary engagement.

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,580
So this idea of adversary engagement

120
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,969
has helped spur our thinking

121
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,710
and inspired us to create Shield,

122
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,070
but it's just part of a bigger thing

123
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,530
that we've called Active Defense.

124
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,020
Although mixing up with
the bad guys is fun,

125
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,060
to improve your defenses

126
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,020
you need to take what
you're learning there

127
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,049
and use it throughout all your defenses.

128
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,990
So that means, you know,
threat-based defense,

129
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,640
changing your engineering,
reconfiguring your defenses

130
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,890
to take advantage of what you're learning.

131
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,370
And it also means the more you share

132
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,250
that with your peers and
sharing organizations,

133
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,740
the better it becomes for everybody.

134
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,260
So that's the Shield origin story.

135
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,680
And Christina's gonna
go into a deeper dive

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,903
on Shield itself.

137
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,050
- So let's look at what Shield

138
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,020
is when we say active
defense knowledge base.

139
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,330
So when you go to the Shield website,

140
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,260
it's Shield.mitre.org,

141
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,730
what you'll see is a
compilation of information

142
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,730
that allows you, as a defender,
to counter your adversaries.

143
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,969
We're gonna talk to you about
opportunities that exist

144
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,130
for you as a defender,

145
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,963
things that you can do

146
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,180
that you may not have
thought about before.

147
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,830
We're gonna give you
techniques that you can use.

148
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,409
We're gonna talk about tactics

149
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,440
and goals and how you can achieve those.

150
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,480
And we're also gonna link the information

151
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,500
to MITRE ATT&CK.

152
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,000
So we feel like MITRE ATT&CK
gives a very good deal

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,420
of what adversaries do and
what capabilities they have.

154
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,210
So we're gonna link
the Shield information,

155
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,090
the defender side to that adversary side.

156
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,010
And the goal of all of this

157
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,719
is to stimulate thinking
about what's possible.

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
We're not gonna give
you all the solutions.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,710
Because every network is different,

160
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,430
because every organization
has different skills

161
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,940
and different tools,

162
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,600
we couldn't possibly give
you all the solutions,

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,900
but we want to get you
started down that path.

164
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
So the first thing I
want to do is call out

165
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,990
a couple of key pieces of
the MITRE Shield website.

166
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,520
And the first one I wanna
call out is the Matrix View.

167
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,159
So if you're familiar with MITRE ATT&CK,

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
this matrix is gonna look very similar.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,420
It's formatted in a very similar manner.

170
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,160
Across the top you're gonna
have a group of tactics.

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,170
There are eight of those in
this version of MITRE Shield.

172
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,540
And those are the things that
you're going to seek to do.

173
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,823
They're your goals, what
you wanna accomplish.

174
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,110
Then within the body of the matrix,

175
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,090
the individual cells are the techniques

176
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,739
that you're gonna use.

177
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,290
And each of those are repeated.

178
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,100
And we'll talk about a little bit more

179
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,480
of how this matrix works
a little bit later,

180
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,010
but I do wanna have you familiar with it

181
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,902
as we go through.

182
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,760
The other part of the Shield
website that I wanna call out

183
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,780
is the attack mapping section.

184
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,840
If you're a minor attack user,

185
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,239
this section is going to be useful to you.

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,550
The way this section is laid out

187
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,900
is we will give you a
MITRE ATT&CK technique.

188
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,383
That's what the adversary is going to do.

189
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,360
We're then going to give you an option

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,150
of an opportunity space,

191
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,349
something for you to consider,

192
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,520
something that you, the defender, can gain

193
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,123
when an adversary does a certain thing.

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
We're also gonna give you a use case.

195
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,270
A use case moves towards implementation,

196
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,650
again, not a specific implementation

197
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,719
but something that you might consider

198
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,153
when you're planning your active defense.

199
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,630
And the technique is the actual tool

200
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,462
that you're gonna use,

201
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,169
or the technique that you're gonna use,

202
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,669
how you're gonna get
through that implementation

203
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,823
and accomplish that opportunity.

204
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,159
So how does that look like?

205
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
So at a top level, let
me just kind of summarize

206
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,339
that vocabulary there for you.

207
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,453
So an opportunity space
is what you can gain.

208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,067
A tactic is, "What's your goal?"

209
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,967
A use case, "What's your plan?"

210
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,707
And a technique is, "How do I do it?"

211
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,963
So let's dive deeper.

212
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,600
Opportunity space.

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,000
What can you, as a defender,
gain from implementing

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,323
an active defense?

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,319
So Bill talked about that adversaries,

216
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,470
typically, are in control.

217
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,830
So with opportunity space,

218
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,010
we're trying to flip the perspective,

219
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,100
what can you as a defender get,

220
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,080
how can you as a defender
change the battlefield,

221
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,540
change the time,

222
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,120
and ultimately change the outcome,

223
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,170
'cause that's your goal,

224
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,579
is you want to be in control of the game,

225
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,040
of the fight of the battlefield

226
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,633
Tactics.

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,190
Those are those things you
wanna accomplish, those goals.

228
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,390
So when you're looking at
these, there's eight of them,

229
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,810
think about what your organization

230
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,579
wants to get out of active defense.

231
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,030
Do you wanna move an
adversary a certain way

232
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,680
and channel them?

233
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,459
Do you wanna collect all their stuff,

234
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,200
collect their malware, collect their TTPs,

235
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,500
collect their behaviors,
collect their indicators?

236
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,350
Do you wanna contain them?

237
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,900
Do you wanna keep them in a box,

238
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,920
or keep them in a certain
area of your network?

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,930
Do you wanna detect them,

240
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,199
even know that they're there,

241
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,113
disrupt them and make them go away?

242
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,130
We also introduced some
things like facilitate,

243
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,323
help them along.

244
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,990
Legitimize, make all your deceptions,

245
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,983
all your decoys look real,

246
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,603
and test, validate the things
that you think you know.

247
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,439
Use cases. We've talked about.

248
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,273
Leads towards implementation.

249
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:46,480
And again, implementation
is all gonna be specific

250
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,500
to your organization,

251
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,180
specific to your tooling,

252
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,930
specific to what you have in play,

253
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,483
your skills and your resources.

254
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,050
So our use cases in Shield are just ways

255
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,750
to make you think about these,

256
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,990
illustrations of the possible.

257
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,070
So something like seeding a
decoy system with credentials,

258
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,700
however you choose to do that.

259
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,380
It may be a real system or a decoy.

260
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,780
However you choose, it's up to you.

261
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,300
We're just gonna give you some options

262
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
that you might consider.

263
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,800
And then techniques.

264
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,510
Techniques are the actions
you're going to take.

265
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,563
What you're gonna do.

266
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,589
And the techniques in Shield are versatile

267
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,420
and they are designed to
give you multiple options

268
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,459
in many cases.

269
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,900
So one technique applied one
way can allow an adversary

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,189
to do something.

271
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,520
That same technique
applied a different way

272
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,030
can block an action,

273
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,173
or keep them from doing something.

274
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,030
In this version of MITRE Shield,

275
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,270
there are 33 techniques,

276
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,890
and we believe 33 techniques
are extremely powerful

277
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,550
to you as a defender.

278
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,660
So we invite you to look at each of those,

279
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,240
see which ones you're
already comfortable doing.

280
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,730
You may do them today,
like create an account.

281
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,470
So creating a decoy account

282
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,430
that you used for active defense purposes

283
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,010
may not be a stretch at all.

284
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,819
It may be a very low barrier to entry,

285
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,050
and an easy thing to start with.

286
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,550
So look at the techniques

287
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,380
and see how they may work
for your organization.

288
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,073
So let's talk about the
Shield Matrix one more time.

289
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,580
So in this matrix, when
you're starting to look at

290
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,970
how you can apply Shield,

291
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,230
one of the things that
makes it a little easier

292
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,840
is when you kind of carve up the matrix

293
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,100
and look at how you might apply it.

294
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,010
So you might wanna start
in the first five columns.

295
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,750
We really believe these first
five columns are applicable

296
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,490
to everybody.

297
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,540
So maybe you're gonna
channel your adversary,

298
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,420
move them away, collect all their stuff,

299
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,803
all those fun things.

300
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,680
You're gonna wanna look down,

301
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,189
again, these are your goals.

302
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,200
You're gonna look down the
columns of these goals,

303
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,930
and say, which techniques am I doing now?

304
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,930
Maybe I'm already creating decoy accounts

305
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,189
and decoys credentials.

306
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,850
Maybe I can create a
decoy content very easy.

307
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,873
So this is a good starting place.

308
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,640
As you move into your
familiarity with Shield,

309
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,420
you get more comfortable with it,

310
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,240
then you might move towards
the last three columns,

311
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,313
which are geared towards
adversary engagement,

312
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,200
things where you're
gonna put your adversary

313
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,520
in a decoy network,

314
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,360
and you want them to stay
there as long as possible.

315
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,910
You want them to expend as
many resources as possible,

316
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,959
show you their TTPs,
give you their malware,

317
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,700
and really let you observe them firsthand.

318
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,120
So you're gonna wanna
facilitate, help them along.

319
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
You're gonna want that
environment to look so realistic

320
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,119
that they don't know
they're in a decoy network.

321
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,950
So it's gonna be a legitimize goal.

322
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,780
And then the last but not least is tests,

323
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,740
where we are gonna validate
what you think you know

324
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,573
about an adversary.

325
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,890
Maybe you think they have
a certain capability,

326
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,240
or you don't think they're after

327
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,510
a certain type of information.

328
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,503
All those things can be validated
through the test tactic.

329
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,339
While there are some pieces

330
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,810
that you'll apply in other
areas, like legitimize,

331
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,199
you'll want your decoys look legitimate,

332
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,500
your overarching goal is
going to be channel, collect,

333
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,510
contain, detect,

334
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,380
unless you're in adversary engagement,

335
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,510
where the overall goal
is to make this thing

336
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,453
look as legitimate as possible.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,110
So again, let me reiterate.

338
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,890
The first five columns are
where we want people to start

339
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,640
and get comfortable.

340
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,810
As you're getting started
with MITRE Shield,

341
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,500
you're gonna look down these columns

342
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,763
and you're gonna see techniques repeated.

343
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,700
We do that because we
believe those techniques

344
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
have a lot of power.

345
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,729
So a single technique applied one way

346
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,480
can allow an adversary to do something.

347
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,063
It can also deny an adversary
from doing something.

348
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,350
So in that power, as a defender,

349
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,523
you choose what you want to do.

350
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,150
So don't be afraid that these
techniques are repeated.

351
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,382
It's by design.

352
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,380
So let's talk about some use cases.

353
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,320
So I've kind of seen the techniques.

354
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,170
I've seen the tactics, the
opportunities, the use cases.

355
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,829
How do I kind of make this
all work in my environment?

356
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,170
So let's go through a
very simple use case.

357
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,000
I wanna use MITRE Shield
to detect the presence

358
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,943
of an adversary.

359
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,920
So, you know your goal.

360
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,829
Your goal is to detect.

361
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,150
So you go and look across the matrix

362
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,343
and you see detect.

363
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,350
You then go down that
column and say, okay,

364
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,783
of all the techniques
in the detect tactic,

365
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,189
what do I wanna use?

366
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,017
And I just mentioned that decoy counts

367
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:57,140
and decoy credentials, passwords,

368
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,380
those are things you do every day.

369
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,900
Many companies create accounts constantly,

370
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,742
put passwords to those accounts.

371
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,103
So I choose to use decoy credentials.

372
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,319
I can create the decoy credentials.

373
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,550
I can sprinkle those credentials

374
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,579
among the systems, either
in secure enclaves,

375
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,680
sensitive systems or
anywhere else in my network,

376
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
however I might choose to do it.

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,877
And then I can set up monitoring and say,

378
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,870
"If those credentials are used,

379
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,370
and they shouldn't be,

380
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,840
but if they're used, it signals badness,"

381
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,380
activity that I care about,

382
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,043
that I wanna investigate further.

383
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,143
That is, in its easiest
form, a use case for Shield.

384
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,120
Let's talk about one a
little more, a little deeper,

385
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,170
and also one a little
fresher in our minds.

386
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,000
So many people may have seen this chart.

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,860
And if you haven't seen this chart,

388
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,060
this comes from a Microsoft blog

389
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,969
about the SolarWinds intrusion

390
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,920
that happened and came out in December.

391
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,213
Many companies were victim of this attack.

392
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,310
And from reading the blog

393
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,990
and reading the information
on the SolarWinds attack,

394
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,950
what we can see is that the
adversary brings down malware,

395
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,563
malware is brought down,

396
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,113
that malware inspects the
environment that it comes into.

397
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,880
If you were using deception
and you were using Shield,

398
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,100
and you knew the
adversary TTPs in advance,

399
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
you could have planted
some decoy processes

400
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,842
that look like security software,

401
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,943
that when the adversary's
malware inspected it,

402
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,770
the malware would have shut down.

403
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes, you would've had to plan ahead.

404
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,750
You would have had to
know this adversary TTPs.

405
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,670
You would have had to study them before

406
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,840
or read articles about them to know this.

407
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,882
So let's say you miss that opportunity.

408
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,810
Once the malware continues on,

409
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,143
it gathers information about the system.

410
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,950
If you knew that, you could
have planted some decoy content

411
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,740
within your network

412
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,370
that the adversaries
malware would have grabbed,

413
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,790
pulled in with all the other information,

414
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,580
and now the adversary has a mix
of decoy data and real data,

415
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,020
and they have to be able
to discern which is which,

416
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,379
and maybe they can't do that,

417
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,100
and maybe it throws off

418
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,129
or influences the rest of
their work and activity

419
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,760
in your network.

420
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,090
That's the beauty of deception.

421
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,699
The adversary doesn't know
the legitimate information

422
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,950
and the fake information,

423
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,780
but let's say you miss that.

424
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,062
When the malware continues on,

425
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,220
and the adversary goes hands on keyboard,

426
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,010
one of the first things that
the adversary is going to do

427
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,190
is they're going to look
to escalate privileges

428
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,590
or compromise credentials.

429
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,110
So you could have created
those decoy credentials

430
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,600
and seeded it throughout your network

431
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,899
as we talked about before,

432
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,580
and anytime you see those
credentials being used

433
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,062
you would know that an
adversary was present.

434
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,949
The last thing that you could've done

435
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,300
is you could've created a
decoy system or a decoy network

436
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,040
and you could push this adversary into it,

437
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,290
and you could then let them stay

438
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,550
and expand resources,

439
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,290
and show you TTPs,

440
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,399
and you could just watch them,

441
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,450
and gather all that intelligence

442
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,033
and reapply it to your defenses later on.

443
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,220
So I just wanna use this

444
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,680
to show you that as you
research an adversary,

445
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
and you learn their TTPs,

446
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,440
you can always go back
and apply those things

447
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,010
to your network and improve your defenses,

448
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,227
'cause maybe you didn't
catch them this time,

449
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,877
but you'll be ready for them
the next time they come.

450
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,190
So one last use case.

451
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,980
Let's go back to the slide
that Bill showed you,

452
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,183
where we talked about
adversary engagement.

453
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,280
How does this actually work?

454
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,700
How do you make this happen?

455
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,010
So all the elements in Shield

456
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,580
come from adversary engagement.

457
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,290
Bill told you that.

458
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,250
So if you're going to do this,

459
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,700
what you're gonna do

460
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,630
is you're gonna build
the full decoy network.

461
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,820
You're gonna have a collection
of decoys systems within it,

462
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,950
with decoy accounts, decoy credentials,

463
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,113
all that fun stuff.

464
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,470
You're gonna instrument that
network with monitoring,

465
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,720
with packet capture,

466
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,660
system monitoring, network monitoring

467
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,980
you name it.

468
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,250
And you're going to make
sure that everything

469
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,970
that you have in that
network meets your needs

470
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,423
and goes towards the goal
that you have in mind.

471
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,970
You're the end of the take
malware that you obtained.

472
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,083
You're gonna detonate it on
that system and in that network.

473
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,993
And then you're gonna have a little fun.

474
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,630
So as the adversary engages,

475
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,090
you're in control of that battlefield,

476
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,320
you're in control of the time,

477
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,379
you're in control of the outcome,

478
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,330
So you're gonna adjust
your security controls

479
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,389
to get to the outcome that you want.

480
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,370
So maybe you let them go a little deeper

481
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,540
into that deception network.

482
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,700
Maybe you close them off

483
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,940
and see if they can expose
some other capabilities.

484
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,760
But your whole goal
here is to learn as much

485
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,150
about your adversary as possible,

486
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,180
and then feed all that information back

487
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,780
into your overall network defenses.

488
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,310
At the end of the day,

489
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,629
you have a much better security posture,

490
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,320
because the information
that you're feeding in

491
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,320
for your defenses is firsthand
observed information.

492
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,000
- Thanks, Christina.

493
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,323
So that's a little bit
about Shield in some detail.

494
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,506
And one of the common
things, is we're asked,

495
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,060
"How do you get started?"

496
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,720
And I know it's not satisfying,

497
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,920
but there's no really
single answer to that.

498
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,959
A lot of this is a your-mileage-may-vary,

499
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,173
sort of depending on where
your team is right now.

500
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,970
We do think that, though, that...

501
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,260
We believe that these
approaches are accessible

502
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,890
to every team, big and small,

503
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,710
well-funded or on a shoe string,

504
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,810
we think there's
something in here for you,

505
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,300
and that you can develop it over time.

506
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,500
So that's the good news.

507
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,350
The other good news is I think
the first step is pretty easy

508
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,959
because it goes back to that attitude.

509
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,250
The first step in doing
this is in developing

510
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,220
sort of that scrappy
street fighter attitude,

511
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,200
that says, "I know I'm in
a fight and I wanna win it.

512
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,270
I wanna be that adaptive,
intelligent adversary

513
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,820
for the guy on the other side."

514
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
So once you leave that,

515
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,653
those first two steps,

516
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,470
you definitely hit
your-mileage-may-vary territory.

517
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,320
If your team is not
familiar with a lot of this,

518
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,092
then the starting place is
things like threat sharing,

519
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,639
you know, threat-based defense,

520
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,030
tuning your defenses based
on what you can learn about

521
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,680
the obvious areas that are attacking you,

522
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,440
and really developing your
community connections.

523
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,800
If your team is already comfortable

524
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,960
with those sort of
things, you could move on.

525
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,660
And that's where things
like adversary engagement

526
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,290
can come in.

527
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,840
And there, again,

528
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,230
that does not have to be a
super sophisticated thing.

529
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,660
You can get started on a shoestring.

530
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,563
That's how we did.

531
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,340
Our first quote-unquote
"environment" was pretty simple.

532
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,139
And yet, it did get the job done.

533
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,690
So we think there's ways to go.

534
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,280
I think the other thing
that we're often asked

535
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,139
is for the gotchas,

536
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,000
you know, what should I be
wary of as I enter this space?

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,300
I think both Christina and I

538
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,580
have some lessons learned there.

539
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,080
Christina, do you wanna start?

540
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,717
- Sure, absolutely.

541
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,140
So I think the most important thing

542
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,470
is start cultivating
that management support,

543
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,900
making sure your manager's on board

544
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,470
with what you're trying to do.

545
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,410
And even if your manager's on board,

546
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,320
what about your legal department?

547
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,330
How are they gonna feel about this?

548
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,360
Deception is one thing,

549
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,580
adversary engagement is
something totally different.

550
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,629
So make sure you're building
that support as you go,

551
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,650
'cause the last thing you want to do

552
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,680
is be ready to implement

553
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,830
and realize you have
no support behind you.

554
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,230
The other thing is really look at

555
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,630
what you can do for your team.

556
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,910
Can you use adversary engagement

557
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,980
to add to your incident
response capabilities

558
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,910
and your skills,

559
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,950
grow your team using
this hands-on experience?

560
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,700
Can you let your team
just have a little fun

561
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,650
going toe-to-toe?

562
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,960
Everybody likes a good fight, right?

563
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,530
Can you just have fun with your team

564
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,550
and let them not just implement
firewalls and antivirus,

565
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,183
but go toe-to-toe day in, day out?

566
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,970
- Right, so depending on
who you're talking to,

567
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,477
you can talk to your CISO about
retention factors (laughs).

568
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,970
Maybe not so much as it being about fun,

569
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,563
but this is definitely skill-building,

570
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:13,220
it allows you practice,

571
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,150
it helps you get better
at what you're doing,

572
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,660
and yes, the team does like it.

573
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,250
You know, some of our most creative people

574
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,830
have been with us for a long time.

575
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,530
And I think in no small part

576
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,670
because they feel like they're
doing something different,

577
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,143
and something that actually is working.

578
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,949
So that said, I think,

579
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,550
you know, we'll wrap it up here.

580
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,970
I think we want to
continue the conversation

581
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,540
with anybody that's interested.

582
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,330
So, you know, this is an initial effort.

583
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,620
It's definitely not finished.

584
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,699
So we know that.

585
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,150
But if you are interested in these things,

586
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,170
we'd love to hear from you,

587
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,420
and we'd be interested
in building a community

588
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,960
around these ideas.

589
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,500
So let us know.

590
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,473
And with that, well,
thank you for listening.
