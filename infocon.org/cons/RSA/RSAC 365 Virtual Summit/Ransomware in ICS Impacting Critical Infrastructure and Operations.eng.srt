1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
- Thank you so much.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,030
Thank you so much RSA for having us

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,730
at the 365 virtual summit.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,040
My name is Selena Larson.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,790
I am the senior cyber
threat analyst at Dragos

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,299
which is industrial control
systems cyber security company,

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,893
and here with my friend
and colleague, Camille.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,793
- Hi, I'm great.

9
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:17,890
I'm Camille Singleton.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,950
I am the strategic cyber threat lead

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,993
at IBM Security X-Force.

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,063
- Sweet.

13
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,240
And today the two of us
are going to be discussing

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,709
some research that we have
recently conducted and published

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,163
on ransomware in industrial
control system environments.

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,220
To give you a little bit of an outline

17
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,530
of what we're gonna be
talking about today,

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,530
we have compiled a bunch of research data

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,100
and ransomware history to kind of discuss

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,940
the impacts operations as
well as this new evolution

21
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,390
of ICS-specific ransomware.

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,260
As we all know, ransomware
is a massive problem.

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,940
And it does have a unique impact
to industrial organizations

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,250
and their industrial operations.

25
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,080
Some of the new trends that
we've seen are this idea

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,920
of human-operated ransomware

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,810
and the idea of double extortion.

28
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,270
So data theft, in addition
to the encryption function

29
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,720
of ransomware.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,600
Camille's gonna talk about
some future predictions,

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,759
what are we seeing on the
horizon for ransomware?

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,977
And then finally,

33
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:15,720
we're gonna go over some
defensive recommendations.

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,830
So what can you as a defender
do in your organization

35
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,523
to reduce risk and keep
yourself more secure.

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,260
As a bit of an overview,
ransomware is a very, very serious

37
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,340
and ongoing threat to all businesses.

38
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,170
Although we're gonna
be talking specifically

39
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,420
about operations, industrial
control system environments,

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,050
it is not unique to ICS.

41
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,899
Certainly we've seen a lot of
issues impacting healthcare,

42
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,930
state and local governments,
small businesses.

43
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,400
It's really widespread threat,

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,240
and it does have some very direct

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,880
as well as indirect impacts

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,009
to operational technology environments.

47
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,110
When we say OT, that
means that the technology,

48
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,670
the computers devices that
are sort of controlling

49
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,010
the functions of the
industrial environment, right?

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,430
So as human machine
interface, for instance,

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,860
you can program it to operate an arm

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,293
in manufacturing facility,
things like that.

53
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,250
Ransomware is adopting ICS-specific code

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,090
to stop industrial processes.

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,310
This is very concerning and
does show kind of an evolution

56
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,420
of ransomware that we're
gonna talk about today.

57
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,010
And then finally attackers are
becoming increasingly hostile

58
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,243
in a number of ways that we will discuss.

59
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,820
All of this data is based on
220 incidents of ransomware

60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,660
against ICS and supporting entities.

61
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,920
This has compiled from 2018 through 2020.

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,640
Camille and I have both gone
through the internal datasets

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,170
that we have at Dragos and at IBM X-Force

64
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,089
as well as publicly available data.

65
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,430
I do wanna point out here
that it's very difficult

66
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,990
to discern a full picture
of the threat environment

67
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,573
due to visibility issues.

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,840
Oftentimes companies won't report

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,490
if they've been a victim
of a ransomware attack

70
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,870
and it can be very difficult
to get a true numbers,

71
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,870
but this is the scope and depth,
which I say is pretty cool

72
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,233
and interesting of our research.

73
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,020
It has existed for decades, right?

74
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,950
Ransomware is not necessarily
a new threat at all.

75
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,609
But what we saw with
the WannaCry ransomware

76
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,460
and NotPetya malware worms

77
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,820
was that the world became
aware of a very serious threat,

78
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,870
disruptive IT malware
can have to businesses

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,500
and industrial operations.

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,020
Not just from a financial perspective,

81
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,810
but an operations perspective as well.

82
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,970
And historically cyber
crime ransomware operators

83
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,220
targeted victims, sort
of indiscriminately.

84
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,680
And in 2018, we sort
of began to see a shift

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
into big game hunting, right?

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,720
So these adversaries that are
going after large businesses,

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,540
large enterprises that
can effectively guarantee

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,500
a sort of higher payout.

89
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,830
And with that, I'm gonna
kick it over to Camille

90
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,590
to talk about some attacks we've seen.

91
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,470
- Great, thanks so much for
that introduction, Selena.

92
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,720
And now I'm going to spend
just a couple of minutes

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,430
discussing what we found
in our updated dataset

94
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,060
through our analysis.

95
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,510
So from this chart here,

96
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,530
I think it becomes obvious
that ransomware attacks

97
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,170
against ICS-connected
organizations have increased

98
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,000
over the past two years.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,070
And in fact, we've found
that they have increased 500%

100
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,399
from 2018 through 2020.

101
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,469
So, whereas in 2018, it was
common to see only one or two

102
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,760
such ransomware attacks a month

103
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,080
in the press or among our clients,

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,990
the average in 2020 is about 12 per month.

105
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,260
So this is pretty significant growth.

106
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,300
And suggests that ransomware
attackers are increasingly

107
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,580
finding ICS targets to be
attractive and profitable

108
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,210
for their business.

109
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,349
We do acknowledge that as
attackers are publicly announcing

110
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,870
ransomware attacks and leaking data,

111
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,180
this is probably increasing the
number of ransomware attacks

112
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,160
that we become aware of as researchers.

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,230
But we're seeing increases
in ransomware attacks

114
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,610
against even our internal only data

115
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,770
which gives us confidence

116
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,370
that there really has been an
overall increase in attacks

117
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,560
against ICS over the past two years.

118
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,610
So on the next slide, it bears mentioning

119
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,390
that this increase coincided
with the coronavirus pandemic

120
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,120
that began in late 2019

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,780
and accelerated in the spring of 2020.

122
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,789
We wouldn't say that this
correlation indicates causation,

123
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,830
but it does mean that we have observed

124
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,780
the coronavirus pandemic and
increasing ransomware attacks

125
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,640
against ICS interact in unique ways.

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,810
So for example, we observed
several threat actors capitalize

127
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,330
on COVID-19 themed phishing learners

128
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,979
for initial access to networks.

129
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,810
A tactic that was particularly
popular in March and April

130
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,810
of 2020 as audiences worldwide
developed a strong appetite

131
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,770
for COVID-19 related information.

132
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,200
More recently, as vaccines
were nearing completion

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,960
and preparing for distribution operations,

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,150
we observed ransomware adversaries

135
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,960
target cold storage facilities

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,969
and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

137
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,420
In fact, our dataset
revealed that the number

138
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,980
of ransomware attacks against
pharmaceutical companies

139
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,070
in just the last two months of 2020

140
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,760
was the same as all ransomware attacks

141
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,760
against pharmaceuticals from
early 2018 up to that point.

142
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,420
And IBM Security X-Force has
observed additional actors,

143
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,680
even beyond ransomware actors

144
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,850
targeting the COVID-19 cold chain as well.

145
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,800
And all of these cyber activities

146
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,746
have the potential to
disrupt the distribution

147
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,630
of these vital vaccines.

148
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,120
Well, health care facilities
and hospitals are not in scope

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,170
for the definition of ICS.

150
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,010
We do recognize the significant
harm from ransomware attacks

151
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,219
that these facilities have
endured over the past year.

152
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,760
So on the next slide, in addition
to a general upward trend

153
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,930
in ransomware attacks against
ICS-connected organizations,

154
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,550
our dataset revealed that North
America is the most targeted

155
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,150
out of all geographies,

156
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,150
and experienced 45% of the
ransomware attacks on ICS

157
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,599
from 2018 to 2020.

158
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,270
Europe came in second at 32% of attacks

159
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,340
with Asia third at 16%.

160
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,909
Now we do recognize that the
researchers for this study,

161
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,650
ourselves, speak English
as their primary language

162
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,030
with some European language capabilities.

163
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,150
So this may have affected these outcomes.

164
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,380
But this geographic dispersion
also makes a lot of sense.

165
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,940
As many ransomware
attack overs have shifted

166
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,690
to big game hunting, going
after large corporations

167
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,219
with high yearly revenue

168
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,350
where a high ransom demand might be met.

169
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,630
And many of these corporations
are in North America,

170
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,630
Europe and Asia, where 89%
of the world's GDP resides.

171
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,340
So in addition to geographies,

172
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,060
on the next slide we looked
at industries targeted,

173
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,670
and far and away manufacturing emerged

174
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,380
as the most targeted
industry from 2018 to 2020,

175
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,630
ending up on the receiving
end more than 1/3

176
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,460
of all ransomware attacks on
ICS during that time period.

177
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,449
For many manufacturing companies,

178
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,659
just one hour of downtime
can translate into millions

179
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,260
of dollars in losses,
which ransomware attackers

180
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,640
appear to have found creates a situation

181
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,790
where many manufacturing companies

182
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,980
find themselves under intense
pressure to pay the ransom

183
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,060
in an attempt to quickly
resolve the issue.

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,060
After manufacturing, utility
companies came in second at 9%

185
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,240
of attacks.

186
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,240
And in 2018, utility companies
made up only 5% of attacks

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
on ICS industries.

188
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,550
So you can see how this
percentage has grown over time.

189
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,579
Again, ransomware attackers

190
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,760
probably consider utility companies

191
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,300
especially profitable targets,

192
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
and therefore are going
after them more frequently.

193
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,170
And from here, I'm gonna
hand it back over to Selena

194
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,110
to discuss how these ransomware
attacks affect operations

195
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,273
at ICS organizations.

196
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,773
- Great.

197
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:35,710
Thank you so much, Camille.

198
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,880
Also shout out to the work that
you and your team have done

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,400
on the cold chain research.

200
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,959
I know that there's a lot
of attention paid right now

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,430
to developing and distributing
the coronavirus vaccine.

202
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,050
So really great work there.

203
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,339
And all of the researchers

204
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,530
and all the cybersecurity companies

205
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,569
that are looking into that
as well, very important work.

206
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,810
So when we're talking
about impacts to operations

207
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,089
of the attacks, in which
the scope of impact is known

208
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,000
that is we know what the impacts

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,010
were to both the IT enterprise function

210
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,200
as well as the OT function.

211
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,610
50% of ransomware attacks
affected operations functionality

212
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,090
at victim organizations.

213
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,280
In some cases, weeks long downtime.

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,920
This includes shipping
and logistics disruption.

215
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,240
So products were unable to be delivered,

216
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,590
manufacturing operations,
entire plants went down

217
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,800
due to ransomware
attacks, employee layoffs

218
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,370
which is really interesting to me

219
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,610
because we often forget
about the human impact

220
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,750
that ransomware has.

221
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,730
It's not just business
functions that are disrupted,

222
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,930
people lose their jobs.

223
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,159
People are unable to get paid.

224
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,960
People have to go home

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,100
and potentially find other ways
of supporting their families

226
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,460
or have to kind of wait until
operations are back up again

227
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,280
in order to get back to work.

228
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,130
Order processing,

229
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,500
another one that is
very intricately linked

230
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,040
to the entire operations process

231
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,219
as well as disruption to control
and communications assets.

232
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,700
That is the assets that are
responsible for monitoring,

233
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,830
communicating and controlling
industrial processes

234
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,523
within an environment.

235
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,520
So talking about ICS-specific ransomware,

236
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,800
this is something that we
find very, very interesting

237
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,568
certainly here at Dragos, but
a lot of ransomware types,

238
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,380
well, I shouldn't say a
lot, some ransomware types

239
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,810
such as EKANS for instance
have begun to adopt

240
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,689
the ability to disrupt
industrial equipment.

241
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,273
Historically, what we've
seen with ransomware is,

242
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:30,740
it's sort of IT-focused,
windows-focused ransomware malware

243
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,140
that has encryption functionality

244
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,410
highly targeted towards
the sort of IT functions.

245
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,410
But what we're seeing is
ransomware that begins to have,

246
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,680
within its code, mechanisms
that can force stop processes

247
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,560
on certain human machine
interfaces for instance,

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,020
data historians, licensing servers.

249
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,380
The list of targeted devices
grows as new strains are found.

250
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,700
EKANS certainly isn't the only one,

251
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,030
but that's certainly one
that Dragos has been spending

252
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,110
a lot of research and paying attention to.

253
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,383
But we have other strains
such as like MegaCortex

254
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:04,170
and Cobalt that had also begun

255
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,079
to sort of have these
ICS-specific capabilities

256
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,963
to forcibly disrupt equipment within ICS.

257
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,470
So one of the things that
we wanted to talk about

258
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,050
was a case study to kind of
see the ransomware OT impacts.

259
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,109
This is just one of many,
many that were experienced

260
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,690
throughout 2020, but on March 4th, 2020

261
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,240
a Ryuk infection at the manufacturer Evraz

262
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,840
impacted North American operations
including email shipping,

263
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,100
product certification,
internet availability,

264
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,630
and corporate networks.

265
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,950
So the attack ultimately
resulted in shutdowns

266
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,780
of the steel and pipe divisions

267
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,069
across the North American production

268
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,010
as well as temporary layoffs
for over 1,000 workers

269
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,950
for at least four days.

270
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,160
One of the things that I wanted
to kind of point out here

271
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,930
is that we got a lot of
information we as researchers,

272
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,979
got a lot of information
from the United steel workers

273
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,670
of America, their actual union website.

274
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,000
It was really interesting
to see that communicate

275
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:06,650
the sort of human
impacts, the labor impacts

276
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,160
of the steel and pipe division shutdowns

277
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,020
as well as the layoffs that were incurred

278
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,360
and kind of just being really
open and discussing the human

279
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,610
and employee impact that
this ransomware had.

280
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,410
There was also some really
great open source coverage

281
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,242
of this as well

282
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:24,100
which is something that
you don't necessarily see

283
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,013
all too often with these ransomware cases.

284
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,219
And with that, I will
hand it back to Camille

285
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,500
to discuss this idea of
human-operated ransomware.

286
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,440
- Great, thank you so much, Selena.

287
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,020
So, an additional trend we
wanted to discuss is the rise

288
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,653
of human-operated ransomware.

289
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,640
In 2017, we saw several
wormable ransomware strains

290
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,350
such as WannaCry and NotPetya.

291
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,650
And these ransomware types
are self-propagating,

292
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,550
and can spread automatically
through compromised networks.

293
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,250
It also appears that
these ransomware strains

294
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,780
may have accidentally infected
hundreds of organizations

295
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,860
in an effect that may not
have been intentional.

296
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,950
So the good news is that
today the vast majority

297
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,520
of the ransomware we
see is human-operated,

298
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,890
where humans are behind the keyboard

299
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,350
intentionally choosing their targets,

300
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,030
gaining access, escalating
privileges, moving laterally

301
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,089
and deploying ransomware.

302
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,010
The bad news is that these
human-operated attackers

303
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,360
are pretty good at what they do.

304
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,240
And their intentional targeting
often leads to what for them

305
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,970
are successful operations on a wide scale.

306
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,370
So on the next slide,

307
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,970
we have a chart that provides a breakdown

308
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,050
of the ransomware types we have observed

309
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,120
against ICS-connected networks since 2018.

310
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,870
And as you can see, wormable ransomware

311
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,870
such as ransom WannaCry is
still on the list at 6%.

312
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,950
And this is a strain we still see today

313
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,660
especially in sensitive OT environments

314
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,449
with legacy infrastructure
that is difficult to update

315
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,600
to avoid that eternal blue exploit.

316
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,700
However, the vast majority
of ransomware strains

317
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,610
we see are human-operated
to include Sodinokibi, Ryuk,

318
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,070
Maze, Doppelpaymer, Netwalker and others.

319
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,250
And some of these such as
EKANS are specially designed

320
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,170
to impact ICS environments.

321
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,339
And now I'm going to hand it
back over to Selena to discuss

322
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,770
how these human-operated
ransomware strains

323
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,683
tend to gain initial access
and spread through a network.

324
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,270
- Great, thanks Camille.

325
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,050
So most of the initial access
factors are phishing, right?

326
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,479
Email spear phishing
remains a very, very active

327
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,460
and effective method of initial access.

328
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,540
We're also seeing remote
services compromise

329
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,360
such as remote desktop protocol,

330
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
as well as exploitation of
software vulnerabilities

331
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,850
like virtual private
network, VPN concentrators,

332
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,830
and enterprise network equipment.

333
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,730
It seems to me, I feel
like throughout 2020

334
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,700
especially maybe summer fall timeframe

335
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,950
there was like one new
critical vulnerability a week,

336
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,630
any sort of enterprise network equipment

337
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,920
that was very very quickly exploited,

338
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,599
whether it was Citrix vulnerabilities,

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,810
Juniper networks, Palo Alto,

340
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,099
it did seem that ransomware
adversaries as well as a number

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,620
of other cyber adversaries
were very quick to jump

342
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,450
on the exploitation of vulnerabilities

343
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,660
once proofs of concept were made known.

344
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Tool use often includes Mimikatz,
credential reuse, PSExec,

345
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,079
abuse of windows, service
accounts, and management tools.

346
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,110
We are seeing a lot of this
sort of living off the land

347
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,380
especially when you're talking about

348
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,280
that sort of IT enterprise compromise

349
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,120
where adversaries once
they're in the environment,

350
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,740
they use built-in functionality
of windows computers

351
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,370
to sort of move about and
spread through an environment.

352
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,220
But what's interesting as well
is some rates more strains

353
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,660
including LockerGoga, Maze,
EKANS and a few others

354
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,079
also encrypt systems

355
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,020
via Windows Active Directory compromise.

356
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,132
You do see active directory installations

357
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,969
within OT environments,

358
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,750
as well acting as a domain controller.

359
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,300
And what might be interesting is that

360
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,879
oftentimes they're not
necessarily segmented.

361
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,579
Sometimes you still have the
CDC that is controlling IT

362
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,699
and OT functionalities.

363
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
And so there is a risk there

364
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,630
when the active directory is compromised

365
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,069
and a group policy object
for instance is used

366
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,810
to sort of push out the ransomware.

367
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,005
And so that is something
that is very very interesting

368
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,693
that we've seen there as well.

369
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,480
So one of the things that
I find very interesting

370
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,590
is this sort of new trend
of extortion, right?

371
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,810
So as companies and organizations

372
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,070
are getting increasingly
defensive and resilient

373
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,270
against ransomware that
it's having applied backups,

374
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,090
ensuring employees are trained
at tech phishing, et cetera.

375
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,360
Attackers are increasingly
data from target company

376
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,699
before actually encrypting
the affected machines.

377
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,860
And then we'll threaten
to publish the data online

378
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,240
either on attack websites
or hacking forums

379
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,003
if a ransom demand is not paid.

380
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,159
Ransomware actors may collaborate

381
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,700
with other criminal entities,

382
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,060
either via enlisting hackers via RaaS,

383
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,700
Ransomware-as-a-Service operations

384
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,370
like Sodinokibi and Netwalkwer

385
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,629
or collaborating on these sort
of extortion cartels, right?

386
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,120
So they're leaking this victim data

387
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,719
as part of a whole gang of affiliations

388
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,870
like the Maze gang with other operators.

389
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,209
This is very concerning
for a number of reasons.

390
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,510
And there are a number
of risks and consequences

391
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,340
that are involved with this
sort of double extortion

392
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,473
data theft technique.

393
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,129
One of the biggest ones
being the victims are unable

394
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,610
to confirm whether data
is actually destroyed.

395
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,899
Historically, with just kind
of traditional encryption

396
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,860
ransomware you pay the ransom
you get the encryption key,

397
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,693
get your stuff back.

398
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,129
The transaction has ended.

399
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,320
Unfortunately, now with this
sort of data theft piece,

400
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,770
victims have no idea what's
happening with their data

401
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,310
once it leaves their environment.

402
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,310
And there's no confirmation
or ability to know for sure

403
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,709
whether data is actually
destroyed if a ransom is paid.

404
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,570
This data could contain
sensitive information

405
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,409
on the target company or customers

406
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,340
that are working with the target company.

407
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,750
And this could actually aid
in future attack planning

408
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,490
for additional adversaries
that are interested

409
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,610
in collecting (indistinct)
data on this targeted company.

410
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,750
There are a lot of different
regulatory and legal issues

411
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,540
that arise from data breaches.

412
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,360
We have certainly here
in the United States,

413
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
there are a number of
countries around the world

414
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,490
that have a data breach
legislation and regulation

415
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,513
that says you must tell people
when their PII is stolen.

416
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,490
And so companies might find
themselves more pressured

417
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,560
to reveal these types of breaches.

418
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,500
Data leaks provide additional
incentive for victims

419
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,400
to pay a ransom yet when
paid ransoms validate

420
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,450
cybercriminals business model,

421
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,300
and encourage additional attack activity

422
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,730
from ransomware cartels.

423
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,650
Again wanting to pay the ransom,

424
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,710
historically, that is certainly
something that companies do

425
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,820
with the data leak.

426
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,760
Obviously it seems to be working

427
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,150
because ransomware
adversaries continue to do so.

428
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,423
And it does just sort of
encourage this ongoing activity.

429
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,210
Once the information is stolen,
victims have no control over

430
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,810
or visibility into what
attackers do with it.

431
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,419
That kind of goes back to
the first point, right?

432
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,170
There's no visibility into
whether it's destroyed.

433
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,580
Attackers could use it for
other nefarious purposes,

434
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,260
potentially sell it to other
criminal organizations,

435
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,400
et cetera.

436
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,950
And then finally releasing
sensitive intellectual property

437
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,700
could enable counterfeit products.

438
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,690
This is something that
could be of interest

439
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,250
to potential competitors,

440
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,540
to other adversaries
that are largely focused

441
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,090
on espionage and IP theft activities.

442
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,840
There's just a lot of
potential consequences

443
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,943
with the hack and leak operations.

444
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,057
So in one event, we actually
identified a company

445
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,430
that had been compromised by
a ransomware organization,

446
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,620
an oil and gas services company.

447
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,050
We did identify multiple items of interest

448
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,850
in the publicly available data leak.

449
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,100
So there was a list of companies

450
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,250
that use the firm's services,
employee information,

451
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,470
both of which could be used to facilitate

452
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,790
spear phishing activities,
natural gas flow data,

453
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,850
information related to Canadian
government energy regulator,

454
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,469
as well as geospatial data that
could be potentially related

455
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,920
to the company's current upstream
and midstream operations.

456
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,860
So when something like this happens,

457
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,370
really what is the impact?

458
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,419
So there are opportunities for third-party

459
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,820
or supply chain compromise,

460
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,139
understanding the targets
for phishing activity

461
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,280
and potentially using it again as a way

462
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,300
to sort of take advantage
of the trust built

463
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,200
between the company and its customers.

464
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
Sensitive financial data that could aid

465
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,120
in espionage operations and
potentially not in this case,

466
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,530
but potentially we have seen
schematics network diagrams

467
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,830
and other internal documentation
that has been published

468
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,159
that could be used to facilitate
ICS-specific compromise,

469
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,483
and potentially attacks.

470
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:03,210
And with that, I'll
hand it back to Camille.

471
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,470
- Thank you, Selena.

472
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,860
So from all of this research and findings,

473
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,610
we have several predictions for the future

474
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,840
of ransomware attacks
against ICS environments

475
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,970
going forward.

476
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,810
So first we predict that
ransomware will continue to be

477
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,590
a major threat to industrial operations.

478
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,090
These attacks are highly
profitable for cybercriminals,

479
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,419
arguably the most profitable
cyber criminal activity today.

480
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,390
And these profits are likely
to continue to attract

481
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,240
malicious actors to this space.

482
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,410
Second, blended data theft and extortion

483
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,410
and ransomware attacks that
Selena was just talking about

484
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,240
are likely to continue as this technique

485
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,320
which significantly increased
in popularity in 2020

486
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,939
has proven to be an
effective business model

487
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,240
for ransomware attackers.

488
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,460
Third, we anticipate the
future ransomware strains

489
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,667
will build on new efforts, such as EKANS

490
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:02,959
and be specially tailored
to ICS environments

491
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,950
particularly given how
lucrative ransomware attacks

492
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,010
find some ICS-related industries

493
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,470
such as manufacturing to be.

494
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,890
And last, we judge the data theft

495
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,310
and leak of information stolen
during ransomware attacks

496
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,303
will continue to provide
a better understanding

497
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:24,220
of the breadth and impact
of ransomware attacks.

498
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,610
So this is a helpful albeit
unfortunate side effect

499
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,399
of these attacks.

500
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,670
And now we're going to discuss
some defensive measures

501
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,400
organizations can take
against these attacks.

502
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,240
And I'll turn it over to Selena
to discuss our first slide

503
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,233
on this topic.

504
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,140
- Great, thanks Camille.

505
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,080
So really what you wanna do is
conduct architecture reviews

506
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,439
to identify all of your
assets, connections

507
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,250
and communications between
IT and OT networks.

508
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,600
You wanna critically examine
and limit the connections

509
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,709
between corporate and ICS
networks to only known

510
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,280
and required traffic.

511
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,110
Having visibility into your network,

512
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,919
having visibility of what
is communicating with what,

513
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,170
is it just one-way or
two-way communication?

514
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,020
What ports are open?

515
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,960
What type of traffic is
allowed within the environment

516
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,630
as well as sort of conducting
privilege assessments as well.

517
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,950
Are only the people who
are allowed to access

518
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,900
certain information or have
admin credentials having it

519
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,450
or is it kind of broadened
across the organization?

520
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,970
Especially for ransomware attacks

521
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,890
having effective preventative, detective

522
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,510
and corrective controls
in place is critical

523
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,640
for reducing risk.

524
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,200
This idea of sort of
defense in depth, right?

525
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,160
Having incident response plans,

526
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,470
having plans and protocols
in place to respond

527
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,910
to an attack.

528
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,810
You also wanna enforce
multi-factor authentication

529
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,050
wherever possible.

530
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,250
Focus critically on
connections to integrators,

531
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,590
maintenance, vendor
personnel and crown jewels,

532
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,860
such as safety equipment.

533
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,600
And we've seen in events
where there's for instance,

534
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,340
RDP compromise, that's
exposed to the internet

535
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,811
with no multifactor
authentication implemented,

536
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:05,659
MFA could have potentially been enough

537
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,593
to prevent exploitation.

538
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,560
- Great, thanks so much Selena.

539
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,889
And in addition, we definitely
recommend having backups

540
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,790
to both enterprise and operations networks

541
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,750
that are maintained daily and tested.

542
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,950
From our experience,

543
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,870
more companies are doing this successfully

544
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,570
which is great to see,

545
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,939
and which enables them to recover quickly

546
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,580
from a ransomware attack

547
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,850
without having to pay
for a decryption key.

548
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,270
This does not necessarily
solve the problem of stolen

549
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,500
and leaked data,

550
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,610
but it does help in getting
back up and running quickly.

551
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,510
And that is critical.

552
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,300
And we have also found the companies

553
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,950
that have been able to
successfully establish

554
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,560
an alternate location for
business critical functions

555
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,510
are able to recover faster,
experience less fallout

556
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,660
from a ransomware attack
and position themselves well

557
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,660
for recovering and avoiding
having to pay the ransom.

558
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,890
So on our last slide here,

559
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,070
just to conclude some of the main points

560
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,129
from our presentation today,

561
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,740
our research revealed a 500%
increase in ransomware attacks

562
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,010
from 2018 to 2020,

563
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,440
with 56% of those attacks

564
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,220
affecting operations functionality.

565
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,190
We found that manufacturing was
the hardest hit ICS industry

566
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,150
by far.

567
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,780
And that North America
is bearing the brunt

568
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,470
of these ICS ransomware attacks.

569
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,440
Attackers are increasingly
stealing and then leaking data

570
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,620
in addition to encrypting
it and holding it for ransom

571
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,209
which is changing victim's calculus

572
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,863
on whether or not to pay.

573
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,960
And we predict that
these ransomware attacks

574
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,210
will continue to be a major threat

575
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,000
to industrial organizations.

576
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,250
And if you'd like to read more

577
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,660
we have linked here on
the slide, a white paper

578
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,690
that Selena and I wrote on this topic.

579
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,510
And then on our very last slide,

580
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,530
we'd just like to say that we
are happy to have a discussion

581
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,170
about these topics here
on the RSA platform.

582
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,850
And we're also sharing here
our contact information

583
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,030
should you have any follow-up questions.

584
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,863
Thank you.

585
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,783
- Thank you so much.
