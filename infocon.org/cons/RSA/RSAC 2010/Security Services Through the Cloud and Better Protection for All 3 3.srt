1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
that with Intel VMware and the newest
addition to the IRS a family

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,660
Archer technologies demonstrating
exactly how

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,210
this visibility can be accomplished and
you can see the proof of concept

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,440
in the EMC both focused on accelerating

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,980
you're secure virtualization journey
while the advent

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,820
out cloud infrastructures built on a
measured chain up trust

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
is not a cure-all for cloud security and
compliance

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,630
this does mark an important milestone
matter fact some

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,850
analysts didn't believe we would get
there until somewhere around

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,370
2012 the hardware and virtualization
layers

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,590
formally a black box within the cloud

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,140
now becomes as inspector will analyze a
lil

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,500
and reportable for compliance as the
clouds

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,199
topmost application services layer with
this previously

15
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,590
unimagined level undone %uh visibility
cloud providers can develop the

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,020
infrastructure level the policy controls

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,140
and and two and security at test
stations

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,200
to handle the most demanding security
requirements

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
up their customers so

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,100
these are the four stages that represent
the journey

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,140
but the larger point here is that we do

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,750
no heil to surmount these challenges

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,009
let's hear now from Dave colony

24
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,310
chief security officer love e-bay shari

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,350
his unique perspective as a practitioner

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,970
cloud service provider and founding
member

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,520
on the cloud security Alliance hi my
name's take on a non the chief

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,670
information security officer in the bay

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,009
high technology will not only transform
the IT industry

30
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,130
and how are companies maximize their IT
investment

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,759
it has the potential to significantly
transform the information security

32
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,450
professional itself

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,910
clouds and virtualization are critical
to you made to create the rapid

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,929
development and deployment capability

35
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,170
that is key to enabling our ability to
continuously innovate

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,540
and continuously delight our customers
deals worth talking about

37
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,800
EVA has been heavily involved in the USU
cloud technology for some time

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,270
in fact you could say that he may is a
cloud provider

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,459
in that we provide platform as a service
and even Application Platform as a

40
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,069
Service

41
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:39,150
to our customers today are you so cloud
and virtualization grows continuously

42
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,780
which is why he may co founded and
continues to support

43
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,879
the Cloud Security Alliance that was
announced at last year's arce conference

44
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,519
I want to encourage all the vendors
represented here at the conference

45
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,860
to work together to provide the
technologies we need to secure the cloud

46
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,110
infrastructure in a seamless and
cost-effective way

47
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,330
this is our chance to embed security

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,060
right into the infrastructure and few
practitioners I'd like you to challenge

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,980
us who provide cloud services

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,819
to demonstrate that we can indeed give
you an environment that is more secure

51
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,560
that exist today in our physical
infrastructure thank you

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,940
thanks Ted by now

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,010
to thing should be clear the journey to
the cloud

54
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,860
is inevitable and we're going to have to
secure it

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,959
but the fact is we're being presented
with an

56
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
opportunity to advance information
security

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,720
be on anything else since the advent

58
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,680
unencrypted cloud infrastructures will
catapult us forward because they force

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,769
enterprises to focus on their security

60
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,120
policies and processes not just

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,269
security technologies think about it if
we can get security

62
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,019
built into the virtual infrastructure
from the get-go

63
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,129
we can not only have visibility and
manageability

64
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,280
but risk decision points and controls

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,189
everywhere in short the cloud will turn
the way we deliver security

66
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:21,669
inside out and information security will
enable cloud computing to take

67
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,740
full advantage on the Internet turning
our current

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,759
it. models inside out as well

69
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
this means we can deliver new waves in
the fish in sea

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,500
agility and collaboration for
organizations

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,290
up all sizes and yes

72
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,430
it will be challenging but history
reminds us

73
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,060
that we've managed through sweeping
transformations

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,680
from the physical to the virtual world

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,070
like to leave you with one more
historical example

76
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,699
consider how r monetary system evolved

77
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,080
we started with Potter my chickens

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,150
for your grain klein's made money more
portable

79
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,520
but you still have to carry your actual
wealth

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,340
along with you paper currency

81
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,310
began virtualizing wealth these
promissory notes with no intrinsic value

82
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,320
required us to start dealing with the
concept

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,600
%uh at s station certify that something

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,830
is genuine what ru

85
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,729
the banking system right service
providers into the mix with credit card

86
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,520
in ATM networks

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,930
and with the advent a financial
instruments lawns

88
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,190
stocks mutual funds et cetera we found
ways to share well so that when one

89
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,370
party wasn't using it

90
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,639
another could as an all this sound
familiar

91
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,770
of course virtual money has dominated
the money supply

92
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,770
for decades and along the way

93
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,650
we've had to think about standards
regulations

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,650
federation between organizations and
more

95
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,710
all because money must be based

96
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,759
on trust now

97
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,860
no system is perfect every system has
its abuses

98
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,020
and unintended consequences

99
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,449
but what we ever go back the chechans
for grain

100
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,900
not likely cloud computing will indeed
complete the transformation

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,759
%uh IT infrastructures unleashed by the
Internet

102
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,770
as security practitioners we must lead

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,419
not follow and after 15 years in this
business

104
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,199
I know we've got what it takes to
embrace the challenge

105
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,199
and seize the opportunity

106
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,160
good luck along the journey and here's
to a great conference

107
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,949
thank you very much for
