1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,589
good morning it's a pleasure to be here
again you know I was here last year

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,839
talking about our intent Russell vision
in progress we made.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,070
and you know this is actually my
anniversary with Microsoft that now been

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,210
with the company since 2002

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,800
so eight years it's really interesting
because I went to the company we just

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,560
started the trustworthy computing
initiative right on in March 1st 2002

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,779
Bill Gates announced the initiative on
january 15 to that year

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,019
so you know where night here this
journey

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,730
has been a very very interesting journey
and it continues to change

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,040
it started of course with us focusing on
the PC

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,780
when I first got to Microsoft we started
with sp3 secure by design secure by

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,550
default security deployment

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,770
it was really about protecting the PC

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,530
from the onslaught set were coming but
over time of course we recognize that

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,980
wasn't just about protecting the PC

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,210
was about protecting ecosystem so we
started to think about the end to

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,820
entrust

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,930
vision how do we actually creates a
safer

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,960
more private ecosystem and then of
course in the last year or two the cloud

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
has become the Big Bus

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,780
everyone's talking about the class
sewers

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,369
planet natural for me to think about
okay we have this

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,549
and entrust vision has it relate to the
cloud doesn't work in the cloud

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,640
what changes and something to talk about
a couple things today

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,470
1i wanna talk about our progress on on
can trust generally

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,470
I also want to talk about how and 10
trust

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,520
is affected by the cloud and I'm awesome
gonna show you a video and talk about a

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,030
little bit about our products

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,040
and the reason for that is Island you
know

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,869
corporate staff job I think about
strategy and policy issues

31
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,030
but whether we're actually a factual
aiding against that strategy

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,920
depends on whether it actually turns up
in your products and serves

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,930
not just for Microsoft but for the
entire industry

34
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,710
its great to talk about how important it
is to think about identity

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,680
differently but if people aren't
building identity technologies

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,200
what's the point and its greatest talk
about the fact that we can harmonize

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,160
identity and privacy and we can have
authenticated worlds but still protect

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
anonymity

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,459
but what's the point of having that
discussion if you don't effectuate it in

40
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,360
your products

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,260
someone to talk about all of those
things today now

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,360
before I do talk about the cloud I wanna

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,629
remind people about what the enhanced
vision was and I also wanna talk

44
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,190
about the current box product world
because while the cloud is

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,200
the buzz today the reality is

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,300
there's still a lot of people all over
the world

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,209
running traditional box products dealing
with up range of threats

48
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,420
but here in a nutshell was the intent
restoration really has four different

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,370
components

50
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,080
the first is that we have to do the
fundamentals right we have to design

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,970
products to be secure

52
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,879
we have to deploy them in a secure state
yes to help customers keep them secure

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,599
we need to do defense in depth
technologies we all know that there's no

54
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,629
silver bullet

55
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,180
but this is about risk mitigation not
risk elimination

56
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,319
and we need to be able to respond to
specific threats

57
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,640
additionally we need to start building
the trusted stat

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,629
and we heard someone that in the earlier
keynote satellite for example about the

59
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:24,250
need to

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,549
ru trust in hardware we need to know
that the software is from the source we

61
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,500
think it's Ron

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,470
that the applications assigned that the
data is coming from the people we expect

63
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,519
we also need to think about identity and
identity is so important in the context

64
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,250
that the internet generally

65
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,319
and actually becomes an amplified issue
in the cloud that identity get it

66
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,670
own place in the stack and you know I've
been involved in the identity space now

67
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,299
for over 18 years

68
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,319
I used to go to conferences center
Democracy and technology creating a

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,739
computer screen in privacy conferences

70
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,769
and they would put government people up
and they were but civil libertarians up

71
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,129
for the big debate

72
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,849
about identity and the question was
always phrased

73
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,480
do you want anonymity or accountability

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,769
on the Internet the answer is

75
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,500
yes we did and when you have an answer
like that to a question you realize that

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,529
you're asking the wrong question

77
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,060
and so one of the things we've come to
recognize as we can think about the

78
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,759
internet as the thing

79
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,169
you have to think about the application
layer as the thing

80
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,810
there were places where you want robust
accountability on all sides at the

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,160
transaction

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,199
a classic example online banking

83
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,360
I the bank wants to know it's me I want
the bank to know it's me

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,949
but there are other places particularly
things like free speech

85
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,300
we may want a large degree of anonymity
so that you can protect the value of

86
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,030
free speech so people can say
controversial things

87
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,310
just important have a nuanced discussion
about identity

88
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,009
and of course as you build distrusted
stacking you put identity on the top

89
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,350
how you manage all of this how we cannot
audit so when things go wrong we can

90
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,320
roll things back and figure out what
happened

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,680
and finally and 10 trust is about
creating alignment

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,449
alignment between social forces
political forces

93
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,860
economic forces and IT products and
services

94
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,419
if you don't create that alignment you
may have great technology

95
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,870
that is economically unsustainable or
objected to by many

96
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,130
and so you have to figure out sometimes
that the politicians want to do

97
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,310
something like protect children online a
noble cause

98
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,590
but the technology doesn't allow age
verification so the laws are overbroad

99
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,539
and get struck down by the strip Supreme
Court

100
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,380
you always have to think about this
alignment issue if you can't find

101
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,600
alignment

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,680
you will have trouble so I wanted to
talk about

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,860
the traditional threat for a minute the
box product rats

104
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,910
and botnet in particular because they
pose a very interesting problem

105
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,470
you know I just heard of a moment ago in
the award ceremony

106
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,630
the discussion that we you know we have
to be careful how we describe the threat

107
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,630
that we not be there over-hyped that are
underestimated

108
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,009
and I agree with that completely
completely

109
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,520
but in a lot of my dealings both with
industry with government with consumers

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,580
people have really struggles to
understand the threat

111
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,580
is the sky is falling thing sometimes
some people diminish the threat some

112
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
people exaggerate the threat

113
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,479
everyone is struggling to get there arms
around them threat

114
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,750
so I just started thinking about why is
it so why is it so hard to understand

115
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,110
this tract

116
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,419
because you know we deal with all sorts
of things in our lives when we cross the

117
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,110
street we know what the threat is real I
get hit by a car running a red light

118
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,419
and we know how to mitigate it and we
have statistics that show us

119
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,229
this thread happens actually materialize
as a certain percentage of the time

120
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,160
people get here

121
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,199
we can get our arms around it and then
we can mitigated

122
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
but in the cyber world we have so much
difficulty getting our arms around the

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,250
threat

124
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,860
so I started to think about why that's
true

125
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,169
and ultimately I think they're kinda
five issues that really highlight the

126
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,410
problem

127
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,660
push the ball there are a lot of bad
actors out there

128
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,330
and there many types a bad actors this
criminals

129
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,449
is organized crime groups yes activists

130
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,240
there are those committing economic
espionage a military & espionage

131
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,300
you see reports about nation-state
activity

132
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,039
you have individuals teenagers and
sophisticated organizations there are so

133
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
many types and actors

134
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,789
and there are so many types of motives

135
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,080
this traditional motives like Frodo
distribution of child pornography

136
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,889
they're more sophisticated motives like
economic espionage a military espionage

137
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,750
their cutting-edge motives like cyber
warfare

138
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,629
save a lot so that actors and lotsa
motives

139
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:02,650
the next problem is their attacks can
look the same

140
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,550
you see an attack on a network it
doesn't tell you anything about who the

141
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,410
actor or the motive

142
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,410
might be and if you don't know the actor
is and what their motives arch

143
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,819
very hard to figure out how to respond
and so you have this kind of amorphous

144
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,979
threat

145
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,410
it some actor there are many with some
older

146
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,430
there are many doing something I can
tell what it is

147
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,470
and they're doing it in a shared an
integrated domain

148
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,750
it shared by consumers by businesses

149
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,380
by governments and its integrated you
can t use these things apart

150
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,610
the camp with consumers over here and
the military over here

151
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,680
we've done that in the physical world we
know where the battlefields are we know

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,680
where the hospitals are but you know
mine just together

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,790
and the fifth point is that the worst
case scenarios

154
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,459
I devastating and dramatic and scary

155
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,690
said you don't know who's acting what
their motive is

156
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,920
you can tell from their attacks it in
this integrated domain with so many

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,269
things can go wrong

158
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,220
and the worst case scenarios a horrible
suddenly you get stuck

159
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,649
you get into Prouse and that's why we
have trouble grappling with the threat

160
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,570
and against that backdrop we can start
to think about how to handle these

161
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,130
things in a slightly different way at
least one we know where there's

162
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,370
attribution

163
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,000
and we know where we can assign motive
and we can start thinking about what to

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,570
do in the cases with no we can't

165
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,810
and linking create a different framework
for this

166
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,870
and then against that contact is very
interesting to think about but nets

167
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,080
because botnet exemplifies the problem

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,700
in this environment and 20 can be very
challenging there are many but it's now

169
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,050
that are responsible for a lot of types
of criminal activity

170
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,080
everything from spam to
denial-of-service attacks

171
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,029
there are millions a botnet it computers
around the world

172
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,310
and most of them are consumer computers
which raises

173
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,899
interesting problems about how we
