1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,820
a so we have to start thinking about you
know innovation

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,100
innovation in both disruption

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,240
and Prevention so one of the things we
did Microsoft as we look at a particular

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,889
botnet

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:17,330
that was responsible for a lotta
nefarious activities

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,350
this but that was the top 10 botnet in
39 countries

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,240
hotmail along blocked over $650 million
connections from infected computers

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,970
the Malicious Software Removal Tool that
we run is part of what

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,200
automatic update cleaned almost 200,000

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,469
infected machines so knowing that we had
this problem

11
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,700
it was an opportunity to innovate about
both disruption

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,270
and to start thinking about innovating
about prevention

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,550
so had we think about disruption

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,000
well one of the things we did as we turn
to the courts

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,110
as I said we always have to align not
just social political economic an IT

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,850
forces

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,100
but we need to use social mechanisms and
political mechanisms to reinforce values

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,159
if you think this behavior is wrong in
society should do something about it in

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,270
a structured way

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,689
so one of the things we did is we use
the court process

21
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,840
we went did a court filing it was
supported by industry partners in

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,790
academia

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,320
we got temporary orders to sever the
domains we notified the people to

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,070
domains were affected

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,409
we waited 14 days and then we could
terminate

26
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,240
basically the head up the botnet now

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,430
it's an interesting idea as something
that we will continue to pursue is

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,200
appropriate

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,720
I don't mean to suggest this is a remedy
for the botnet problem medicine

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,520
the point is that just like we do
defense in depth in it.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,090
we have to do defense in-depth in
response

32
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,409
we have to think about technical
solutions such as cleaning machines

33
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,880
and we need to think about social
solutions like using the court in

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,299
getting

35
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,850
people involved so to me of course this
was an interesting

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,390
way to proceed but Utah so

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,280
raises an obvious question this is
reactive

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,110
what do we do proactively to change the
problem so we've started to think about

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,650
this

40
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,890
I actually think that the health care
model

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,700
particularly related to the World Health
Organization and the Center for Disease

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,739
Control

43
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,209
in other countries have similar
organizations and authorities

44
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,970
might be an interesting way to think
about the problem with medical diseases

45
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,110
we basically educate people

46
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,610
and sometimes if you fly into certain
countries else can you for your

47
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,480
temperature you get off the plane

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,510
if you seem to be infected your
quarantined

49
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,030
and you're treated the question is why
don't we do this

50
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,950
for consumers why don't we think about
access providers who are doing

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,879
Inspection and Quarantine

52
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,300
and cleaning machines prior to access to
the Internet

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,610
now in the region has become so
important

54
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,790
is if you look back at the end ten trust
paper which was actually written a

55
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,330
couple years ago there's a line

56
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,480
in it it says who's the CIO for the
public sector

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,140
the reason government in enterprises can
manage the botnet

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,440
risk is because they have protect
professional IT staff this is their job

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,330
they manage this risk is much more
complicated in the consumer space

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,220
me when the things I love to do is just
look at my own life and when things I've

61
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,860
done is

62
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,040
the I have three children and I have my
mother whose fortunately still healthy

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,459
as someone at the sandwich generation
and that the mom

64
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,209
and I've got the kids and every now and
then I Jux the post my four-and-a-half

65
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:37,780
year old

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,780
with my eighty-year-old mother in part
because

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,900
baby he is so much like it just the
stands me but let me tell you one way

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,730
they also behave like my 4 1/2 year old

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,970
has learned to navigate without my house
as just great to watch enough to get to

70
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,519
the house

71
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,870
up pops a security dialogue he can read

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,099
he doesn't understand it he clicks okay

73
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,590
then I go to my mom she's got a PhD in
education

74
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,890
she gets the dialog pops she can read

75
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,959
she doesn't understand that and she
clicks okay okay

76
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,790
week we can't do it that way anymore

77
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,320
the attacks are happening at light speed
we have to respond lights be so we

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,030
should think about Inspection and
Quarantine other some obvious questions

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,180
why should we be doing this to people
will people accepted socially and

80
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,850
politically

81
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,259
well we've done it was smoking people
use to smoke and we said look you're

82
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,090
gonna kill yourself but if you wanna die

83
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,229
go ahead causing cost to the health care
system

84
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,940
will eat those costs go ahead and tell
yourself then

85
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,780
of course the EPA comes out a second
hand smoke certainly smoking is banned

86
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,840
everywhere you have a right to inspect

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,449
and give yourself illness you don't have
the right to infect your neighbor

88
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,729
well the commuters are the same way we
told people run anti-virus

89
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,440
catch back up your data but if you don't
do that stuff and you lose all your

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,530
stuff that's a risk you can accept

91
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,570
but today you're not a just accepting it
for yourself

92
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,660
you contaminating everyone around you

93
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,979
right and we do this another is like
vaccinations if you have kids to go to

94
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,220
public schools they get vaccinated or
they don't

95
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,360
the whole we do those and enforce

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,830
and then there's the question of who
will pay for that well maybe markets

97
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,410
will make it work but if not

98
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,699
there are other models to use taxes for
those who use the internet we pay a fee

99
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,100
to put phone service in rural areas we
pay a tax on our

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,930
airline ticket for security you can say
it's a public safety issue and do it

101
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,289
with general taxation

102
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,199
and there's also a good role for
government here if access providers are

103
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,479
gonna scan for content what content

104
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,970
can they scan for if you want to protect
networks in yet the limit the activity

105
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,120
to network protecting active

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,630
not worry about copyrighted material
speech other kinds of things

107
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,020
but we do have to innovate and this
example gives you

108
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,389
another reason to constantly think about
alignment how would you get social

109
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,539
acceptance

110
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,220
political acceptance find the right
economic model

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,569
and have I T which does still of course
things like that happen act today

112
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,910
how to use it. to achieve these
objectives

113
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,300
so we have some interesting
opportunities here now let me talk about

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,680
the cloud because the cloud is the big
thing for sure let me

115
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,020
make sure we're talking about the same
thing you know the National Institute of

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Standards and Technology has done a
great deal

117
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,449
and talking about cloud definitions
there's infrastructure we just rent the

118
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,490
hardware

119
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,069
there's the platform when you get the
operating system Microsoft has ensured

120
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,800
that on the platform

121
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,020
and then there's the total outsource
model infrastructure

122
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,039
operating platform and applications
right

123
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,979
and they'll be different kinds of class
of the public clouds private clouds

124
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,509
hybrid clouds

125
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,680
to be clear these models are not
completely new

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,770
people have outsourced in the past and
put their data with third parties

127
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,370
consumers are used to things like
Hotmail which is a Software as a Service

128
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,620
but what is different about this class
what makes this different

129
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,789
is a couple that tribute still be some
new platforms like the operating system

130
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,990
for the clout that dynamically allocate
resources

131
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,780
there will be global elasticity you'll
be able to participate in various places

132
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,220
all over the world

133
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,650
on the fly again might not even know
where your data is

134
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,300
and there's Co tenancy I talked about
you know Coke and Pepsi would wanna

135
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,650
share the same hardware but there will
be co tenants in the cloud

136
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,690
and as a result that that create a bunch
implications for those of us in the

137
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,819
security and

138
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:45,910
privacy space the first has to do with
the shifting shared accountabilities

139
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,419
so in the box product well we develop a
product we give it to you and then you

140
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:50,289
go out

141
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,310
and you configured and patches and do
that management work

142
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,050
depending on which cloud model you use
you take on

143
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,610
more or less responsibility in the cloud

144
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,009
and they'll be challenges for compliance
because the fact that to date is in the

145
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,080
compliance

146
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
in the cloud doesn't mean you don't have
compliance obligations

147
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,410
moving all the data together in the
cloud can create which targets

148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,060
for bad guys to go after and they'll be
the question is how you do shared

149
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,759
investigations I'll talk more about this
in a minute

150
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,860
to be a lotta information aggregation in
the cloud

151
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,710
and questions about what the cloud
provider can do with that information

152
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,479
and they'll be questions about
jurisdiction which I'll talk about to

153
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,839
so if we think about the cloud
implications that I can start to think

154
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,070
about the end and trust vision

155
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,219
and how it impacted by the class first
is more important than ever that we do

156
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,080
the fundamentals right and that your
cloud provider do the fundamentals right

157
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
because you're increasingly gonna be
relying on that third party if you're

158
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,149
using a platform was that platform
developed with the security development

159
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,000
life cycle on Mon

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,510
can you you know ensure that the cloud
providers using the same way good that

161
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,769
you would use

162
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,850
is one of the things to think about we
have to think about privacy centric

163
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,459
models

164
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,440
so how does the cloud provider what
rights if any do they reserve to use

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,390
your data

166
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,630
and how are they going to respond to
threats in the class

167
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,660
the trusted stack becomes important as I
talked about

168
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,269
we need to route to trust in hardware
but it's gonna be virtualization

169
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,580
that is the key to keeping the tenant
separate

170
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,260
so how we gonna make sure those
virtualize compartments a secure

171
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,320
as we move up the stack from the
hardware audit is going to increase in

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,580
importance as we try and figure out what
happened to the data

173
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,300
and how we gonna do forensics
investigations and the clap

174
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,930
you know not long ago there was a
hospital that

175
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,310
not contacted by a bad guy who said they
had stolen data and if they want

176
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,970
paid money they would release the data
and they shared some of that data to

177
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,290
show that was really a compromise

178
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,630
suppose that data had been in the clout
the hospital cause a cloud provider and

179
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,940
says we think you lost a day
