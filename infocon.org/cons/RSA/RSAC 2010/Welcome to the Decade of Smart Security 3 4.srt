1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,590
domains like I tell the IT
Infrastructure Library

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,940
or cobe it of course I so 27001 from a
security

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,900
control perspective the integration of
these best practices

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,719
allows organizations to make sure that
they are functioning properly

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,210
within a set of control limits to
deliver the services that are expected

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,420
return mandated

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,439
in an increasingly interconnected in
complex and intelligent world

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,580
so that I p.m. we talk to our clients
about this

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,670
idea up integrated service management

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,910
in some ways as the operating system for
this

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,280
this idea the smarter planet we speak
with them about the idea of a service

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,239
life cycle

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,120
in what you think about how'd you will
deal with service quality

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,539
and vulnerabilities at the time you're
creating the services

15
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,910
we speak to our clients about automating
the process is

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,399
visualizing status in production and
controlling desired stay

17
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,609
now interestingly while it's been found
that

18
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:04,220
organizations today will turn to any
number

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,229
best practices on for guidance on which
controls to implement

20
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,520
again this can be driven by regulations
that can be driven by

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,299
industry geography or even corporate
culture what we found is that

22
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,740
it is adherence to the Tesla plans up
integrated service management

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,759
that we see setting the highest
performers

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,680
in the areas of security management
apart integrated service management

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,900
is key to securing the new services that
we will create

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,840
in this decade a smart drive down the
cost and

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,790
a and casa implementing and maintaining
service infrastructure

28
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,970
but it also minimizes human hair and it
provides

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,470
data and insights a to measure and to
prove compliance

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,579
also integral to the creation of
software

31
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,820
in the development process %uh resulting
in again security that's built into

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,189
applications we use

33
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,210
that create the new services that we're
talking about

34
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,579
see every business every government
regardless of their industry

35
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,209
or home continent will need strong
integrated service management

36
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,709
capabilities

37
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,950
to deliver things like smarter bridges
smarter utility grids

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,780
smarter farm smarter waterways and even
smarter backed

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,170
so at IBM

40
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,730
we're focused on this area of innovation

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,220
each year we fun extensive research

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,560
in the areas have integrated service
management and especially

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,379
in IT security with the goal up
improving

44
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,300
the security aspect of integrated
service management and undressing

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,220
these inhibitors the deploying the
smarter services in fact we think this

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,540
whole cult notion

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,650
as smarter security work directly with
clients

48
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,390
and business partners like many the
organizations represented here

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,510
but to test and implement the
breakthroughs that we are

50
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,340
all driving an integrated hardware
platforms encryption

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,370
risk analytics and overall security

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,530
architecture %uh the decade have smart
calls for

53
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,900
highly refined security risk analytics

54
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,050
successful rescan Prada analytics

55
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,030
that require really three very important
elements at the course trust the data

56
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,640
second it's all about quality quality

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,150
analytics and third it's about the
ability to disseminate these analytics

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,569
for the correct decision makers and
supported the business processes and

59
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,269
outcomes

60
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,540
that they drive at IBM

61
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,030
we're looking to advance this state up
the art and we're working with

62
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,129
advance risk calculators to bribe faster
processing

63
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:49,269
up to fifteen to twenty times today's
models even in multi-tenant architecture

64
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,159
is like cloud computing

65
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,580
you are researchers are working on
smarter cyber security technologies

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,209
aimed at providing a smart in a
scaleable way

67
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,720
monitoring all the environments that we
need to

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,879
understand yet today security controls

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,989
in management systems to a fair job is
enabling enterprises to get a better

70
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:11,890
handle

71
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,350
on their security posture but they also
create as we all know

72
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,459
a multitude of the event alerts strains
as well as logs

73
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,680
up an audit records all these things
contain precious intelligence

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,810
but far too often their insufficiently
minder

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,669
or analyze so this inability to
consolidate Inc or laid

76
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,070
I love these service affecting event and
log data

77
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,210
and do so at wire speeds

78
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,810
is really a and then present it to the
proper people who can perform the

79
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,240
analysis and do so in a semantically
meaningful manner

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,560
I love this Rob security analyst and
administrators about people tools that

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,259
they need to defend

82
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,720
enterprise networks your our researchers
are working on ways

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
to exploit this existing instrumentation
so we don't have to

84
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,990
ask our clients to redo a lot in the
instrumentation in today's networks and

85
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,919
data centers

86
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,940
or working with the suggesting
instrumentation to create semantically

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,539
reg interpretations security network
events

88
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:19,699
through the application of streaming
analytics

89
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,560
that scale to extremely large networks
networks well be on

90
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,590
that networks that we see in today's
organizations

91
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,830
at this will enable for correlation up
all service affecting events

92
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,430
across the security domains that use a
domain and the fall

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,520
network domain this technology
interactively creates an automatically

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,720
checks behavior models

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,490
up for malware detection in real time
providing pre fraud detection

96
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,750
wet extremely low false positive rates

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,830
the smarter cyber security effort that
I'm talking about here

98
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,630
aims to put comprehensive and actor
control back in the hands of real

99
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,720
decision makers

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,300
such as security analyst by taking over
repetitive

101
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,000
and manual tasks enabling these analyst
the focus on

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,360
remediating issues as they come up in
guiding

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,259
the a driving a framework that is a real
secure or

104
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,300
type feedback loop

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,770
now we also continue to research and
test

106
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,389
new more rowboat robust them focused
approach is

107
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,520
enterprise security we're really
delighted the one for breakthroughs

108
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,009
recently resulted

109
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,050
in the International Association of
privacy professionals

110
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,110
honoring IBM Research as one of the top
privacy innovators

111
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,210
in 2009 it did this because I be amiss
develop

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,030
a landmark data encryption technique
called fully homomorphic encryption

113
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,300
which is quite frankly alluded
researchers worldwide for more than 30

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,280
years

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,289
our technique removes a major roadblock
encryption mathematics

116
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,680
and paves the way for advance research
up for

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,110
future services that required d and
unlimited

118
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,139
analysis 7 encrypt that information
without sacrificing

119
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,630
any confidentiality this means that
service providers using leading-edge

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,940
delivery models like loud

121
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,139
one the what they'll need this type of
encryption

122
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,830
to be able to store confidential
electronic data about others

123
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,139
and be able to fully analyze that data
on the client's behalf

124
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,590
without extensive interaction expensive
interaction with clients

125
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,810
an without saying any above the client's
private data

126
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,530
now in the future this technique will
allow companies governments really

127
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,550
individuals

128
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,569
the store their most sensitive and
secret proprietary information

129
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,680
literally anywhere on any clout I

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,080
and now have the ability to access it at
their convenience

131
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,500
all the time while it remains completely
secure

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,300
and private now these research projects
that have gone over here

133
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,500
are all examples areas we believe are
going to be critical

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,650
to the introduction up more advanced yet
secure

135
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,849
services that are an outgrowth up the
smarter planet idea

136
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,879
this these capabilities again as we talk
about them here today at this

137
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,639
conference are really going to help us
address these issues have complexity

138
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,539
and it's really know this impact to the
reserve a stone

139
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,490
idea that has inspired is here we
wondered

140
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,820
if in fact there was a way that we can
help all about you all the audience gain

141
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,880
more insight

142
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,550
into this journey that the decade a
smart will take us all on

143
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,350
and so today I'm pleased to announce the
creation

144
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,720
up the IBM Institute for Advanced
Security this is an institute that is

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,890
aimed at enabling cyber security
innovation

146
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,010
in collaboration across multiple
entities

147
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,970
so be directed by doctor charles Parmer
some view know him very well

148
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,510
is one of our most famous researchers
and security

149
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,070
in the Institute will bring IBM security
expertise

150
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,080
the government organizations our
partners

151
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,959
academia our clients and all these
organizations that are involved in

152
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,120
better serving

153
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,230
the public sector yes the two will be
supported by IBM's

154
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,320
security scientists our researchers the
x-force

155
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,899
our consultants no organized briefings
on advanced technology in

156
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,350
strategies for stated make sure that we
provide thought leadership on the issues

157
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,990
that

158
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,480
