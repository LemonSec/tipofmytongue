1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,190
defeating Germany was built on a united
front we stopped playing defense and we

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,900
push back

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,809
day by day there is no one country
standing alone that could have ended

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:17,490
that war and the same is in some ways
true today in this new context

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,699
no one country no one company

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,910
no one agency can't stop cybercrime a
bar the windows in both the doors

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,260
mentality will not

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,309
totally insure our collective safety for
churches will not hold forever

9
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,090
walls will one day fall down and we must
start at the source we must find those

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,170
responsible the only way to do that is
by standing together

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,030
together we can find better ways to
safeguard our systems

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,370
and stop and incarcerate those who would
do us harm

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,110
for only we face the same threat we both

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,719
you and I serve the american people and
we must continue to do everything we can

15
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,059
together to minimize and stop

16
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,270
these attacks now before I

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,770
a finish up I one last word my good
friend I understand Janet Napolitano

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,930
stood on this stage couple days ago and
encouraged

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,360
those have you in the audience to sign
up with the Department of Homeland sure

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,460
Homeland Security I also

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,140
want to send out an imitation those have
you in the audience

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,829
you would like to serve the country to
join the FBI and if you'd like to join

23
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:32,950
the FBI

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,250

the Marine Corps

25
