1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,710
but agents everywhere every type a
computing device

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,450
skater type devices anything as an IP
address

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,210
can have an agent managed centrally

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,519
cross both network an endpoint critical

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,289
probably the most interesting thing to
be done here

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,539
is to make it open sounds like heresy

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,330
few years back open up the
architecture's up security

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,330
but this is probably the most important
thing we can all do

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,030
how to make all of our products in Iraq
operate together

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,219
to correlate threats across specter's
the share for intelligence

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,809
and enable loss to solve some of these
problems in real time a big part of what

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,940
we've tried to do here the last three
years as

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,110
open up this architecture tried on the
phone number vendors

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,390
integrate to it so that it doesn't
always have to be a McAfee product there

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,550
but to manage in a way is a big open

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,430
architecture community and Lisa Mack his
case with more than 100 partners

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,040
immigrated to the spring work now

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,619
many from our competitors to the company
but we believe probably the most

19
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,350
important thing we could have done

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,040
was a crane in ROP ability framework for
which all these products can communicate

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,860
share

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,990
in Chorley and to do so really to the
biggest thing we've tried to do

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,659
is bill the cloud intelligence
repository this could enable us now did

24
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,670
not just to malware reputation

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,220
but application reputations web
reputations

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,570
identity reputations to serve any type
of device

27
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,729
in the corporate enterprises government
entities

28
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:45,840
were consumer environment so we think
about what we can do to solve this

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,250
these are the keys higher protection
lower-cost

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,490
move the communications through making
easier to manage

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,490
some the screens will see appears

32
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,250
all kinds of ways for us the creative
you for that entire dashboard how do we

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,829
think about different roles that can
look at the entire

34
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:09,110
architecture here in our case is called
EP a so our security management console

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,989
things that enable an IT Architect to
look at the entire operations on the

36
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,780
network the end point every device

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,989
a way of looking at all feeds from the
cloud

38
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,510
correlate that to a risk remediate at
risk

39
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,170
and understand how to do that in real
time through an architecture this gives

40
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,730
us a complete control

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,459
complete window to entire operations for
security

42
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,980
and really probably most importantly
make interoperable

43
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,560
everything in architecture whether it's
a back-end systems management console

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,720
like HP BMC RCA or

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,980
to anyone in the security vendors that
are here as well so their data can be

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,640
rolled up in reported through the
framework the same way

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,019
not just McAfee data but any type a day
that's in the architecture secreting the

48
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,530
single pane glass

49
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,900
with real-time feeds enables us the Saab
some the problems

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,060
we were talking about earlier with these
attacks pretty powerful mechanism forced

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,540
to do it

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,569
here some the partners that we keep
seeing

53
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,620
will open up to almost any partner is
here to show

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,900
we've done so almost in every category
how do we offer a of indication

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,069
encryptions forensics every type of area
that can complement this threat data

56
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,690
to really open up all the threat feeds
that we have

57
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,780
all the dashboard reporting help solve
the problem again

58
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,360
these attacks are becoming very very
real time critical

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,670
and advanced creating an ecosystem for
us to take an event

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,580
after the network from a sim product
correlated to a policy

61
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,430
drive against a risk or remediated to
the enterprise

62
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,489
all measure and a very small window of
time is probably what's gonna save us

63
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,280
from the next attack or not how do we
how

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,040
build these architectures out together
again

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,760
I reach out the same way in walking this
architecture becomes a critical

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,650
component

67
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,900
what we're trying to do with the company
so I think about this is a framework at

68
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,180
least we're thinking through

69
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,259
intelligence in the cloud powerful as we
can

70
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,979
interlock through management to common
agent

71
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,850
and communicated through an entire
community

72
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,120
I mentioned at the very beginning kinda
what these numbers were looking like

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,860
anybody know what

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,130
these numbers here are probably some
other numbers that were

75
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,270
seeing right now live in our cloud-based
computing environment all those numbers

76
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,449
were in cryptid hasher's

77
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,470
these are small packets of content

78
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,110
just during the course of this
presentation we've now had 83 million

79
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,850
hits

80
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,150
or queries or content samples moving
back and forth to our cloud queries and

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,979
pains

82
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,090
going to the intelligence in the cloud

83
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,240
I never thought about 18 months ago we
would see a scenario

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,539
we receive four billion requests

85
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,139
in a single day for the back in
intelligent systems that's what we're

86
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,350
getting to that

87
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,500
four billion samples four billion pieces
of information

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,509
can be used to solve some of the
problems

89
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,470
very interesting world we're now living
in we're getting a huge numbers

90
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,860
and huge types I'm intelligent speeds
now to help solve the problems were seen

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,810
in the world

92
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,570
I think there's a lot I hope coming
there's a lot of opportunity for us all

93
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,100
to solve the problems that we see

94
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,610
we will see more these in the coming
days months and quarters

95
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,750
without a doubt I think the technology
is there to do it

96
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,930
I think we as a team can help solve so
with that I like to say thanks

97
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,199
I know everybody's been here a long time
appreciate everybody

98
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,690
we do have a great party tonight hope
y'all come to its called the McAfee red

99
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,550
party

100
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,380
to come to our booth not to be too
self-serving you can get a copy of the

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,419
imitation

102
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,139
but feel free to come we'd love to have
you we have a chance to talk some more

103
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,340
thanks very much appreciate it
