1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,200
thank you and good morning everyone like
to extend my own personal warm welcome

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,220
to all love you too

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,030
iris a conference 2010 know this
gathering

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,620
%uh hours gets more importantly each
year

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,340
because more than just the occasional
story

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,430
on the database preach the magnitude in
volume

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,490
up cyber vulnerabilities

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,039
and attacks have become mainstream
topics

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,770
in the media as never before
underscoring

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,300
the criticality the situation this week
you'll be hearing from

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,280
Secretary Napolitano FBI director molar

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,550
White House cybersecurity coordinator

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,219
Howard Schmidt and a host I've industry

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,440
and government leaders you know

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,840
it it really never gets easier for us
says

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,620
practitioners and then there's does it
malware

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,540
at pandemic levels a global economy

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,049
struggling to recover in a straitjacket
of cost controls

19
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,880
and a new wave of computing struggling
to take hold

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,390
cloud computing but it could get easier

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,909
how up by leveraging the technologies

22
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:28,240
enabling the clout to secure it sounds
heavenly

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
but as my father used to say p

24
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,640
everybody wants to go to heaven but
nobody wants to die

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,240
to get there and because cloud computing
represents a challenge

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,899
as well as an opportunity we have to be
careful

27
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,030
we don't end up in security hell so

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,470
whenever I feel locks ten by big
challenge like this

29
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,759
I like to look to history as a reminder
the boundless creativity of the human

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,350
mind

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,759
its ability to completely reimagined
aspects of life

32
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,960
that others seem unchangeable and we
don't need to look

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,819
any father then the recent past and the
man we honor this morning

34
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,090
with defeat as well as our own

35
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,290
Rs and a for this kind of creativity

36
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,530
in the area managing have crypt agassi

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,379
these are people who see what others
before them cannot

38
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,629
no matter how hard a look and from there
insight

39
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,349
they build a new vision sometimes

40
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,129
quite literally consider another

41
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,680
inspiring example imagine what it was
like

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,860
to be a blind person in the three
centuries

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,750
following looking birds invention the
printing press

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,440
the printing press represented a
sweeping transformation up the

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,849
information infrastructure on the time
it changed for ever the way thoughts

46
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,550
knowledge

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,110
and information was shared and yet

48
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,450
if you are blind you would have been
locked out this new world

49
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,750
recorded knowledge then

50
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,110
in the early eighteen hundreds along
comes Louis Braille

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,700
blind since the age up three

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,230
as a 16-year-old he envisioned and then
devised a system that would enable them

53
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,150
blind

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,150
to read as well as right his curiosity
led him to a form of communication

55
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,659
used by soldiers on the battlefield at
night

56
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,069
when they needed to send written
messages to each other

57
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,620
but didn't dare light a match

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,870
real adopted their grill %uh raised dots
but

59
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,390
dramatically improved and simplified

60
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,730
their system and that process till today

61
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,560
as one historian put it braille was

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
the gutenberg on the blind so

63
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,370
how does this relate to our industry

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,610
and our situation today

65
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,780
I believe we in the security industry

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,099
even what elevated an expansive vision

67
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,109
connected to the uge wave %uh IT
transformation that is

68
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,759
underway right now cloud computing

69
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,259
think for a moment about why cloud
computing is so powerful

70
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,030
in animals businesses to leave their AG
inflexible

71
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,020
and costly IT infrastructures behind and
moved to a new

72
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,169
Pay As You Go model characterized

73
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,650
by choice and agility

74
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,940
and not a moment too soon because

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,540
organizations are spending as much as
two-thirds of their

76
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,759
IT budgets just maintain their
infrastructures

77
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,990
and applications keeping the lights on

78
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,930
cloud computing can dramatically alter
this two-thirds one-third ratio

79
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,259
so that much more energy and investment
can be directed

80
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,960
toward real innovation and competitive
advantage

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,509
trouble is something's holding back

82
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,160
the full realization love this vision

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,009
and that in a word is security

84
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,050
CIO magazine recently published its
stated the CIO study

85
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,979
and get this fifty-one percent of CIOs
surveyed

86
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:36,039
more than half cited security as their
greatest concern

87
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,389
surrounding the adoption up cloud
computing

88
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,009
and if you are suffering from cloud for
T

89
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,100
alright tired of hearing about it let me
remind you

90
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,280
other than MIT Media Lab's visionary

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,710
Nicolas Negra Ponting who said in 1997

92
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,020
that the internet was the most
over-hyped

93
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,509
but underestimated phenomenon in history

94
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,949
mark my words the same will be true up
cloud computing

95
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,270
cloud computing will complete the
transformation a

96
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,169
IT infrastructures unleashed by the
Internet

97
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,340
organizations will demand it because
they must

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,509
absolutely must get faster and better
returns

99
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,780
on their IT investments so we must play

100
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,610
an essential role in making cloud
computing

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,830
a reality so here's the skull

102
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,990
about challenge an hour opportunity

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,860
as I see it the challenge is to ensure
that safety is designed

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,610
and built into the cloud so that
organizations a every size

105
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,690
from the smallest merchant are agency to
the largest

106
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,139
government or multinational can make
broad use in the cloud

107
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,400
fully confident that their information
and transactions

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,940
are secure are industry

109
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,270
needs to deliver security solutions that
ensure

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,870
levels of protection in the cloud that
surpass

111
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,530
what physical environments offer today

112
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,590
in short people must everywhere be able
to trust the clout

113
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,330
even if they literally and
metaphorically

114
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,870
can't see thats

115
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,449
our challenge what about our opportunity

116
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,470
the answer is that cloud computing

117
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,490
is going to make your work more
important and prominent

118
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,750
then ever before cloud computing is our
opportunity

119
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,210
did to change the way we deliver
security

120
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,310
inside out I say that

121
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,960
because the cloud will force
organizations to pay serious attention

122
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,470
to this security management process ease

123
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:05,750
not just their endpoint dead endpoint
security technologies

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,740
we have for rare opportunity for do of

125
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,060
to be present at the creation n roll out

126
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,470
on this new wave of computing with
security

127
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,030
built in from the get-go

128
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,020
we can't be on the ground floor to
create and infrastructure

129
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,289
that is actually more secure and more
enabling

130
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,719
%uh innovation then today's physical
infrastructures

131
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,769
that's my focus today how together

132
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,349
we can make the cloud inherently secure

133
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,800
compliance and governed in a way in a
way and manner that ensures

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,810
confidentiality

135
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,019
integrity and availability about
information

136
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,420
in other words security that enables
business

137
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,450
like never before

138
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,600
so where we start in the world of cloud
computing will need to enforce

139
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,830
all the same identity information
infrastructure policies

140
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,560
we have in the physical world but it
gets trickier

141
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,600
because ritual infrastructures decouple

142
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,070
your software environment from the
underlying hardware

143
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,140
infrastructure so that you can aggregate
many servers

144
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,839
storage systems and networks into shared
pools and resources

145
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
as we consider how to make the clouds
safe I think it's best to begin with

146
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,820
people

147
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,870
process and technology just as we do

148
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,700
in other aspects a business and security

149
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,610
so let's start with the people shelling
in the physical world

150
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,790
all these are siloed separate groups
focus on

151
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,830
storage servers networks and points and
so on

152
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,730
in the cloud many of these operations in
roles

153
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,790
will converge for example

154
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,040
world
