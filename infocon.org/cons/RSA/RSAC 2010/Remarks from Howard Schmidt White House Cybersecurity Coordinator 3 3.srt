1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,830
so today I'm I'm pleased to announce
that the administration has updated the

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,410
classification guidance for the
comprehensive national cybersecurity

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,550
initiative or CNC I

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,870
which began in 2008 in forms an
important component of our cybersecurity

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,770
efforts within the federal government as
a noontime today

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,539
in about 50 minutes you'll be able to go
to white house not go

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,220
slash cybersecurity and download the
unclassified description

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,720
up the CNC I and each are the twelve

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,720
initiatives under the CNC I hedging
transparency in partnership for concepts

10
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,570
that have to go on hand in hand

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,610
we can ask industry to help the
government the government can offer to

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,410
help industry

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,239
must we have a transparency so we
believe this is particularly important

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,110
in areas

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,739
such the C&C I would have been
legitimate questions about sensitive

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,820
topics in the role the intelligence
community in cybersecurity

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,119
and how they can help us while still
preserving privacy and civil liberties

18
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,350
it gives the american people in
particular the ability to partner with

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,150
the government and participate
meaningfully

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,310
in a discussion about action already
extraordinary response s

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,159
and expertise and the other communities
to bring to that and the protection in

22
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,890
oversight

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,360
of civil liberties and privacy in order
to be successful yesterday cybersecurity

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,880
threats

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,579
we must continue to seek out new and
innovative partnerships

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,900
not only within the government working
hard at that but also months industry

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,030
government and academia and more
importantly

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,150
the public at large has to be part of
this so our collective knowledge

29
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,229
and our experience are probably the most
powerful tool that we have

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,520
we were not we're not gonna wind up
beating our adversaries because they're

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,040
weak

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,649
we know that they're strong they're
getting stronger we'll beat them because

33
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,070
we will become stronger

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,979
will develop stronger technology train
and equip a better cadre of security

35
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,920
professionals

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,640
understand this issue to become our
critical assets

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,119
and become more resilient cyber security
is a shared responsibility for all of us

38
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,590
we must all partner together to make
sure cybersecurity

39
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,800
to secure we can only do what we can do
to secure

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,520
our part cyberspace and that's what
we're asking or view detail

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,290
once again thank you very much for being
here wish you the best

42
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,590
week for the rest the cop to look for
December 18 of thank you very much
