1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,379
management authentication

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,560
Federation is a is a big aspect that

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,990
I'm transaction security we're a lot
about that as well

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,059
and you point out in crib in India with
crypto on was transaction so I i so I

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,470
guess

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,150
I'm ask Kurt this one make like some
people

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,250
believe that the security services are
just gonna be you

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,289
like coming later but you have services
today

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,650
are you you're doing security services
for your customers in the cloud today I

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,329
his eyes understand and the security
services like they're gonna be success

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,020
for the one hundred

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,230
easy to use right and their effective
asked a lot of times you know

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,360
securities always group that country and
they say yes will help with that

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,989
yet person they say if you in bed that

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,039
to wear things I love that I computing
is all the things he has mentioned I am

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,670
and a

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,800
but also it's the on managing editor
assets

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,149
and the applications so ASI this earlier
said

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,989
do you know all the assets in your clout
you know everything there because you

20
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:00,750
charge for all that

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,859
they'll raise your hand if you know
every asset allocation

22
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,710
and person running on your network yeah
it's a hard thing to do

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,200
right so with that knowledge it where
all the assets are

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,220
have the identity you know the
applications are the ability to

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,790
integrate security in there is a lot
easier

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,229
Righton let's play cuz I i kno in my
past life in

27
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,400
roles II you see the email come from a
department within

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,180
URL link for all the employees to go
click on create a username and password

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,320
and got a new service right without any
thought to

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,189
identity or when tax management or
anything like that is following the most

31
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,140
frustrating thing and all built off and
I would wrestle with and

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,430
in my old days but I think that people
are now starting to see that you're

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,710
creating always ball ability points and
having to manage it much more

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,850
effectively now

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,159
out but Kurt Geiger I added to your
senator

36
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,780
unbelievably amazing places just opened
this past year

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,950
I am obvious you probably do some top
secret things you can share and talk

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,590
about we understand that we'd love to
hear that the bar later by

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,460
HIPAA take and might be there too so i i

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,890
I you you guys are a cloud

41
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,940
consumer and provider you do both things
I

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,920
maybe expand a little bit on that and
share how you do some %uh those things

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,390
and why the way to both

44
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,489
well like is a fairly good size company
paper

45
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,540
have 140,000 boys and

46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,860
in R&D group we just for we want to move
faster

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,390
and but also the security in that it so
we started building around here

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,099
with our partners with like see in-store
other partners in the scene here

49
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,430
build your own secure clout min betting
a lot of the security that you know the

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,500
compliance issues

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,430
on anything ever standards our customers
have by betting that in

52
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,690
increases Julia Varady teams mmm you
know didn't happen wait five

53
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,879
you know top 25 people to get something
30 seconds later you got what you wanted

54
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,069
and it was set up

55
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,040
in a fine fashion the way that our
customer needs it to your research work

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,610
around that

57
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,700
so as a consumer right we start using
that and from our customers

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,190
their German heavily by lowering costs
more for the solutions

59
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,310
vs be secure but they want to get those
applications out

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,440
that they need to get their mission done
faster which is a big reason why we

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,120
focused now on bring those back in those
for customers

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,959
right to the law is unlocked in virtual
environments and VM's you're creating

63
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,030
is is that is that the quarter that or
is it also

64
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,330
are leveraging other applications from
other providers

65
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,019
so depending what the mission as it
could be a massive multiple applications

66
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,739
from the clout right but also you for a
lot of that like private housing public

67
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,530
outburst elections a key component but
that's only a

68
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,220
a start nothing how the automation and
that in the security things in

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,860
components and there's the actual be
proactive versus reactive okay

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,200
so Steve wood Tom cloud services do you
think consumers will leverage the most

71
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,250
all of them Iban hacer even mad

72
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,040
only a softball yeah album

73
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,840
I'll we started out as Tom

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,659
E with that the simple storage service
that was the one that was

75
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,159
merely the beginning a the Amazon Cloud
and

76
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,810
began to dispel a bit of a myth Amazon
Web Services is not excess capacity from

77
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,799
Amazon to call

78
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,669
are amazon dot com has been around for a
very long time

79
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,240
and what what we did was took the
learnings from

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,270
building something that was essentially
100% sent reliable and created this

81
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,320
service started about four years ago

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,940
and then just your slowly start to add

83
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,940
got essentially primitive as you might
think of them write a queueing service

84
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,540
a compute service added to database
service on top of their so

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,400
what we want to be really good at
providing

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,669
that utility computing infrastructures
so that maybe someday

87
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,020
right next to the electrical outlet in
your wallet and Ethernet outlet in your

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
wall

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,880
arm and John you know your you get
compute and storage

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,100
just the way you get electricity it but

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,680
you know at this point even though
there's plenty of room in the cloud

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,479
industry for

93
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,690
plenty of players there's some
attractiveness to us as we

94
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,750
we move up the back with their the
relational database service

95
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,460
which as you know pre-configured my
sequel now you don't worry about the

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,580
instances and things like that

97
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,500
will we get into being an identity
provider

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,210
can't say I I don't know arm you know i
i

99
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,840
you be i think is good to focus on on
the core skills that you want to really

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,020
excel at

101
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,250
and and become the provider of choice
for that

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,770
while at the same time allowing enormous
ecosystem to grow on top of that which

103
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,220
is

104
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,300
something that that that are kinda proud
we're done with our

105
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,160
ISBN S II program you guys should be got
a fantastic service you guys are

106
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,110
operating

107
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,070
attempt to any comments on that light on
what you think consumers will

108
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,600
gravitate more quickly to donna three
security but the different services in

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,520
the cloud

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,000
I think the I'm the making consumers
will be folks

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,750
with is MIT what personal what am I
getting

112
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,330
4 a.m. I getting more privacy for it to
make any more security foreign

113
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,569
on and I'm does it does it help
facilitate what I'm trying to do so I

114
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,210
think

115
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,880
that the verification and you should
think about identity it's not just the

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,259
username and password there so many
things that cock constitute

117
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,660
and individuals identity and in that
that the new waters were going into you

118
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,300
makes psyche is such an critical role to
have what on

119
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,990
a lot of people call and identity
authority so it's one thing to say

120
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,490
here's de beers him that's great but you
need that

121
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,680
herbert third party to say yes that's
true

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,440
let the transaction go on so I I think
the authentication and verification or

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,330
probably the first ones are gone ahead
and also on compliance services

124
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,690
help me navigate these waters to make
sure as I migrate to the cloud

125
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,770
the timing compliance will vote services
that'll help people

126
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,020
migrate to the cloud and and help adopt
their

127
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,199
are you guys any scene those papers
services become available because I

128
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,880
think

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,490
it's a complex model if you look at how
many different service offering you have

130
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,080
within your IT apartment

131
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,610
and then kinda shopping them around on
do you see a market for being able to

132
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,710
support that migration and

133
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,919
help in that translation to a cloud
service her I've seen at both actually

134
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,310
seen some process a look we Alice legacy
stuff you know just to the cloud came

135
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,250
right now doesn't mean by mainframes or
Amy's and all those that actually ever

136
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,759
went away this up interfere with in some
ways passion

137
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,360
but then seen a whole different
mentalities has

138
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,620
let's start fresh for builders
applications in the cloud

139
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,280
and that over time we're gonna my great
things over because people are gonna

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,400
want to do it

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,830
not because we're forcing him on there
and iteration because because this time

142
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,190
we're gonna

143
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,099
right right United this a buddy of mine

144
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,970
at Amazon he and IR trying to put
together a body of knowledge that we

145
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,460
call

146
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,940
think clout 'em and

147
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,699
as much as we'd love to see kinda push
button migration right here's my

148
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,470
legacy ap right I now wanted to run over
here

149
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,550
um I I don't think it's going to be

150
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,970
that easy I and I just give you at one
quick example

151
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,870
in a traditional data center approach to
thinking about things it's the server is

152
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,039
what matters the server is this precious
piece of crystal that we will do

153
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,229
everything we can

154
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,910
to make sure that is constantly runs and
you know babysit 9

155
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,910
were the right temperature in the right
food and everything

156
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,949
in the cloud servers are disposable
horsepower yeah

157
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,950
you know they come and they go arm and

158
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,380
there's there's a certain body of
knowledge about how to

159
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,310
architect for failure and that takes
advantage

160
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,320
have some other the resiliency built
into things like

161
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,610
automatic data replication multiple data
centers and things like that

162
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,380
and you might not be accustomed to doing
now are and

163
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,180
not all applications are going to
immediately translate over

164
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,209
into something like that I'm and

165
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:01,390
and some part of what at least some up
what I'm trying to do n

166
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,220
and some others in my group is is
produced

167
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,620
upset about our communication to help
people learn how to think this way

168
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,920
you how do you build an application so
that if something fails

169
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,330
the business doesn't fail as a result of
that right and I

170
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,630
it gave I also think you're gonna see
more about on you

171
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,660
individual consumer base is more than
opt in

172
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,250
typeof model emerging this because

173
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,519
I'm you there's things are our team in
motion that will help you carry your

174
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,339
identity

175
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,830
cross-domain Cross website as opposed to
now the very siloed

176
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,660
the way the the internets its structure
today I think you'll see that as well

177
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,790
right Solaria gotta lotta good important

wanna be a panel here I would engage you
to do another survey

179
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,080
on Cloud Security I eighty you learned
today that you want to add or delete

180
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,170
from

181
