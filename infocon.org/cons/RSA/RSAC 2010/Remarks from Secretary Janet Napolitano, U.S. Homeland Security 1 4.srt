1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,860
it is %ah great to be here on this

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,940
very important topic I

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,719
something that in my first year as the
central Homeland Security we have

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,460
I spent quite a bit of time thinking
about

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,279
organizing I strategizing

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,359
a evaluating out where we stand as a
country and where we need need to be

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,820
I and all that thinking and strategizing
is

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,689
is very nice but what that doesn't
communique

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,010
is the sense of urgency in SPIE

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,430
with which our nation needs to to work
and need to act in

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,480
I was on a plane just a few days ago

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,059
with by nephew he is 15

13
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,200
and and he pulled out a

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,120
a book to read in the plane and I
believe it was call hacking

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,180
the archive exploitation I

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,420
something you have read that book I

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,250
and a this morning in my clips

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,619
and I was there reported the arrest
yesterday at three in the ringleaders

19
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,549
I love the Mariposa botnet issue with
Shia

20
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,810
a affected something like thirteen
million

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,159
PCs and I you recognize

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,640
a that this is

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,920
a the future I both from a security
standpoint

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,430
but also from an economic standpoint for
every stamp point you can possibly

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,630
imagine so a

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,270
this is an area where the Department of
Homeland Security actually stands

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,720
at a very important juncture I within
the whole federal

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,990
a system within all federal government
so what I'd like to do with you today is

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,439
talk a little bit about where we are
seated

30
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,530
where things are what a

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,780
above the actions and priorities are

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,780
I and then a I

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,009
announce a a a little bit about
competition

34
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,750
that I hope you all love you will be
willing to participate in

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,379
now I i know nothing about the the
conference

36
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,450
this year is the Rosetta Stone

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,090
I and that is a pretty good metaphor

38
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,599
other rosetta stone of course helped I
asked to decipher a complex

39
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,290
riddle out how to rejection how are the
pics are but it also lead to a better

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,750
understanding a different culture
different people

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,060
and the cyber challenges we

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,420
confront today I are every bit as much
about

43
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,739
I'm culture and people and away as about
technology

44
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,150
so I could emphasize anything it's this

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,430
that DHS we understand these challenges

46
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,480
I think we are building one of the best
teams

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,580
anywhere to tackle them are but that our
success will depend in no small part

48
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,940
are on our ability to intersect
effectively and efficiently

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,970
with the private sector now I

50
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,599
we have been working collaboratively
it's been

51
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,860
very nice on but again

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,890
a sense of urgency needs to be increased

53
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,269
so let me outline some other specific
ways

54
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,250
other we can be working at together up
first

55
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,540
a it's important to note a new at Howard
Schmidt here yesterday

56
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,849
you're going to have director more the
FBI tomorrow

57
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,900
about the president himself has

58
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,909
described our networks and the hardware
that supports them

59
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,590
as strategic national assets and he is
called the growing number of attacks on

60
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,010
these

61
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,540
networks what are the most serious
economic and national security threats

62
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,010
our nation faces so

63
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,930
well we need to work with the private
sector but also throughout the federal

64
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,519
government on some of those

65
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,810
related issues we work with the FBI on
cyber investigations and cyber

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,689
challenges

67
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:18,400
in in at least two specific ways our
first

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,070
a the elect tronic Crimes Task Force
which is housed

69
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,380
at the secret service and Sackett

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,800
a the Immigration and Customs
Enforcement

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,020
ice has within at the national
intellectual property rights

72
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,370
Center I'm so the first

73
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,840
a connection throughout the federal
government is on the pier law

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,850
enforcement side the second

75
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,270
is on the economic crimes protection I P
aside

76
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,729
I that work again will only be
increasing

77
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,720
and it will increase based on the
template that was laid out

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,169
in a president cyber review last spring

79
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,729
I where there was a comprehensive
examination aware cyber at this huge

80
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,960
mass we call the federal government

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,229
how is it organize who should have the
lead

82
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,889
and the like and so the president cyber
review concluded that the Department of

83
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,080
Defense

84
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
I will a retain only

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,370
up for the the military the dot mil

86
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,940
and national security systems are but
that the Department of Homeland Security

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,389
will have the lead for other civilian
side of government the dot gov

88
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:37,110
domains I as well as the lead to work
with industry with the private sector

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,870
ought to help defend privately owned and
operated

90
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,509
networks particularly as they up fact

91
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,550
critical infrastructure now these are
huge responsibilities for what in

92
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,340
reality

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,580
is a young Department the youngest
Department in

94
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,449
the federal family %uh but these are the
challenges that we want and that we

95
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,610
accept

96
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,729
I we r for example

97
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,870
well working I with our a

98
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,900
a private sector partners in the
financial services

99
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,990
arena and with other key industries
about what needs to be done and what can

100
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,949
be done

101
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,750
to strengthen security out there that
engagement

102
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,590
we will continue and build upon over the
months and years to come

103
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,360
years to come up but I think before

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,600
going much further I'd like to put it in
a little bit of a context for you

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,770
because the Department of Homeland
Security

106
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,120
was founded in the wake of the attacks a
911

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,460
I and terrorism in the fight against

108
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,650
terrorism a remains up

109
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,020
really our core principle that's what we
were set up to do

110
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,110
but as the threats against the nation

111
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,349
have evolved since 9 11 a

112
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,169
the department itself past two evolve we
can't be

113
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,789
static because you don't live in a
static world

114
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,330
so we have to evolved to secure the
aviation system

115
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,710
to protect the borders and the ports %uh

116
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,050
to enforce and facilitate the
immigration

117
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,340
loss not to make our country more

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,520
ready and resilient for disasters

119
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,020
a from whatever source and the course
the attention paid to cyber to

120
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,680
cybersecurity

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,110
I particularly that which threatens our
cyber infrastructure

122
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,690
are also threats then to our homeland
security

123
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,099
so this year one other one of the tasks
we

124
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,620
under two I west to do are basically a
long-range

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,729
vision for this department by the way

126
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,210
it may be the youngest but is now the
third largest department

127
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,419
the federal government that's a huge
enterprise that

128
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,610
is located not just domestically but
across the globe

129
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,509
about it it did not have a yet a kind of
a long range where are we going

130
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,340
what is the vision for the Department of
Homeland Security so we conducted

131
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,840
I a quadrennial Homeland Security review
the first-ever

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,569
cue age s are are which provides an
overarching framework for the department

133
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,990
the fines are key priorities and goals
and outlines a strategy for achieving

134
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,410
them

135
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,820
I am because of the clear mission that
DHS now has in the cyber

136
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,050
realm as a result a the president's
review

137
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,940
are what are the top five we listed five

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
priorities for this huge department
where we're going to focus on

139
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,120
5 areas and what have those

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,290
5 areas is safeguarding and securing
cyberspace

141
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,589
the first time any federal quadrennial
review has specifically identified

142
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,370
cyberspace as a major mission area

143
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,610
and within that major mission area we
have to

144
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,620
goals to help create a say secure and
resilient cyber environment

145
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,740
and to promote cyber security knowledge

146
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,860
and innovation so I

147
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,529
now now that we've identified this is
something

148
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,040
a space in which we will be very very
active

149
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,130
I we began then by coordinating and
consolidating

150
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,160
the department's cyber efforts under the

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,320
leadership love our deputy
undersecretary feel right ger

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,839
now bill is moving aggressively to build
I think wanna

153
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,570
the best cyber security teams anywhere

154
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,250
are both with talent from with in the
federal government

155
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,149
but also with new authority to hire top
professionals from the private sector

156
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:53,870
from

157
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,339
outside the government arm

158
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,990
in fact a we may be trying to read
