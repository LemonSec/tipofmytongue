1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,020
security conscious choices are safety
conscious choices decision

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,730
guys a bit but online it seems like

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,849
we don't have those same kinds of
signals

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:14,769
so how how can how can somebody help any
user

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,900
Craigslist make better decisions

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,900
are and the people that they kinda been
gauge where

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,070
then 'em yeah game since had a change

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,560
well it seems the happen in reality is
that people in general

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,070
get increasingly smart about something
the tone of a message

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,410
I mean for people will fall for anything

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,870
but the vast majority of people gets are
smart and getting smarter and all that

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,420
I can tell there cuz I have
conversations with early every day with

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,100
people

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,090
they smell something bad and then they
can figure it out

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,789
this applies to all of us though we all
get fish to times or whatever

16
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,079
army I think I mentioned before that

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,039
for years that he's a very fancy mailed
to all which helps prevent security

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,110
problems

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,970
this advanced will call pine I

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,340
about a month ago back too good
policeman

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,630
have it let me hook you up with the
executed well after this I

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,890
and some graphics and planner well about
a month ago we switched to

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,189
a new advanced 20 I'll pie in the only
change I found

24
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,570
is that it'll tell you are what link

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,640
you're really being directed to when
you're looking at some HTML

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,060
and you know it occurs to me that if all
the big webmail providers like Gmail

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,210
if they threw in a little JavaScript
which told you when the link

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,500
look different than the actual place
you're being sent to

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,970
if you got a little JavaScript popup
which said hey this is what it seems

30
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,579
that might help with a lot of fishing or
do I know I've been coated in 10 years

31
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,320
so with let me ask you this I mean

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,960
that jam a script that you're talking
about that might provide visibility to

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,790
the user but the user still alternately
has to make a choice right

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,259
okay can solak anything accept or not
accept

35
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,110
and at least in my experience in hand
this is based on watching My Mom

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,480
buy stuff at and and she will also
always take the path of least resistance

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,930
if she thinks okay we'll get her to
purchase that item

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,069
she's gonna click OK if she thinks
something that comes up in Russian

39
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,959
letters will get her that I

40
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,680
chill click whatever's out there for her
to fulfill some kinda mention

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,970
well you're right people

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,370
you know the weather's bad guys are
getting smarter people ordinary

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,420
consumers are getting smarter as well

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,750
sometimes the most you can do is let
people know what goes on

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,099
that's one of the reasons Obama involves
Consumer Reports

46
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,000
up it's one of the reasons I was at a
meeting in Washington not long ago

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,810
where i'm saying if you wanna Pete let
people know what's going on

48
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,120
get posters like the old are loose lips
sink ships posters

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
okay and a kiss if you're a a troop
posting on Facebook

50
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,040
don't tell people where are you are for
that matter if you're a

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,170
State Department diplomat overseas don't
tell people what hotel you're staying at

52
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,280
I so this this ties into Secretary
Napolitano is an answering yesterday as

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,720
a new cyber awareness campaign

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,760
and a you know I I think that make sense
it says something and I i wanted to ask

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,450
you bad too so September am kinda

56
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,709
crews in the bookstore man and I see the
cover up Wired Magazine

57
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,159
and I think we have a shot have it here
the tragedy

58
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,599
up Craigslist ran any reaction

59
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,000
well actually there are being a little
tongue in cheek

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,330
the tragedy is that we listen to people
in our community

61
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,519
and we respond to that the untold story
behind the cover is that %uh the

62
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,170
previous month was Brad Pitt

63
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,750
I they are logical

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,260
yellowing they decide whether they
really need to sell more magazines

65
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,780
so they brought in the ATM I

66
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,590
now the the downside is Angelina for
that

67
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,280
and began making enquiries about me all
man

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,030
and the their breakup may have been

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,520
caused by that up

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,020
fortunately I my girlfriend disorder her
control

71
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,419
and I think Brad and Angelina are back
together again

72
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,900
maisha a happy ending to this story man

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,940
I don't think you wanna get in that Brad
and Angelina

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,790
kinda trying on very dangerous she may
still be waiting though

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,130
but no cut like there's something to be
said here about a man in the middle

76
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,280
attack I don't know why

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,940
yeah a

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,460
hair on that note

79
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,650
I would like to welcome another gas

80
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,840
to add to this conversation at now this
guy has very interesting perspective

81
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,490
is somebody that understands technology
has built some the fundamental

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,039
technology that we still use today

83
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,630
or at least initial fabrica at but he
also understands how technology

84
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,300
breaks and again this guy needs no
introduction

85
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,539
and I call on a technology

86
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:40,539
Steve Wozniak

87
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,720
good has gone

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
difficult shares pray

89

how horrible to be here with you you
have a you have a lift

90
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,470
and they I have a list to but I think
might get by the FBI

91
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,420
I know following questions asked other

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,060

98
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,780
right to hear saw what happened and
truly efficient yeah

99
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,200
and I i a wondrous like that in the
press was it was one other

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,290
early cars that was had the most in the
electronics

101
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,070
they were doing so much with electronics
in the central console and all that

102
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,800
stuff from

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,660
so it's I mean that its enough either
nine princes

104
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,780
since 2009 and I'll up in all have more
and I'll have more about your trash the

105
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,770

assistant my sister my kids my a white

106
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,100
myself we use 'em all the just love them
now I show my story

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,200
it was done with you you're talking
about to

108
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,740
cruise control and how the work and in
the pre S and what I found really

109
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,470
interesting about that

110
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,320
is obviously a complex system at a lot
of electronics lot of things working

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,130
together

112
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,900
can you talk a little bit about your
experience I can talk a little bit about

113
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,700
which is

114
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,670
I tested over and over a situation where
I would bump the cruise control up and

115
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,200
watch must be got my own our

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,110
I was trying to see if it would go up to
miles an hour sometimes 0 other times

117
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,190
I got one mile an hour to 71 72 73 in

118
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,430
settle 74 or some number not gonna say

119
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,150
haha K at the iron ore not more of a
sudden

120
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,610
solar torn keep going keep going and the
highway was totally

121
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,310
clear the first time I did it was it
does and it was totally clear from me so

122
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,010
i just want to see

123
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,720
how high is it time to go and it seemed
to be unlimited so I climb lead at the

124
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,280
break

125
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,870
to turn off the cruise control system no
problem so I didn't think it was a

126
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,950
dangerous thing that was many many
months ago

127
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,460
at but a boy I had trouble getting
anybody super interested in this whole

128
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,160
thing when the things come down on
Toyota Parts elevators stick em

129
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,730
why didn't anybody wasn't me but my
problem is my problem had to be in

130
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,670
of work or maybe a switch got stuck
wanna fight quick the cruise control up

131
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,290
in the switch

132
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,410
acts like it still on you know and I'm
sure the black box or whatever minimal

133
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,500
black box they have in the car would
tell these are things

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,560
but we'll work on computers know that
there are a lotta little failures

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,710
gadgets all the time some gadget will

136
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,890
just freeze stopped working in some way
turn it off

137
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,700
turned on at work since the standard
procedure computers big gaps in small

138
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,370
gadgets

139
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,470
and I've had that spring to mind
increases before two

140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,190
where were like might make some real
stop playin sound and the other some

141
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,090
force will play

142
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,430
why did shut off of stopped the car pull
over at the next exit

143
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,630
sperm the car of turned on and now it
works

144
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,530
just others like any just like
everything we have another call or a

145
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,530
blessed the trouble I don't like to say

146
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,070
and I've had the same thing happens the
GPS and no GPS on about the desert

147
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,510
and then I'll pull over after 20 minutes
pullover and the car off turn it on and

148
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,470
it works perfectly

149
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,250
and just like all the other gadgets we
have but it's a bigger gadgets a car

150
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,740
and the thing as um everything you have
been like you know where I see somebody

151
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,380
have some

152
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,830
what's going on about work both I said
everything today has a computer in it so

153
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,980
everything will fail

154
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,080
should kill the guys who invented these
things a

155
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,450
okay and in the case and once I'm sorry
I'll that now

156
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,350
but do on let me asking me: so much

157
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,590
more and more of our lives are depending
on the software systems and you're right

158
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,790
we have gotten into its cold out like
that boudin restart

159
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,240
Mike there are some stuff that's not
going to work with and we made this

160
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,720
processor so inexpensive

161
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,850
you hear about cars that have you know
maybe five BB maybe nine maybe 200

162
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,700
processors in a

163
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,700
the all talking to each other and boy a
system like that a real time system is

164
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,020
very difficult to analyze to debug you
anybody has ever developed

165
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,390
certain kinds of a hard we'll have a
problem you just can't find you going

166
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,130
all night long

167
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,850
and you make and gas and something seems
to fix it at without working

168
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,130
and the next day we come back and it
fails again you know it's hard for

169
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,850
sometimes

170
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,940
incredibly difficult to track down these
nonlinear systems

171
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,930
and one from glitch you know throws
