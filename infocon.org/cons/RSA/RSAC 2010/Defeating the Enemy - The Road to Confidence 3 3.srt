1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,760
announcing a breakthrough technology
that we call data insight

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,850
what it does is it brings together

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,410
the capabilities we have a knowledge a
file systems and knowledge of security

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,330
to solve all the problems that plagues
everybody who manages information

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,640
and Matt is data ownership if you can
secure information

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,670
you ultimately have to know who owned it
Rd OP technology will be integrated

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,650
with the data inside capabilities and
will do is three primary things

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,820
it will automatically determine data
ownership

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,809
by keeping track who's using it the
second thing is it ok scanned file

10
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:36,510
shares

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,800
and I'll determine what file shares are
exposed

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,219
to everyone because those are the file
shares that are targeted both by

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,530
malicious insiders

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,539
and external attackers and also monitor

15
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,760
who is accessing and modifying what
files because with that allow you to do

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,190
is very quickly determine if an employee
is suddenly has an unusual usage pattern

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,079
data back on Warner security team an
alert them

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,280
to potentially a breach in security
dating site

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,390
will work and reside days that will work
independent where the information

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,350
resides

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,430
whether it be on-premise or off-premise
and this'll help you

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,380
to have a better data governance model
the third topic

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,680
is it's important for us to think about
how do we have the same

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,450
visibility into security posture %uh of
from the solutions as we do on premise

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,100
last december we created a partnership
with Amazon dot com

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,610
and their web services group to extend
their

27
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,210
ec2 cloud platform and allow us to bring
security and cloud services together so

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,320
what I've done is a vast

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,360
verner vocals the city of Venice on dot
com

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,530
to share his perspective what we're
doing thank you re re K

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,149
I appreciate the opportunity for being
part of your keynote today

32
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,520
I V gripped that I cannot be there in
person

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,750
cloud computing is changing the way I T
is being delivered

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,300
he moved most of the heavy lifting that
every IT department has to do

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,430
by managing skate ability reliability

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,020
performance and security of their IT
infrastructure

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,200
clout improved to cost efficiency for
the elimination of capital investments

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,470
and by reducing operational cost IT
organizations

39
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,790
that move to the cloud also side
increased agility

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,750
and flexibility as major benefits
greatly improving get time to market

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,930
over the past four years

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,310
I was on Web Services has provided
companies of all sizes

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,950
if any infrastructure Web Services
Platform mean the clout

44
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,330
Avery s is built on the same global
computing infrastructure

45
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,590
that is the backbone of Amazon book
combs retail business

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,980
and transactional enterprise the means
that you get the benefit of the

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,390
Operational Excellence

48
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,950
that I was on this developed and
improved upon for over 15 years wording

49
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,040
I was on the outcome

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,599
I've been visiting with many IT decision
makers and I know that

51
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,340
just like for us at Amazon operational
excellence and security

52
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,890
a very important to you it is a top
priority for you to make sure your

53
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,340
business can leverage cloud-based
environments

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,080
in a secure and well-managed manner and
prefer a body in a way

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,930
that the significant investments that
you have already made in this area

56
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,489
can be leveraged which is why we are so
excited about the partnership for

57
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,250
semantic

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,810
semantic on the stance that the security
on the street

59
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,319
must evolve as cloud computing changes
the IT landscape

60
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,500
in particular semantic understands the
importance of information security

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,750
reliability and privacy in cloud
environments

62
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,549
we're very pleased that amount because
offering their security and storage

63
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,069
management solutions

64
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,970
on Amazon ec2 ensuring that customers
have to write level of protection

65
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,830
and are able to manage their story
generated gives them confidence

66
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,650
in their information while using
cloud-based services

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,739
thank you again for asking me to join
you here today

68
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,359
we're excited about working with
semantic and wish you all

69
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,889
great success in the clout

70
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:25,430
says Berger says semantic in Amazon have
a common vision

71
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,720
what we need to do to protect

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
the Internet and protect the cloud
services ultimately the same security

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,199
that you use on-premise

74
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,910
you want to use in the cloud and so
that's what we're delivering together

75
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,199
but thats an important step and it's a
step in the right direction but we as an

76
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,120
industry

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,620
and its cloud service providers need to
do a lot more

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,210
we need to do is think about how do we
manage system configurations

79
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,790
access controls vulnerability scans and
retention policies

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,550
because their commitments there being
made to all of us but how do we know

81
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,180
but those are actually being mad so as
an industry we need to come together and

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,080
create a set of standards

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,690
that will allow us to more efficiently
have disability

84
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,990
into the infrastructures that we're
taking advantage of standards like

85
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,120
ascap will give us a vocabulary that we
can use

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,410
to talk about vulnerability assessments
configuration data

87
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,340
and are we getting updates and patches
deployed as we should

88
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,340
putting these controls in place is
another step in the right direction

89
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,120
thinking longer-term working with the
National Institute of Standards and

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,039
Technology

91
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,440
and the Cloud Security Alliance to
define a set a standard that we think

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,910
will make a further step to bringing
higher visibility

93
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,060
into the infrastructure everybody
delivering cloud-based services to up to

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,930
all of us

95
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,970
lastly I want to talk about this notion
0

96
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,340
taking advantage of today's cloud-based
security services

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,259
by taking advantage of the services you
can reduce complexity in your

98
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:52,900
environment

99
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,650
you can focus on the core competencies
of your business and not be dependent on

100
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,460
putting up

101
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,169
infrastructure in your environment where
you can allow third-party do so

102
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,259
this is something that we know very well
today semantic has over 17 million

103
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,430
customers were using our online backup

104
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,090
and security services worldwide if you
think about it though what we have to do

105
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,110
is bring together

106
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,160
interoperability between on-premise and
cloud-based solutions

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,850
so for example if one of our customers
is using our DLP solution

108
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,620
and they're also using a hosted email
security service any doppler

109
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,699
interoperate because what becomes
important is the ability

110
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,160
to block sensitive information from
leaving your environment whether that's

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,539
done through an on-premise email system

112
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,069
or of prime system the deal P technology
and the cloud-based delivered

113
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,500
email services need to work together

114
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,930
it's important that the same security
use today on-premise

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,340
extend out into the cloud and this is a
clear

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,460
example a white interoperability has to
exist

117
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,449
cloud computing digital devices our
exciting new trends

118
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,150
their driving our industry forward to
propelling the evolution

119
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,970
at the information economy what we know
is information

120
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,770
will live in many places it'll be
accessed from more places than ever

121
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,319
before

122
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,630
and we also know that that same
information what absolutely be targeted

123
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,750
above all else we know information will
be

124
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,479
our greatest asset recently I was
speaking to a very large company who

125
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,139
told me

126
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,240
1 percent up their total data

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,949
is what really matters and that's what's
going to get targeted

128
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,690
so security is not about placing higher
walls around our information

129
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,150
or locking down a device it's about
enabling

130
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,830
our businesses to take advantage in
these emerging technologies

131
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,069
to receive the benefits %uh these new
trends

132
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,259
it's not about picking a computing model
or no es

133
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,479
or device are trying to figure out who's
gonna win

134
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
it's about thinking about how do we
secure and manage diverse environments

135
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,220
because

136
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,340
all our environment will continue to
become

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,979
more diverse none of us can say exactly

138
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,330
what the next decade will bring but what
we know

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,960
is to be more connectivity to be more
access to information that will bring

140
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,349
greater productivity more collaboration
and better ideas

141
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,229
we need to provide the ability for
people to access information

142
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,789
wherever they are from whatever device
as security professionals

143
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,379
we have to enable this freedom not
walking

144
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,419
as we think about it if done right the
security industry

145
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,029
can enable the future the information
economy

146
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,080
it's up to us to nurture and provide a
path

147
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,330
for your organization's to seize these
opportunities with confidence

148
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,810
if we work together we can help the
information economy

149
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,850
reach its full potential thank you very
much

150
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,779
that
