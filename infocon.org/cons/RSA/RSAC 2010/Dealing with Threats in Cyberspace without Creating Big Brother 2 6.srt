1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:04,570
michael internet describe all of the
chief reservations of the system we want

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,230
to preserve

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,910
democratic capitalism if you will

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,729
is the ability to

5
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:14,249
be suspicious of the government
skeptical of its moves and have access

6
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,070
to redress

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,039
how's that possible in south africa
offering cancer privacy you know that's

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,899
a great question 'cause you can say well
we need to do network security

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,789
for our national government and then you
could say

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,399
you know what would a close society that
doesn't value individual rights or have

11
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,680
a constitutional democracy

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
uh... do and then you could say you know
what would a country that believes in

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,780
the rights of individuals and bounces in
in power do in your probably come up

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,710
with two different solutions

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,420
so i think we need to be asking
ourselves those kinds of questions we

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,010
think for example to little paradoxical

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,800
but we think transparency an openness is
very important i need some

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,910
accountability

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,050
if the government says we're going to
take these steps we need a safari

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,620
you need to ask yourself well who's
going to be on the other side

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,560
assessing those decisions about letting
those decisions

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,930
now that's a very interesting year you
brought up because

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,880
richard you're indicating we really need
a

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,560
combination here

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,950
that the private sector needs to get
involved

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,560
the private sector in some ways has more

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,829
rights of privacy

28
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,979
than the government that second with
hold more information about what it's

29
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:25,939
doing

30
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,810
uh... you walk the swine left but the
problem is that the government

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,510
has discredited itself in the last
decade

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,530
the trustees if we had trust in the
government before that i think

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,110
lot of what's going on the last decade
is a road that runs

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,340
the cyber command that's being stood up

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,869
is an essay

36
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,799
mhm and

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
unfortunately it's the only cable block
organization the government has to deal

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,790
with cyber security

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,620
homeland security department and the
secretary's going to be here a little

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,630
while talk about it is beginning to
build capability but they don't have it

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,640
an essay is the wrong organization to
defend

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,229
the private sector it's the wrong
organization to defend anything they

43
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,750
don't share well except that i think
they do some things very well that's the

44
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,179
problem some respect

45
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:14,669
there the right organization to defend
the military the wrong organization to

46
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,510
defend the private sector

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,009
problem is right now no one is defending
the private sector

48
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,419
and the theory of the obama
administration seems to be

49
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,939
cyber command defends the military

50
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,279
d_h_l_ switchgear you would get

51
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,939
defense with bob dole dominated

52
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,319
and the rest of us are on our own

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,250
that's not going to work

54
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,400
i think that's the paradox here

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,400
enter the challenger have between people
who don't want the government involved

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,889
and those who recognize the government
has

57
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,519
and not just unique capability but has
access to inside about what the threat

58
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,839
is

59
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:49,290
that is not available to clients

60
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,509
impressionist party building
architecture

61
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,109
that allows the sharing of information

62
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,469
at of coordinated response but and i
think marks porn is good you don't want

63
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,189
to certainly have the government
literally sitting in operating the

64
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:07,489
internet and opening and closing doors
because it's not hard to imagine a

65
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,499
situation like you have and other
countries where

66
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:14,699
someone makes a decision that the threat
isn't just uh... an attack baat mat that

67
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,949
an attack from ideas that the government
doesn't like even so the key is to build

68
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,269
a system

69
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,329
that allows pop chairman of information

70
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,299
that does put on critical infrastructure

71
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,769
our responsibility to maintain itself
because if one part of a network fails

72
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,539
the whole network for yeah

73
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:35,609
but preserves a certain deep between
them

74
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,099
and a certain amount of accountability
so that

75
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,309
the government can simply just run
roughshod over the private sector

76
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,639
and that's been a hard thing to
architect

77
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,699
unfortunately

78
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,979
i've government sometimes responds to
hard questions by avoiding them and i

79
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,809
think we are overdue to have the
discussion

80
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:55,269
complete the architecture and started
implement it

81
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,039
but at the key here i think is exactly
what you do both uh... which is to have

82
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,059
somebody else

83
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,559
the government can establish

84
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,659
guidelines they can say that we want off
education

85
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,439
but the government shouldn't be the one
of those the authentication

86
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,999
and it shouldn't required on every
network

87
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,159
but it should so look at it

88
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,769
when it comes to screening traffic on
the back row

89
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,309
in a lot of the problem would be solved

90
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,839
if that's your one last piece were
required to do the back of inspection

91
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,649
we can have the government do it

92
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,009
right now the problem homeland security
is building this thing called einstein

93
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,039
einstein three

94
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,009
that's not something that we can port
into the private sector

95
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,599
but we can

96
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,249
solely i asked these by regulation
regulations a dirty word in washington

97
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,020
but we could buy regulation solely chair
when i asked these

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,740
you have to do d packet inspection for
malware

99
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,690
as long as the government itself isn't
doing it

100
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,180
and i think we can avoid some a privacy
or you're okay with the violent

101
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,729
telephone companies doing this kind of
thing

102
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,020
now copper well they are

103
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,399
i think we have to get the and think
that the careful if we go down that road

104
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,349
i mean

105
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:07,759
certainly telephone companies have
always had the right

106
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,090
to listen in on their minds to insure
quality and to improve service there's

107
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,380
no

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,059
absolute prohibition against a
communication harrier

109
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,430
having access to content it's very well
understood

110
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,249
but we've had a lot of difficulty i
think over the years keeping that sharp

111
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,469
boundary

112
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:26,050
between

113
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,639
you know service delivery and content
filtering or

114
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,180
getting access to content for even
advertising purposes because the truth

115
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,620
is in a deep packet inspection opens the
door to a commercial opportunities now

116
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,150
you know a lot about your customers that
you didn't know beforehand so what

117
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,120
you're doing with the department's
likely ask her to see this of course is

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,990
the is the problem because you know the
company's concerned what we have to do

119
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,699
this because of our security mandate
abad away there's a market opportunity

120
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,770
and maybe we should be pursuing that
simultaneously but you can do deep

121
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,400
packet inspection without looking at
content you can look for signature

122
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,410
well yes but but i think

123
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,150
what i said at the outset was that if we
go down this road really have to be very

124
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,610
careful because you see one rationale
easily collapses into another and what

125
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,710
began as you know fairly good security
technique

126
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,599
open the door i think to a lot of the
world as a role for government there's a

127
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,809
role for government

128
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,460
which is to make sure that when they are
espy's do

129
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,839
deepak inspection there only looking for
certain

130
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,889
right have government do inspection

131
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,849
have a private organization

132
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,770
so it could be on inspection

133
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,810
yes projected recognizes easy to talk
conceptually the actual writing of the

134
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,639
rules set that draws highlights very
very difficult

135
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,620
it doesn't mean we should do it

136
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,379
because i agree i think you want to have

137
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,250
capability to look at what is moving
over the network and the only way to do

138
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,280
that is to look

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,109
you didn't pack an inspection

140
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:50,009
and maybe you need to make sure your
initiation does that is not the same

141
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:50,699
organization

142
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,599
or aspiring fans from people who market

143
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,870
but but writing that we're all set

144
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,020
is tough and then of course inevitably
there'll be some unanticipated

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,490
circumstance even getting to the issue
of liability i know

146
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,649
marks used that telephone companies

147
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,499
hi i have that right elias resented by
the united states to and that that

148
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,459
freezes equal opportunity i think

149
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,050
so i i think that problem

150
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,099
you probably have a fair amount of
agreement but with the challenges but

151
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:22,759
you cannot underestimate the difficulty
of translating that into rewriting the

152
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,639
specifics

153
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,159
at the end that we still come back to
this point

154
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,639
i sang it's hard and therefore let's
talk about it for another two or three

155
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,400
years is exactly the wrong when you get
taken down ninety minutes kind of a

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,309
problem nominal interest your because
we're talking about these as

157
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:41,209
civil structural or procedural issues

158
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,219
richard you started out by saying the
tools have failed

159
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:47,949
people have been hacked is the stuff
good nothing it's just not being applied

160
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,149
correctly as a which are saying that the
other stuff is obviously not good enough

161
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:54,999
but what needs to be done but what we're
looking at are for architectural

162
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:58,460
solutions that don't rely on every
company doing

163
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,969
everything right

164
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,549
to say to every company you have to have
all your patches up to date you have to

165
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,460
have all these systems

166
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,900
it's not going to happen

167
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,190
therefore you won't look for ways
further up the food chain that you can

168
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,860
have some effect

169
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,559
and one thing that you can do and
unfortunately involves regulation that

170
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:21,310
unfortunately it raises privacy concerns
one thing that you could do

171
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,649
that may be a sixty percent solution

172
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,889
that makes it a lot easier on individual
enterprises

173
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,789
used to require the tier one i asked
these to do some sort of inspection for

174
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:32,790
about work

175
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,950
with appropriate

176
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,780
regulation

177
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,900
with appropriate public transparency

178
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,959
that's a step in the right direction but
i also want to point out werner things

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,420
when we get into these discussions they
tend to focus on network defense which

180
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,330
is obviously important but there are a
couple of other barnard believes there

181
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,920
is a hardware and software that we use
in our systems

182
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,040
with which is devised a written in other
parts of the world and to have a big

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,790
within it bonior billions of flaws

184
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,020
and then there's of course the people
operate on the system

185
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,770
hotmail point of it

186
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,439
questions i ask for use as we get a good
idea to conference with this

187
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:09,450
and has a thumb drive what to do with it

188
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,030
why throw my neck

189
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,610
but a lot of people go while it's free
let me stick it in the computer and who

190
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,050
knows what they stuck in with so you've
got to start to write rules and how

191
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,810
protocols

192
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,750
recognize that human beings are on the
network and you have to be able to do

193
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,600
with that security bombed marginally so
i want to say two things i mean i think

194
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,060
one you know solution to this problem

195
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,690
that would have involved so much
government involvement is some

196
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,450
high-level certification program

197
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,590
within the industry to really

198
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,580
you know the private sector

199
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,900
to establish credentials to do with
richard things needs to be done

200
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,640
to raise security awareness poker-faced
something else for that we can we say d

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,019
p i something like i have a

202
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,280
an opportunity yet

203
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,710
push back a little of the folks over
dennis say they're not just interested

204
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,710
in looking for malware

205
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,000
other very interested in content they're
very interested in that's why there and

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,940
they kept the ones are
