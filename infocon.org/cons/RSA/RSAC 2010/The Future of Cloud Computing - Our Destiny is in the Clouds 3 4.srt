1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,440
at these are safe and in fact you know
when you think it through its a

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,179
it's really a good thing because what's
that wants one of the role of government

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,830
the role of government government is to
protect the nation on one hand at this

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,570
is a subir warfare

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,330
and you had before that you know
discussion about it and the second one

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,740
is to protect the individuals

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,840
and today as we all know we all have to
go onto the internet

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,150
and a the risk of being mad

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,320
is quite significant so i think is very
well coming to have the government for

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,149
him to be

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,420
for really very serious

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,350
at you know and being here so or that
problem so for those who have not had

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,860
the opportunity to

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,610
here the the Keno the for our new
cybersecurity czar

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,610
very happy to eat to introduce Howard
Schmidt in our digital world

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,949
the information technologies we depend
upon everyday present us with both great

17
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:03,730
opportunity

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,900
in great danger for national security
public safety in our economic

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,939
competitiveness

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,549
as well as our personal privacy our
lives have been rich in callus ways by

21
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,540
technologies

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,740
arnelle part over the very fabric for
day-to-day lives

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,920
our dependence on these wonderful
technologies continue to increase with

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,049
each new innovation

25
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,680
as does our shared responsibility to
protect our security

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,159
in our Privacy indeed as president Obama
has said

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,930
the cyberthreat represents one of the
most serious economic and national

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,070
security challenges

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,869
we face as a nation as such I look
forward to working with our leadership

30
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:39,960
from congress

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,850
industry federal departments and
agencies state local and tribal

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,840
governments

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,170
as well as our international partners to
ensure that our economic

34
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,920
and national security interest are
enhanced are combined cybersecurity

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,549
efforts

36
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,740
because ultimately no one not government

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,909
not the private sector that individual
citizens can keep us safe and strong

38
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,590
alone

39
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,850
when it comes to cyber security our
vulnerability shared

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,880
and so is our responsibility to ensure
that our networks are secure

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,420
trustworthy rezoning so as I told the
president

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,170
I'm committed to bringing all the
stakeholders together around a new

43
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,640
comprehensive cyber strategy it keeps
America secure

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,800
in prosperous thank you howard and

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,150
if we look back to the these videos

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,970
that we have the in this neck so there
is a is a common threat to love them

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,709
and these are one

48
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,480
as we discuss that the technology is
really moving very fast and it's

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,050
becoming

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,220
totally unpredictable to understand what

51
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,110
is going to be it impact the second
thing is that that

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,849
obviously requires that we think
different I

53
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,940
we cannot continue thinking the same way
and think he is obviously not enough

54
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,970
a we need to act and I

55
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,140
different so were clearly

56
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,510
on RB crossroad up these are not going
to you

57
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,670
get better soon but I believe you have
the hope of making them better

58
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:19,459
so as I mentioned earlier I think the
opportunity is really

59
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,980
for all of us together to have that goal
in mind

60
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,860
a building the security into the very
fabric

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,920
the cloud and in doing so making it
practically

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,739
invisible and what I think it will
require

63
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,720
it would withdraw a toward it different
I did June between the security vendors

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,909
we as security vendors up to return

65
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,489
out to Cooper out to me to collaborate
together

66
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,849
at creating true integration between
out-competing solution if this

67
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,730
what it takes because one company cannot
do it

68
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,640
anymore I'm sure you recall some of
these a

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,640
up speeches made that because we have
sold millions up sensors

70
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,150
we know all that great landscapes and
therefore should buy from me

71
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,709
you're going to be protected so that was
probably true

72
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,209
two years ago it's not true anymore

73
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,310
there is also some fundamental building
block

74
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,280
have the clout that we have to make more
secure

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,330
we need obviously a more secure browser

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,570
we'd also what I call a single

77
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,840
the secure single sign-on so when we go
into the crowd you know we don't have to

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
managing all these different passwords
and so forth that's

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,720
another problem which needs to be sold

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,070
so this is going to require the
commitment of the individual which are

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,080
working at that to really

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,340
thinking more than just the leader

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,320
interest %uh their companies that we
start to understand that this is a

84
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,479
bigger problem here that we want to
seoul

85
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,590
and I think if we tap into the community
which is as we very well know today

86
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,320
computing us change it's not anymore I
they used to call the priest the

87
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,070
up for technology in direct contact with
the God of technology providing

88
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,419
technology to the mortars

89
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,470
today communities are extremely savvy
very knowledgeable

90
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,780
I think there's a huge report unity to
hap into the F

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,220
effort other communities if individuals

92
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,620
and I do believe today that community
like the ice is said many others will

93
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,470
have in fact more power

94
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,990
because now they can really influence
and push

95
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,820
you know the vendors whether they are
the traditional security vendors are

96
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,930
worthy of the cloud computing vendors

97
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,930
to centrally go at fulfilling that
agenda

98
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,430
let me give you your a few links that
there's many more by the

99
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,949
I was like to recognize the Jericho
forum

100
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,350
and for the very simple reason that good
G that the jerk off or members which was

101
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,319
about a group for

102
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,720
food C-one hundred large companies which
were

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,009
trying to influence the vendors

104
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,090
to change the way they were doing things

105
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,330
they were criticized a lot then simply
because they had the vision

106
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,169
before many many of us that the business
requirements and the technology combines

107
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,630
where century a foresee it but

108
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,819
forcing us to up in a bow networks

109
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,919
and therefore making the security in
that environment

110
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,610
harder and harder and harder as we just
discussed earlier

111
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,669
and that's what they call the
parametrization and then they've all

112
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,800
to start to understand that after all
the end goal is

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,349
collaboration in the cloud and how do
you make collaboration into the plot

114
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,880
secure their old quite a few

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,509
interesting papers about that and then
most recently they aren't you lucky you

116
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,139
can if in a self-assessment allowing us
to try to find out

117
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,400
if all cooperation before doing you know
the room

118
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,449
right these enough you know to

119
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,470
isn't removed from that transition to
securing ok

120
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,630
all current network to the new word I've

121
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:26,039
leaving if you prefer in the cloud then
you're no the Cloud Security Alliance is

122
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,210
have also put the paper that Alex Tomos
a

123
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,590
with put we publish that on our website
that i text that most

124
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,789
a created because

125
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,669
it awaits it's scary should go and look
at this paper when I look at it the

126
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,620
first time I saw my god

127
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,930
this is a lot so I told him I said extra
duty divided into pieces

128
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,270
one which is the seventh these you need
to do and then

129
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,500
a the second page the other 25 of 30
things you need to do

130
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,770
its mindboggling to see the complexity

131
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,990
the number of things we need to do do in
fact

132
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,550
be immune to some degree to attack like
or are so welcome you to go to see that

133
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,360
paper

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,639
there's another book which had input
here that out

135
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,460
really recommend that you read I forgot
the name of the author at my age you

136
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,690
know you start to forget a few things

137
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,819
but I i remember the name of the book
this good

138
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,259
this cold thinking the unthinkable

139
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,680
and this is the book all about that
acceleration of technology

140
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,149
and that we cannot really predict in
fact trying to give use

141
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,430
give us you know some mentor if you
prefer

142
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,539
techniques a so we could start to

143
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,440
think the in the cover and be there for

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,000
much more ready to adjust to changes

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,649
for those who believe that we are not in
and I threw should have changed let me

146
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,580
give you another

147
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,010
personal example example have my
grandmother

148
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,440
my grandmother was very nicely

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,470
educated by the by the Sisters

150
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,600
finish school at 16 and a half years old
because she was considered very smart

151
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,860
sensor the finishing up thirteen years
or

152
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,450
the giver three more years a free
education

153
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,470
and my grandmother so in one life

154
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,450
the first commercial bicycle and the
first man in the moon

155
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,649
right that you today technology is
accelerating

156
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,360
even faster so without

157
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,660
I would like to leave you with a very
strong message of hope because

158
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,860
if life I believe for the IT people is
not going to be fun because I meant to

159
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,980
be dislocated be

160
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,880
time thanks of cloud computing so for
them they will have to readjust I think

161
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,870
from the security people is a unique
opportunity

162
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,930
because security people find them a tour
or as you all know

163
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,490
its obviously about to very far

164
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,390
this is our job to make sure
