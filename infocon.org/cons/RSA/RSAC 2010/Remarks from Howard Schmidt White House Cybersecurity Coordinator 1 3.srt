1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,360
thank you thank you very much and boy
what a stop

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
way to follow a morning are between art
and sky

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,590
and Enrique and and the crypto guys and
the awards

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,710
it's really a tough position to be in
but I'm really really

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,529
a happy to be here and thank all of you
for inviting me in attending

6
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:21,510
you know it's interesting it's great to
be back amongst those are really making

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,400
a difference

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,269
and a lot of people have asked about
sorta history have our say

9
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,900
and if I'm not mistaken this is
somewhere around the 14th or 15th

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,980
our essay event that I've been to and

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,989
you know we all know things have changed
dramatically over the years

12
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,629
I and one other things that I think
relative Dr say specifically

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,730
that I was talking about yesterday we
should he be getting here

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,710
how things have changed because I
remember that in the early days when I

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,460
first signed up for our say we had some
devices that we don't use that very much

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,250
today

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,020
and you probably play with them as
matter fact I think they're called I'll

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,199
Japan piece a paper and a fax machine

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,539
you actually somehow got a piece a paper
you filled out your name

20
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,810
you fax it in this someone and they
later on somehow confirm magically that

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,520
you were coming

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,479
you know but I was also the years up in
a in in

23
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,420
that's what I think just 19 your var
saat the anniversary coming up

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,400
there was also the years that we were
looking and for those who remember sort

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,900
of the dock master years

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,310
where we had the National Computer
Security Center

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,799
we had a big computer system a lot of us
were involved in the early entries into

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,570
the Internet

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,240
and the ability to do that and it's
funny when you start thinking about

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,579
how much we've collaborated how much we
work together over the years

31
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,189
a lotta goes back to early dock master
days no effect on the early intrusion

32
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,530
detection systems

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,509
was built around the doc mister work we
had a lot of court cooperation we had

34
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,920
private industry we had acted

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,130
academics where intelligence community
we have law enforcement

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,369
better other interested people were
putting together and I was all back in

37
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,079
early days above Rs a

38
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,229
but I think there's another component to
that i won also mention disorder

39
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,110
trying to somehow bring us together
Scott to mention the World Health

40
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,180
Organization

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,610
and all this can sit here and just this
week we can we get 20 lawyers in room

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,020
get twenty different opinions

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,200
how things work the same thing with us
and security but when he was in room and

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,660
figure out the best way forward

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,330
look at twenty different opinions so
we're always trying to coalesce with

46
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,870
some sort of what's that sound like in
the real world

47
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,590
in vent server a you know obviously
great great person and a good friend

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,379
and I were talking a few weeks ago and
he brought up something about a fire

49
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:32,980
department

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,239
now clearly we look at the fire
department take all

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,430
is the emergency response we're good at
that but also I have to realize and I

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,950
ask you to think about this for a moment
not only are we really good response

53
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,300
but in so many different ways we've done
a better job being proactive now split

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,209
the wood art said with Scott say when
you re K said

55
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,280
about being proactive so I want to just
take a few minutes

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,379
hopefully not boring you too badly about
sort of the the comparison with the fire

57
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,980
department and fire world

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,830
if you think back historically something
which catch on fire

59
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,470
it would burn to the ground people often
tied with go around CG is bad girl

60
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,680
had burned to the ground we have to go
rebuild it miss Melissa we needed

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,159
do something about this sick start the
build communities next two bodies of

62
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,590
water

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,860
that made a lot of sense they were
closer to the things that it took

64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,900
to fix things we see that my development
community today

65
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,030
early days in development we were just
doing it on our own member the first

66
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,540
program I wrote trying to do

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,830
earth-moon earth communications for ham
radio stuff

68
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,159
no guidelines we were close to the river
didn't know anything about security

69
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,269
we develop in the same thing they
started moving closer to where the

70
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,220
resources work

71
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,310
we actually create communities a people
coming together

72
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,709
in the developing world and sore the
next piece that was recognized well

73
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,049
that's well and good but the fire start
you run down to the river by you get

74
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,220
back you may

75
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,299
may save an outbuilding but oftentimes
it's too late

76
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,540
say start to build the disorder the the
the volunteer fire departments and

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,299
building in

78
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,159
places where water restored close by
annex start to train people

79
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,690
has not what we've been doing we've been
taken a great talent the rich and robust

80
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,630
capabilities that we have

81
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,210
in the developing world and say we're
gonna do better training

82
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,900
when you get these resources together
would give you the tools to give you the

83
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,229
training

84
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,919
give you the ability to make the tight
code make the budget deadlines and all

85
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:35,990
the things that bitter

86
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,009
so to the pressure points on people
doing things

87
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,300
just like did not fire world we train
these people come together

88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,870
and so now only where we then at that
point able to protect the outbuildings

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,790
we had a better chance up recovering
things

90
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,520
that will be lost forever had we not
done that but that wasn't enough and we

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,699
know that

92
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,810
so what do we do Sardar don't we start
looking at what things that really

93
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,840
happen

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,940
of things are flammable so the next
thing is why we make them less flammable

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,000
same thing in our world how do we make
things

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,889
more resistant the summer the attacks
that we've seen

97
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,900
we no longer have the debate that we had
at one time is

98
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,580
why in the world would someone type in
259 characters in this thing

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,710
because they can't because it breaks
things the same thing applies there

100
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,930
we wind up we start building things that
are less flammable we save lives

101
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,740
so what happens we have a better ability
to recover

102
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,690
but without enough no just like in our
world that's not enough yet

103
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,759
so we shortened looked a little bit
further than that so what happens if

104
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,080
because we have to use materials that
are their flammable

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,770
in our world we have to do things that
sort of escape from

106
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,310
what we used to call the barriers in the
the firewalls and sorta

107
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,610
your building everything behind a wall
and we need to go outside we need to

108
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,870
conduct business we need to have the
ability to go out and touch on things we

109
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,240
needed a

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,970
so what they did in enough in the fire
bench world short on sprinkler systems

111
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,530
shop indeed the things that you needed
to do with bill for some reason

112
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,650
we had an ability to see things be able
to fix it images move on

113
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,460
and that's where we are today at I don't
care what anybody says out there

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,120
it's the work that the company's you
work for the work that you're doing

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,130
that the developers the people there
watch when doors looking in this space

116
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,470
you're making a difference not somebody
with the

117
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,830
doom and gloom predictions that things
are falling apart quite the contrary

118
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,870
you all are the ones that are making a
difference

119
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,199
I think in that vein we have to fully
recognize that the importance of

120
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,080
cybersecurity is had in so many
different aspects about

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,350
our lives on a day-to-day basis

122
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,430
there was a discussion this morning
about sorta I think was our talk about

123
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,169
being sandwiched in between

124
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,860
you know or Scott between two factions
the the kids and in the in the mother

125
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,860
well you know how it is were the CIO for
our neighbors and friends

126
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,389
were the ones that get the call things
don't work right

127
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,590
and those calls oftentimes these things
relative to cybersecurity

128
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,509
so as a consequence you were the ones
that are making the difference

129
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,060
but all with that we recognize that
there's a part that the government

130
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,729
industry needs to work together with

131
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,160
and surprisingly enough I'm not gonna
stand here and talk about private public

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,699
partnerships are important

133
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,699
or developing strategies we've been down
that road

134
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,250
so many times where wanna talk to do
today is talk a little bit now

135
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,880
and when when I'm up specially proud to
do is talk about sort of the role that

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,880
we're taking as we're moving forward

137
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,270
because one other things right I'm very

138
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,569
but if the problem is the fact that I'm
here representing President Obama has a

139
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,870
cybersecurity coordinator

140
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,099
you know in this role which i think is
is an important role

141
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,330
obviously I'm not doing this alone I'm
working across all the

142
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,620
different aspects a federal government
coordinating the development

143
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,900
I'll be harmonize and system ice
cybersecurity policy

144
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,889
I work across the federal leadership me
intelligence the law enforcement

145
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,819
the defense to civilian agencies and all
the government communities to make sure

146
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,400
the basically we're

147
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,750
doing what we need to do when it comes
to cybersecurity efforts better

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,770
once again harmonized affective and
efficient

149
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,050
but no we can't do it alone once again
there's a key role for our legislators

150
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,819
and this

151
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,629
no wind wind chairman and and Harry and
Scott were pure talking about the

152
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:27,840
commission is it feel

153
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,260
on the award there were two congressmen
up there that are very instrumental miss

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,219
so clearly will work with congress to
make sure that we've got a role

155
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,320
helping guide shape what their role is

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,630
and of course our industry leaders for
nations

157
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,970
and state and local governments
obviously were on together

158
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,370
because we recognize that all these
vulnerabilities are share and we have to

159
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,440
partner together

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,540
to make sure the cyber networks are
secure trustworthy in Brazilian

161
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,620
I also make sure that we work closely
with Vivek Kundra

162
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,080
the CIO the government and any show
Oprah the federal chapter

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,560
chief technology officer and there's a
couple reasons one

164
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
we fully recognize in talking with them
the

165
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,350
securities not something you belong
later its kind to be built in what we're

166
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,110
doing

167
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,180
so is the nation's moving forward
looking for new technologies

168
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,820
not only within the government but
outside how do we make sure as we have

169
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,959
this discussion about the next
generation of food whatever foo maybe

170
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,390
that is done in a secure and privacy
protecting manner

171
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,510
and I've really come there respect their
understanding of the issue

172
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,839
because they're part of the partnership
I also have a responsibility with the

173
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,709
national economic council I think that's
vitally important

174
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,339
everybody in this room knows that
security is just not a very binary thing

175
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,100
that we look at you do security nothing
else matters

176
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,570
we have to recognize that our cyber
security policies

177
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,300
are you have to be well aligned so we're
looking at the digital networks

178
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,950
so they've remained robust resilient but
