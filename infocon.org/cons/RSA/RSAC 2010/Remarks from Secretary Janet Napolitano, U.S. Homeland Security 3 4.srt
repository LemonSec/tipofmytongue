1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,270
less it has the support our
professionals and have a public

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,770
that understands how this Ste how to
stay say

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,030
1 I'm lie us so we need to have

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,630
a ongoing two-way conversation

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,470
on going to weigh effort between the
public and private sectors

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,560
I way need to have an ongoing

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,410
multi-faceted effort with the public at
large

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,289
and we have to recognize that we have
different audiences that we're speaking

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,460
with we're talking about cybersecurity

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,890
there's the fifteen-year-old up

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,649
who already could probably go work for
many %uh view although I up to the

12
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,219
grandparents who is beginning to use
email so that he or she can

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,989
stay in touch with the grandchildren and
maybe follow the stock market a little

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:53,600
bit

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
up to to everything in between so we
have this

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,620
very public I and we have to recognize
that

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,430
anytime anybody gets on the system they
are on a system

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,510
and what we are a working towards making
sure that the system writ large

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,159
is say and that is secure so as we work
on well how do we talk with people about

20
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,250
this

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,340
are some love you have already been
involved and I want to thank you

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,470
I members have the IT communications and
the other sector coordinating councils

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,790
working with our department I'll

24
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,130
and in they are in what is called a
cross-sector cybersecurity working group

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,420
which is a big name up or concept that
is very important

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,280
which is how we make sure that anytime
anybody gets on a system

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,210
they appreciate that fact in-the-know

28
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,909
a good cyber habits as part of our
overall cyber

29
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,890
security are so I i would like to

30
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,610
suggest that this is an area where the
private sector where you

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,630
could be very very helpful

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,910
up because up we have to have a system

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,620
that works together we have to get to a
more reliable

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,940
level of performance within that system

35
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,300
so a on a pause

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,610
here I'm going to make an announcement
here in just a moment about about the

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,590
messaging things you want your help on

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,980
but I'm asking you before that to
redouble

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,190
the efforts that you are making to
increase security

40
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,690
to increase reliability are

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,010
and two in increase the quality of the
products

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,019
that you have that enter the global
supply

43
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,379
cheney we have to get to a level of
performance in the information

44
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,239
technology infrastructure

45
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,590
hardware software that creates a secure

46
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,730
IT ecosystem because

47
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,349
goods and commerce are are are
transforming that in major ways

48
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,459
we have to get to an IT ecosystem

49
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,000
that offers automation of security so
that we can reacted internets p

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,129
interoperability so that there are no
technical barriers

51
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:21,140
to security cooperation and privacy
enhancing authentication

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,580
so that we can better protect our
systems let me say those three things

53
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,390
again

54
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,670
that we are asking for the private
sector to help us

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,849
leapfrog forward automation up security
so that we can react

56
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,900
internet speed interoperability so there
are no technical

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,230
barriers to cooperation and privacy

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,590
enhancing authentication so that we can
better

59
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,780
protect our systems and today I'd like
to go a step further and ask olive you

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,480
and all of our industry partners in this
field to continue working on

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,290
additional common sense goals I'm so

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,189
for example I we need to as I mentioned
before

63
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,659
in this ecosystem increased public
awareness

64
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,500
increased public awareness that
everybody is part of the system

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,069
if when it would be funny if it weren't
so scary that

66
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,310
there was a recent a surveyor
drycleaners

67
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,250
a dry cleaners in the United Kingdom
that

68
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,259
estimated that customers left over 4,500

69
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,830
flash drives in their pockets last year

70
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,630
4500 was an estimate I

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,460
another survey found that thousands of
smartphones and other devices

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,710
are left in London and New York Paktika

73
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,910
cabs each mop a and

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,970
a that is all in a place or 30 percent
of americans still aren't using the

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,470
internet and are just beginning to

76
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,900
I get online get on the system so that
underscores

77
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,190
a challenge that we have a president
Obama has called for national

78
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,330
cybersecurity

79
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,240
awareness campaign many have you have
already joined this national effort

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,820
I and I'll we need to recognize that

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,770
those answers are found not just in
Silicon Valley or

82
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,889
Washington DC a but it's in the wisdom
of crowds

83
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,560
it's in the creativity in a classroom
it's in a series of small refinements

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,090
enlarge technological leaves

85
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,800
I it's local regional national and
global

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,840
so today I would like out to issue a
challenge

87
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,850
and the challenges a for you

88
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,270
to tell us how we can best promote cyber
security

89
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,150
I we want you to develop your own
approach

90
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,789
to a clear and compelling message for
the american public

91
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,190
we would like to on and

92
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,289
engage in that approach with the
competition

93
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,500
together and share the most creative
ideas

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,550
for making the public more cyber secure

95
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,750
more cyber smart more cyber assured

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,240
details on the competition are now on
the DHS website

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,490
the contest will close on the 30th April

98
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,440
and the entries will be judged on
criteria including teamwork and

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,919
partnership

100
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,389
use a web 2.0 technology and privacy

101
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,650
protections up Wireless in the

102
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,430
challenge the DHS National Cyber
challenge

103
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,449
will be invited to special event in
Washington DC

104
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,710
later this spring and DHS

105
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,240
will partner with you as part of the
National Cyber Security Awareness

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,850
Campaign

107
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,130
and its launch during the month of
October

108
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,930
in other words we're asking you help us
develop the message

109
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,800
do a little competition I'm always
competition is good

110
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,389
submit your ideas that to us by April
the thirtieth

111
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,110
and the winners will be back to
washington not only that

112
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,810
we will then bring the resources and the
Department of Homeland Security the bear

113
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,050
and terms are using your messaging
efforts to get to the american public

114
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:20,849
writ large a the website is DHS dot gov
slash Cyber challenge

115
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,490
DHS dot gov slash Cyber challenge

116
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,270
I and I expect we're gonna see some

117
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,940
great ideas are viewing past you think a

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,500
that this will not help us and helping

119
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,009
protect this entire entire cyber
ecosystem

120
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,229
that I have describe let me just

121
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,580
a remind you about the campaigns on

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,379
or spires I am stopping smoking and some
other things

123
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,699
that have literally changed human
behavior

124
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,970
as they have gone at it in a massive way

125
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,599
that is the scale we are looking for
that is the scale

126
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,979
we are looking for what let me a

127
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,639
close a these remarks

128
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,060
in a somewhat different way a

129
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,870
listen you all are in this a rare you
would not be in this conference center

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,080
today the challenges facing our nation

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,190
are urgent then involve International
Security them all our national security

132
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,250
both from a physical infrastructure
standpoint and from an intellectual

133
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,030
property standpoint

134
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,190
I they involve every level

135
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,630
from large federal institutions to

136
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,769
large corporate institutions down to
each individual

137
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,140
who gets online which of course is

138
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,830
is why this is why this is

139
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,690
something that we all need to focus upon
jointly

140
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,800
but we we we have to have a sense here

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,120
have moving quickly affected affectively

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,920
innovatively creatively ways that

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,140
in the United States we have set the
example

144
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,230
on so many time I and the Department
months to be

145
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,480
a facilitator for that a partner in that

146
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,510
recognizing that this ecosystem this

147
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,810
it. cyber ecosystem is changing has
changed even while I've been

148
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,050
on this platform now

149
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,680
on last Sunday I V

150
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,910
opportunity to be at the Olympics

151
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,360
at the gold medal game a hockey game I

152
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,399
and it was a great game I know whether
any be sought

153
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,380
I all the athletes a perform

154
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,230
remarkably well senator wonderful fast
sport

155
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,120
I am where nothing ever stays still

156
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,540
are and I also had the chance while I
was there too

157
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,850
me when Gretzky and Wayne Gretzky

158
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,019
courses nickname is
