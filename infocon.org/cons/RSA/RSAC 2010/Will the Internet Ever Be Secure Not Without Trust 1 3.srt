1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,879
Justice Court or mission because our
mission is to service the

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,299
financial security in the men and women
this year this great country and

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,550
therefore in order to

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,630
provide home X can screw they would
expect day in and day out

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,180
on that's what we have helps us earn
your trust and keep their chest

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,300
security alone is an adequate for the
wide adoption of cloud services because

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,490
it's really enabler for trust om

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,420
if security is used to build trust in
cloud services

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,890
in the providers that are providing the
services a

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,480
my belief is that you'll see a far
greater adoption of cloud services

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,950
the difference I would seem to in
security interest to security something

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,250
we have to provide to our members to
ensure that

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,460
were helping meet their financial needs
trust is something that we and have been

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,430
able to provide that handle security

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,699
when there's a deficit a trust with our
customers it makes doing business

16
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,780
incredibly difficult um bottom line is
that our customers don't trust you

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,489
dinette going to deposit the money wish
you that I get the chance actions a

18
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:02,350
business issue

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,240
a lot of people have lost trust in
financial institutions and particularly

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,170
large banks

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,040
and so it's very important that it stays
cold or mission that we provide

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,630
the highest level security in order to
maintain our members trust

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,799
our customers a expectations that their
folly

24
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,360
increasing when it comes to their
expectations of how we protect that data

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,570
they know that their threats that
increasing and blue

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,520
both in complexity on to end this in
terms of sheer volume and they expect

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,420
this to put the proper mechanisms to
protect that data

28
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,680

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,300
thanks everyone good afternoon pleasure
to be here get the arse a conference

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,870
as many of you know and I 1991 I
organized the first

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,300
arce conference and we came to talk
about demonstrate

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,110
cutting-edge security and over this
twenty years we've seen an explosion at

35
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,710
threats

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,130
there were viruses identity theft now
where

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,020
denial of service attacks hijack
machines botnet San

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,440
a lot more and their corresponding was a
corresponding explosion up

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,480
security solutions all you have to do is
look at the exhibit hall to see what I'm

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,310
talking about

41
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,650
now all them can can reduce risk but
they've also

42
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,720
overwhelmed and confused and sometimes
frustrated users in fact

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,490
summer the security tools that we offer
nearing the point of negative returns

44
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,600
sign with our start thinking about
security is only part of the solution

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,330
and what argues users need promise so

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,920
let's take a look at it from a user's
point of view today the face with

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,630
pop-ups

48
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,800
all sorts of security procedures that
were designed to make them feel more

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,670
secure

50
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,390
but in fact may simply frustrate them
and make them wonder if the Internet is

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,340
quote safe

52
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,590
and in fact the question can you trust
the Internet

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,300
answered in survey after survey
indicates that we really are quite there

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,769
yet

55
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,800
that fact a lot of the solutions that
we're providing

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,360
are the causes this people see the
solutions their cumbersome they get

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,019
their way

58
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,530
they have to deal with them and they're
wondering if the security products are

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,150
indicated above up the underlying threat
sorta like driving through a

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,130
neighborhood with up

61
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,739
whole buncha warnings about the high
crime area about the entire on

62
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,980
you may feel a little bit safer seeing a
lot of police cars but you wonder if you

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,410
can really trust the experience of
driving through there

64
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,500
so let me I'm go back in time a little
bit and

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,570
try to dry try to draw straight line
from

66
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,080
the period up at the seventies in the
eighties between the founders out that

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,540
up the arse a company diffie-hellman
rationale a man in all the pioneers in

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,040
public key cryptography

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,870
and today one thing that all of them did
in their papers

70
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,110
they also have had an introduction to
their

71
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,690
their scientific papers that invented a
lot the technology that's

72
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,599
represented in products that companies
here today they all said something to

73
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,340
the effect that

74
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,650
where we're moving to I i sort over

75
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,130
cyber community and I they all talked
about the need for protecting digital

76
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,020
information

77
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,700
South think of it this way there's a
simple way to think about this that's

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,609
maybe a little technical but not too
much

79
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,709
they were describing the world in which
basically

80
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,160
most of our lives in and all the data
that we deal with his digital

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,780
and in a world where all that digital
data exist

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,140
your reach a point where you can't trust
that data

83
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,050
unless there's a reason to that reason
is called a digital signature

84
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,180
you trust information because it's got a
digital signature on it

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,349
so that digital data may have no value
there

86
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:43,680
they'll come a day when there's no value
associated with digital data

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,900
unless it has a digital signature
attached to it what digital signature

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,789
doesn't really have any value

89
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,700
unless there's a certificate associated
with it sorta like a signature that

90
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,979
doesn't have any value unless its
notarized

91
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,650
and a certificate doesn't really have
any value unless that certificate itself

92
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,849
is validated

93
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,470
and a useful analogy here would be yeah
if you are an online merchant

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,660
ass selling t-shirts books or CDs

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,599
would you take a credit card online from
someone without bothering to

96
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,620
determine if it's valid or it's been
revoked her hot listed

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,669
on of course you wouldn't so

98
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,849
path forward a little bit got to 1995
couple really interesting things

99
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,410
happened in 1995

100
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,640
one was that microsoft and netscape

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,970
commercialize browsers and you know the
Internet which was

102
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,650
a little difficult for most people the
years became the World Wide Web in

103
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,840
e-commerce came along and fortunately at
that time

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,599
there was some infrastructure available
and some technology available and I got

105
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,990
built into those browsers

106
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,200
and there was just enough security
infrastructure I

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,180
SSL impact which was just the right
protocol at just the right time

108
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,210
to let e-commerce flourish and there
were really two questions that people

109
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,650
were asking at that time

110
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm gonna go online and shop and
actually conduct commerce

111
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,830
I'm concerned about a couple things I'm
concerned about whether I'm talking to

112
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,740
the right party that I think I'm talking
to

113
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,360
is it really them at the other end of
this transaction

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,510
and they're also saying is my
information protected as it moves to

115
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,199
them

116
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,479
is it to encrypt it is it that protected
from people who might be eavesdropping

117
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,139
or stealing it and SSL answered those
two questions

118
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,110
it was just the right sort of security
infrastructure at the right time

119
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,800
and it worked really well and I think it
provided a sound basis for

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,850
for e-commerce security and does so even
today

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,080
but today help consumers have many more
questions they're not just asking Who Am

122
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,340
I talking to is my day to say

123
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,419
at asking questions like I click on this
I

124
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:48,120
well i get some our what will I get in
fact that while I have a virus

125
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,000
azasite safe to go to an how did all
that money get into those Nigerian banks

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,419
in the first place

127
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,520
questions like that that they're asking
themselves and

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,169
so at any rate I'm everyday people are
facing these threats and I think again

129
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,680
it leads us back to that that

130
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
that survey result that says a lot of
people are not comfortable putting

131
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,460
private information

132
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,460
on the Internet that CIA CIO's in CT
ozark faring

133
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,080
a whole lot better there are also
struggling with some at the same trust

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
questions

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,380
today they put together their networks
and you know what might be a

136
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,410
less than scene was sorta collection
have point security products and other

137
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,860
defensive measures and

138
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,120
and wonder what they've messed and
wonder my what might be going on in our

139
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,910
network

140
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,340
and whether or not some our has managed
to get a

141
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm everybody here at this conference is
talked about cloud computing so there's

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,050
you have no need for me to eat to beat
it up and say we have to trust the cloud

143
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,150
before use it

144
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,100
but I can tell you that most
corporations and certainly the ones that

145
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,320
are public companies

146
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,560
are going to have directors and auditors
were going to insist that their some

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020
level of trust

148
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,600
before they start committing corporate
data regardless of what

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,770
the economic benefits are so we have a I
think that a lot of work to do

150
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,810
before we get there but the economics
are very compelling

151
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,340
I think we will get there but we need to
develop some trust first

152
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,699
so basically consumers and businesses
have a an issue

153
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,680
with trust I they want to trust the
internet but they're not really sure if

154
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,669
they can

155
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,070
another thing we really need to focus on
is simplicity

156
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,250
we gotten to the point where there's so
much complexity out there

157
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,979
that introduces new new risks computer
security practitioners now

158
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,520
have known for a long time that
complexity Eagles rest

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,380
the more complex the system the more
places there are where exploits can

160
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,750
can be brought at so what we need to do
is deliver not just security but trust

161
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,699
so security is critical and good leading
edge security

162
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,209
have to underlie anti-trust proposition
but security alone does not equal trust

163
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,550
so let's explore this idea I have a to
people

164
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,250
with me today to help us do this from
the network operators perspective I have

165
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,449
can sell his Versailles is chief
technology officer

166
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,520
who operates quite a large network and
you'll see some interesting statistics

167
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,650
about that network in a minute

168
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,490
and it's also a network that's under
constant attack in ways you you may not

169
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,540
be aware

170
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,589
and after can we hear from Fran Rosch
fran has a senior vice president

171
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,150
a business-like vacation fran has a
really deep understanding

172
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,290
the relationship between merchants and
consumers what that trust relationship

173
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,470
looks like today

174
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,449
what it what it really needs to look
like in order for e-commerce to grow

175
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,449
beyond where it is today

176
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,589
has some up you may be wondering where
CEO Mark McLaughlin is

177
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,150
he has a good excuse not to be here he
and his wife welcomed a new baby last

178
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,660
