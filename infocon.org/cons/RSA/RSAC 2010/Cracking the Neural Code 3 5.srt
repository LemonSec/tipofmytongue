1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,040
the obviously a important moment for him

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
0 and one is milder users have words to

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,309
so in it in addition so

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,930
in addition we hooked up with a very
simple toy robot and and just asked him

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,550
could he

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,350
user a simple interface in control the
robotic quickly he control this little

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:21,949
robotic

8
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,580
arm to grab a piece of candy and handed
the someone and you can see me this is a

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,730
little bit awkward but is

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,349
he had never actually use this interface
or this this robot any figured it out

11
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:36,570
immediately but again it's the question
you know in a crude sense can you do

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,899
something to manipulate the world around
you again

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,190
so

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,300
if this is ever going to be a real
technology we have to do a number of

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,879
things and basically it's eliminate all
the things with the yellow arrow on them

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,079
the computer that is that big cartoon
electronics the process is everything

17
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,610
has to be made much smaller and more
portable

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,340
the technician has to go it has to be
automated and that plug on the head has

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,570
to be removed so we have a wireless
portable system that doesn't have a hole

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,350
through the skin

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,240
so we're in the process of doing that
and here's sort about prototype I

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,260
or a cartoon image above what we're at
we're doing

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,720
you can see a system this fully within
the body with that kind of smartphones

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,229
to pick up that will allow readout
information

25
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,360
and what you're seeing in the animation
is eighty develop a device were

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,729
developing that the fully implantable
system in which the electrode array

27
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,380
is implanted in the brain and basically
a

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,320
computer tower full electronics is as
miniaturized and mounted on a platform

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,630
that goes under the skin

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,880
they will transmit via infrared transmit
all the information out very high den

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,290
with

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,369
signal out at the under the body and
then we that close this is a

33
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,780
bloodless surgery that doesn't always
happen this in reality of course

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,070
I and is a little sensor on the outside
the picks up the signal

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,500
so this is already in testing in the
laboratory but isn't ready for human use

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,280
just yet

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,860
in so if we had such a system when we
get it going

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,670
what could people do to actually
interact with the world so I just wanna

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,079
show you three ways that were

40
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,560
approaching assisting or replacing a
restoring function

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,090
so one of them is to connect up the
signal

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,300
to a robotic limb that can achieve
functions like pour a glass of water

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,250
the people would want to do remember if
you're paralyzed you can even get

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,590
yourself a drink water you have to rely
on somebody else

45
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,780
this is a robot that is actually very
safe to use

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,110
it's produced by the German Space Agency
there's actually something

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,870
parts a bitter on the space station that
and because it's a very safe to use

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,430
robot

49
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,550
we're working this year to see if humans
can control this

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,860
and with brain signals and ended and
achieve useful functions

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,599
in addition it could be possible to use
bring gates' signals

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,440
to control something like a a a
prosthetic arm in this is a

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,620
state-of-the-art prosthetic arm that
does all kinds of fancy actions

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,120
the only problem here is that this
individual has two shoes which is to

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,730
achieve

56
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,739
those very impressive actions that can
almost replicate everything he could do

57
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,940
with his normal arm

58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,780
are but we what we're hoping is that we
could use this

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,870
connection from the brain to eventually
connect to the

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,069
prosthetic limb and so you have a
natural control and

61
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,110
the third we actually are attempting to
restore the connection between the brain

62
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,860
and the muscles

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,450
so they're is a system already

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,150
that is a stimulator that's implantable
in the body that can go to muscles

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,879
that's called an FPS system keep that in
mind for a little bit I'll come back to

66
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,519
it in a minute

67
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,110
the FPS system basically is now
activated by some external switch like

68
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,319
we going you're here are

69
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,580
jerking your neck and using that you can
activate the FPS Istomin move so here's

70
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,569
a video of a guy who has that system

71
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,569
he's paralyzed pay

72
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:49,569
so here's all close all close

73
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,330
hole

74
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,690
and ago this

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,580
but he's doing all of that action simply
by activating a switch that stimulates

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,960
as muscle so that they're about 600
people that have these kinda systems

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,900
but imagine now you can go directly from
the brain to the muscles that's pretty

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,510
much what we do when we moved

79
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,670
would be pretty close to being able to
produce on

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,160
I early kinda a system

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,570
so Hollywood gives us great inspiration
for where technology is

82
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,470
those of you who our Star Trek fans know
this is one of the early episodes

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,020
visit you this is Captain Pike

84
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,220
to measures me know and he's
communicating with a

85
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,230
I thought you might make an exception
for brain interface here and he's using

86
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,000
to beach for yes and or no and 1b for
yes the course

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,300
not much later we had that really a big
jump in technology for Sol

88
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,730
film I in which look sky Walker had his
hand cut off and within minutes he had

89
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,180
it not only %uh this prosthetic limb
popped up but it was

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,600
interface directly with his nervous
system so we was thinking in controlling

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,850
it

92
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,840
so we're someplace actually in between

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,470
we can we as I just shown you are
participants in the trial can actually

94
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,860
do better than Captain Pike

95
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,330
did and what you're seeing here for
brain gate now is

96
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,760
Kathy controlling an arm and she's
moving that arm to a dot on a screen

97
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,240
say for example a the screen icon and
you could if you look carefully you see

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,250
her finger flick

99
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,550
because she's voluntarily thinking about
contracting her finger

100
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,980
and what's impressive about this is it
is not just an animation

101
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,100
this is a complete simulation up this
FPS system

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,000
including the muscles and including the
electrical stimulation so she had this

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
system in her body

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,310
she would actually be able to move your
arm grab a cup and bring it close to her

105
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,550
mouth so where

106
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,370
we're actually better than Star Trek but
not quite up to Star Wars are real dream

107
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,870
are real dream is that some day will
have a person a spinal cord injury

108
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,930
no be out on the court shooting hoops
with Obama or

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,850
or someone who is the president at the
time and wit you'll never know that they

110
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,510
had a spinal cord injury that's a very
far flung

111
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,860
ambitious goal it's going to take
extremely long time for us to be that

112
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,420
good

113
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,990
at turning brain signals into into
control

114
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,300
so hollywood has also given its kinda
frightening images

115
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,840
I love up what happens when we merge
minded machines in a course that doctor

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,660
evil is a

117
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,250
the symbol I think that if it's even
humorous the silly images on this

118
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,080
on it is something that we are far from
having anything like this

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,220
we r dedicated to producing medical
devices to help people with injuries

120
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,330
but art our interest is always to

121
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,860
keep this in the public eye and to
always be examining the field about

122
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,380
where could this go and how can we
control it so that it is

123
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,419
done in an appropriate way and that's
something we'll talk about a little bit

124
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,080
after that

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,120
presentation so I want to close it just
telling you

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,910
that nor technology is already here and
I want to give you a few examples

127
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,300
up technology that is actually in
practice or or coming

128
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,590
that's in addition to what I'm to show
you in brain gate so

129
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,460
one of them is the bionic ear it's a
call the Coakley were implanted consists

130
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,850
of a stimulating electrode

131
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,620
deep in the ear and it's able to restore
hearing there about 270,000 people who

132
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,870
can now hear something talk on the
telephone

133
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,510
appreciate music as a consequence abyss
neural interface

134
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,880
there's another one that's coming that's
only

135
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,419
been tested in a few people are in which

136
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,419
it's a bionic eye so for people who are
blind

137
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,669
you can stimulate the back of the eye
and and and

138
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,450
some kinda images will go up from a
video camera

139
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,270
through the eye and up into the brain
and you can see images not flower

140
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,570
bundles like shown here but just bought
a blighted

141
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,530
edges and things so people are beginning
to be able to see who are blind but only

142
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,490
seeing say for example there's a big
white panel appear on the screen

143
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,000
and finally I think one of the most
remarkable and striking examples

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,510
is using a electrical stimulation in the
brain

145
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,000
to really remove the symptoms of the
disease so parkinson's disease is a

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,060
disease where your rigid and you shake

147
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,100
and you can see in the movie that lady
walking on the left

148
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,950
she has is very seriously debilitated by
implanting

149
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,479
stimulating electrodes about two and a
half inches into the brain into a tiny

150
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,390
structure

151
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,060
and stimulating them continuously you
can turn off those symptoms and you can

152
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,770
see what it's like when she has that

153
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,600
stimulus called the DBS on in which he
has it off you can see it wipes out the

154
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,409
symptoms

155
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,120
so this is an interface surprisingly
there are more than 50,000 people that

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,860
have this

157
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,260
technology already implanted in their
brains

158
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,510
so really biotechnology nanotechnology
is already here

159
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,460
so what I've shown you and I just this
is a you can hear the noise have many

160
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,800
neurons firing and you can see that the
net output to be able to control a

161
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,190
computer cursor

162
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,479
and I want to leave you with this image
I've we are able to carry information

163
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,210
we're able to crack the code a little
bit but not a lot but be able to make

164
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,599
some

165
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,099
early steps toward useful function going
from brain

166
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,570
out to real-world devices this kind have

167
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,580
I advance is really something that is a
new kind of science which is

168
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,930
highly interdisciplinary that involves
but many people and my colleagues

169
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,560
a are tone amigos an engineer and
physicist

170
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,100
Michael black computer scientist and
Leigh Hochberg was a clinician inner

171
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,500
scientists are all

172
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,310
part of a large team that's putting
together this this incredibly complex

173
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,300
system

174
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,810
so with that I'd like to thank you and
the invite our to come back out and

175
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,600
we'll have a little more discussion
directly

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,600
about the technology and where we're
going sites

177
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,119
the card

178
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:30,660
well thank you very much

179
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,230
John have only a short time but I have
many many questions to ask you

180
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,759
so will start straight away on from the
outside your work is

181
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,850
really quite of striking and from the
inside of course must be miraculous

182
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,040
we heard mats reaction on the the first
time he was able to control a prosthetic

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,509
limb

184
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:53,660
what with the reactions a some of the
others who experienced this

185
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,160
phenomenon and what is the that they're
hoping for next

186
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,910
well I think that that joy because
