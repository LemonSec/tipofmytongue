1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,290
glitch you notes rose one bit RAM that
can throw a walk

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,040
is little computer systems way our lap
and leave no evidence

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,340
what caused it yeah it should cascade
failure just being on

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,320
alpha particle or whatever it could be
on you know other acts like than your

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,550
bugger by allowing or the interference

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,789
so I don't think I don't think sometimes
acting like we understand mechanical

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,369
stuff

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,930
I don't think the are acknowledging the
fact that these on a little

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,260
laws can happen often but rarely in

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,430
the computer stuff too way you know

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,980
but I I love Toyota I'm gonna buy more
upon and I think it's not on say

a while endorsement man the with a

13
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,350
let me ask you this me you understand
how technology is built on the isley

the first what worst rosalynn probs

38
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,010
always say yes if some strange is
happening left let the world of

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,420
creativity around you

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,120
go to the next level always say yeah
after we had some crazy idea

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,440
and have no we just think of anything
crazy I don't know where it comes from

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,950
what is an idea for you know a new
technique in a computer come from

43
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,650
yeah that show how to call my cousin no
other we call the po po kamusta

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,720
yeah it sounds if it sounds funny amping
I've been

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,870
I've been blessed to have a very good
light I had a very enjoyable life and I

46
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,019
like to do these things are

47
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,000
unusual in resting the sort things that
make movies out over tell stories out if

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,930
I i love that

49
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,069
are like not super serious you can't
ever have fun you can't ever tell a joke

50
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm kinda on the opposite spectrum and I
think that a lot of

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,810
playing with this misbehavior but not
being really a bad dog

52
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,140
to rip people off I think that that's
really and big element

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,450
up developing creativity creative
thinking in your own mind

54
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,769
and almost all the creative from
technical people I've ever met

55
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,830
have stories like that in their
background how they tricked got the the

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,769
school administration almost always
comes into play product they had a stack

57
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:14,610
of stuff on me

58
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,760
so thick and they could never print me
because I was a dossier

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,260
I'm smart enough I got caught so many
times in middle school I learned you

60
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,510
know

61
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,690
if you can play some French you don't
tell a single person you do it all on

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,000
your own and nobody gets

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,080
atrazine full deniability yeah

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,870
what you know the problem I think the
land

65
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,830
you guys use the blue box and Captain
Crunch in the 2600 megahertz

66
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,500
with in band signaling right so you you
accept it what what what doesn't matter

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,739
me it was a flaw on the phone system you
to put

68
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,739
tones into an American phone and dial
anywhere in the world for free

69
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,940
it was kind of a weird thing to discover
but

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,670
you know it was just its it's not that
it had some important

71
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,390
relevance to the world but you know what
the thinking that went into trying to

72
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,239
design the best

73
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,269
locked in when the world that make
summer some other technical

74
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,730
what's really came about later came
about my own mind

75
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,700
in but my own arm designs up even the
Apple computers

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,030
were in from the techniques if I could
tap into that same

77
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,829
thinking right if you put on the same
hat that you had back band members of

78
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,430
the thinking

79
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,630
it's more the motivation of wanted this
one device

80
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,050
that's a bigger motivation than a
paycheck sometimes is little intrinsic

81
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,009
rewards mean a lot to you on the inside

82
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,590
not the one to show the world on the
outside like your title your salary how

83
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,479
many yachts map

84
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,470
home you know your awards you get those
art extreme sports everyone sees

85
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,199
but the ones that just a personal to you
mean a lot to you are gonna drive you

86
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,660
and your gonna cheap those

87
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,360
like a floppy disk for Apple we have a
meeting and that was two weeks before

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,830
the CES show

89
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,259
first time ever they were gonna allow
personal computers that Apple

90
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,940
Commodore Radio Shack long time ago
three companies

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,330
M three people were gonna go from Apple
are marking dicey jobs

92
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,889
our sales guy and I've never been on a
California never seen Las Vegas like

93
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:02,750
heard about it

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,470
I said if we have a floppy disk in which
show it the back of my head on your

95
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,729
I develop a floppy disk in two weeks all
get to go to Las Pinas

96
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,949
I haha that kinda but OK

97
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,470
and I children at work every day
Christmas and New Years and everything

98
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,270
and just barely 6 a.m. the morning the
show had it all done in

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,229
you could type run checkbook and it
would run the checkbook program of

100
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,300
lobby the motivation was so much greater

101
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
you know you can't buy that you know I
don't know

102
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,850
I don't know how you can hire that I'm I
it up pic by the way go on the link then

103
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,940
we're talking about the social networks
in awe

104
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,169
yeah on the link then what you do is you
send somebody a got a great job of it

105
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,520
for you I'll send you a a

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,949
also you um an application form at sent

107
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,449
a course they could want to be epic you
take them into some Adobe flaws or

108
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,240
be some other arm you know Trojan
program and want to run a program in

109
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,400
somebody's computer

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,669
are so many ways to con people still you
know

111
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,789
let me ask you but that is if you see
you know you got to that same motivation

112
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,930
intellectual curiosity

113
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,210
and then you look at social networking
today how popular it's become how many

114
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,120
people are on it

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,949
and you look at the cloud you know on
all the certain new technologies

116
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,590
what do you think driving that that
disorder

117
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,750
hacker up tomorrow by what kinda
innovate he you know

118

119
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,440
hackers

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,550
I'll on you know the happy with him in
the white hat side once

121
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,960
wonder that rants that we're not
anticipating now if you can look at this

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,720
technology change

123
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,009
where some the big things that you think
from your perspective and

124
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,840
experience I'll be truthful I'm not a
hacker

125
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,020
on you know and we hear a lot about
things like identity theft I don't

126
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,560
really think about it that much

127
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,740
arm I I think it's all a matter

128
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,120
education everyone's open to you know
what hackers where they want to get the

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,830
I'm

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,000
smoothly talk their way into it may know
all the pharmacy

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,060
you go on the third the the popular
website

132
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,949
there for example I was just I was
backstage us check out one of my

133
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,030
favorite sites

134
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,199
it's %uh please rob me bombing of purple
almost

135
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,250
I did not have my home today and there
on Twitter's

136
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,560
tweets and on Facebook and then they get
people said the man they get to put in

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,960
on this website

138
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,630
who would I love how they position that
psych is it's like

139
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,130
Atletico like a broad array of
opportunity portal

140
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,550
I that a lot better that way

141
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,560
but but you know that that's that's one
interesting application I think

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,090
a people that are looking at this data
they're looking at technology

143
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,630
and saying how can I leveraging for bad
purposes

144
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,319
and you going back to the days at the
Apple to

145
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
what what am I looking up I think white
hat hacker those how can I

146
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
leverage it to have fun to play with
play with people are sure of something

147
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,479
that they don't

148
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,150
didn't think was possible it's not you
know it's not to take money

149
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,169
up to make money yet stock even
curiosity computer files get lost or

150
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,120
anything like that had just curiosity
