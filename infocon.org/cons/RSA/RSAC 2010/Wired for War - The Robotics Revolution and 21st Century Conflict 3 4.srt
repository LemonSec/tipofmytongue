1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,009
this eliminates the calling power
suicide terrorism

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,120
it gives individuals and small groups

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,410
a greater reach but they also don't have
to be suicidal

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,580
so it means that both and al Qaeda 2.0

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,840
but also a next-generation version ima
timothy mcveigh are far more lethal

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,260
a good illustration of this is and more
work to

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,449
hitler's Air Force a look walk while
couldn't hit the United States

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,590
couldn't fly across the Atlantic a
couple years ago

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,300
a 77-year-old blind man designed his own
drone

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,100
that did fly across the Atlantic one
person's hobby

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,309
maybe another person's pop and then the
final

12
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,239
trend to keep our eye on is new sparks
of terrorism itself

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,800
the return love the neon lights that is
not

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,800
everyone is excited about this future
excited about this technology

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,690
some people wanna stop it some people
are scared by in essence what we're

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,860
talking about here

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,449
is unibomber 2.0 but again

18
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,630
just like cars are not just use by
terrace per car bombs

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,360
we have to broaden how we look at this
technology in some other perils of it

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,760
so for example in the realm of crime we
see everything from

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,280
I drug smugglers using using stealth
technology to cross the border

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
to people using computers for identity
theft

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
and so we may see this whining use a
robotics in this ROM is well we think

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
about law enforcement

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,220
but there's another ripple effect i
think is

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,140
maybe even more important its the impact
of all this

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,369
on our own democracy robots take certain
trends are already happening right now

28
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,560
in our democracy

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,720
maybe to their final logical and in
point we don't have a draft anymore

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,740
we don't declare war anymore we don't
buy war bonds or pay higher taxes for

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,729
wars anymore

32
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,320
now we have a technology that allows us
to carry out AXA for

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,700
without having to worry about the
consequences up that letter

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,950
going to someone's mother and so

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,600
what was happening is that the barriers
to warn our society were already

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,259
lowering

37
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,599
and now we have a technology that
literally lowers them to the ground

38
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,410
I don't think this is a theoretical ship
I think we're seeing this play out

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,580
right now using unmanned systems we've
carried out more robotic

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,400
airstrikes into Pakistan then we did
with manned bombers in the opening round

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,650
the coast civil war just ten years ago

42
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,410
but unlike the co civil war we didn't
have

43
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,830
a debate about it in our congress
without a single hearing on it in our

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,450
congress

45
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,519
media doesn't breathlessly report about
it we just did

46
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,830
because we view it as cost less to us

47
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,860
the irony in all of this

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,950
is that while we may be using more and
more

49
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,610
technology all and the rebel faxer
robotics

50
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,220
a really about human psychology we have
another policy dilemma that we have to

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,040
figure out

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,200
what are the impact robots on the

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,890
more about ideas that were fighting
against radical groups around the world

54
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,269
what is the message we think we are
sending with robots purses what is the

55
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,819
message that's being received

56
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,099
so can I went around interviewing people
about this in one of the best

57
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,530
illustrations I thought was

58
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,080
arm interview I did with the senior Bush
administration official

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,590
we describe how are our own man and were
quote place to our strength

60
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,760
the thing that scares people is our
technology

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,959
but what about when you interview people
on the opposite side of the coin this is

62
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,599
what the leading newspaper editor of
lebanon had to say

63
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,980
and actually what while we were talking
a drawn this line the bottom right at

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,530
that moment

65
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,620
said quote it's just another sign the
cold-hearted

66
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,010
cruel Israelis and Americans were also
cowards

67
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,379
because they send out machines to fight
us they don't wanna fight is like real

68
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:49,879
men

69
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,129
but they're afraid to fight so all we
have to do to defeat and

70
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,060
skill just a few of their soldiers or
for example

71
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,489
and Pakistan 10 the leading rock songs
there last year

72
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,370
and lyrics that describes how quote
America fights without

73
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,110
honor looks a pakistanis the same way it
looks at in sacks

74
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,000
this things to squash from far I'm not
saying that these are realities

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,820
they are perceptions but of course in a
war of ideas

76
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,110
perceptions are very important I think
this has broader ramifications including

77
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,340
at home

78
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,850
as we see domestic law enforcement

79
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,900
incorporation start to use this
technology as well

80
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,030
everything from of for example the
Houston Police Department

81
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,030
to Department of Homeland Security are
all using

82
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,780
robotic drones for observation now

83
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,630
same kinda question what is the message
that's being sent out on this

84
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,880
on one hand a very powerful tool for
gathering information

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,669
that not only can be used for
prosecution but also maybe even has a

86
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,350
deterrence value if people think they're
being watched by the all seen eye in the

87
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,590
sky

88
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,650
but a lot like how the computer
introduced not just greater processing

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,050
power but also deep questions a privacy

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,810
the same thing here in fact I member
meeting with a federal district court

91
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,500
judge

92
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,310
said that basically within a couple
years we are going to have a Supreme

93
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,130
Court case

94
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,660
on all of this because this technology
cuts to the heart of definitions that

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,120
not only privacy

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,410
but also probable cause

97
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,070
another report that well before you get
into a world where machines are

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,190
autonomous making your own decisions

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,110
we're seeing changes and demographics
who can do what

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,360
and war one of my favorite stories is

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,759
about a 19-year-old who was a high
school dropout

102
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,740
he wanted to make his dad proud of him
again so he joined the army

103
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,430
you wanted to be a helicopter mechanic
but the army said

104
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,810
he wasn't qualified to be a helicopter
mechanic because he failed his high

105
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,340
school English class

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,330
they asked him would you like to be a
drone pilot and step

107
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,990
he turned out to be incredible ah he
turned out to be a natural so to speak

108
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,539
it really wasn't that it was a natural
because he'd grown up playing video

109
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,699
games wit

110
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,990
a joke was Whitefield high school
English class but the point is it turned

111
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,169
out to be so good

112
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,360
that after his first tour of duty they
brought him back

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,840
they promoted him to a specialist
basically his tally got raised to just

114
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,410
about to

115
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,720
twenty-two thousand dollars and then

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,850
they made him an instructor and the
pilot training academy

117
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,539
it's a neat story from one perspective
through this technology this young man

118
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,860
found himself

119
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,319
serving this nation made his dad product

120
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,759
I told the story at the Air Force
National

121
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,590
Association convention they didn't like
it

122
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,550
Yahweh 19-year-old high school dropout

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,840
enlisted man in the army

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,139
was not just a pilot instructor but

125
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,360
has taken out more targets arguably help
save more american lives

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,360
than any single F-fifteen the pilot in
essence

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,789
they look at him the same way the
Knights look at the peasants

128
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,639
just when they were given gun power but
as you saw

129
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,690
robotics are not just things that move
or obvious I dislike r2 d2

130
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,800
they also are changing us themselves

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,319
we're starting to put technology with an
S so the pentagon has sponsored research

132
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,569
for example

133
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,000
that arm by which quadriplegics have
been able to control computers by

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,539
thought alone

135
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,130
while hundreds of soldiers have lost
arms and legs

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,380
due to these ID's and have them replaced
with robotic arms and legs

137
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,000
headed the program describes it as a
look sky Walker fact member Empire

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,110
Strikes Back

139
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,960
louganis hand cut off with the audience
go Mike goodness what's gonna happen

140
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,569
and then it into the movie BCM flexing
his robot hand

141
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,629
that was science fiction when I was
growing up that has been a reality

142
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,979
for more than four hundred american
soldiers

143
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,310
a few of these have even had USB ports

144
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,729
put in their bodies to allow the
software upgrade software updates to go

145
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,210
easier

146
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,560
but of course win you are not just using
digital technology

147
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,139
are carrying on your body but have it
within your body

148
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,889
it raises new questions have not only
privacy but also security

149
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,789
who games access to the information of
what I am actually doing

150
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,680
and of course software my body gives an
entire new meaning

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,020
to computer virus much of what you're
hearing here

152
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,370
is that they are always two sides to a
technological revolution

153
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,570
Moore's law may be operative but
Murphy's Law

154
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,659
isn't disappearing we're gaining
incredible capabilities

155
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,820
science fiction like capabilities but
also means we have science fiction like

156
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,260
the limits that we have to figure out

157
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,870
now sometimes people say that mean
things don't work out with

158
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,130
are robots its Justin hoops moment and
that's what I i'm vice president a robot

159
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,580
company said missus and group moment

160
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,300
will water group moments when we're
talking about robots

161
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,480
and war sometimes they're kinda funny

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,279
like one time when they were testing out
a machine gun armed robot

163
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,810
it went quote squirrely it started
spinning in a circle

164
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,350
and pointed it's gone at the review
standard VIP's who were there to watch

165
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,690
they were happy that there were no
bullets in the gun a time

166
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,180
other times these groups moments can be
tragic just about 18 months ago in South

167
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,089
Africa

168
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,360
an anti-aircraft cannon had equal
software glitch

169
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,550
it was supposed to fire upwards into the
sky during a training exercise

170
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,769
instead it leveled and it started firing
in a circle

171
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,240
it killed nine soldiers Fort ran out of
ammunition

172
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,459
hoops how would you investigate

173
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:52,490
these kind of incidents I would you
attribute accountability

174
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,100
what laws would you turn to and that's
really the challenge here

175
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,810
is our laws in particular
