1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,690
other very doing good afternoon

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,389
her body tired out don't be leaving back
there

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:15,349
alright the time for cocktails yet
almost

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,029
alright hey listen I thought it was an
amazing message

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:24,710
by Secretary Napolitano we have seen
some amazing things happening

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,460
in the past year our threat landscape
has been elevating

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,520
we've been seeing someone the most
horrific insidious attacks

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,190
that world has ever seen and this
community

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,440
at the RCAF and is an amazing event for
us to all come together to learn to

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,219
share

11
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:47,320
and it's really a great effort I think
by the Secretary to really reach out

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,079
public-private and this is a little bit
what I wanna try to do here today as

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:51,739
well

14
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,930
is what were some the learnings how do
we share

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,949
some the information on the recent
attacks that we've had

16
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:02,230
and we've had a lot it's hard not to
pick up a paper

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,360
newspaper almost every day and see some
the attacks that are happening

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,740
McAfee has been fortunate I guess in
some cases

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,299
to be in the middle of something the
biggest ones we've seen we learned a lot

20
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,840
a big part of my message today is to
tell you what we learned

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,380
when we sharing and particularly what
McAfee strategy is

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,240
going forward because we've been
evolving very quickly as a company

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,329
we think that we've really created some
amazing intelligence in the cloud

24
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,250
technology on the premise that can
really help stop

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,200
some the major attacks that we've been
seeing in the marketplace soul

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,390
wanna tell you bout to particular
attacks am just gonna spend a minute and

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,810
talk to you about ones that you read in
the newspaper

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,509
ones that you seem over the last nine
months one in particular that's happened

29
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,649
just in the last six weeks you all
recognize pretty quickly

30
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,079
and tell you a little bit about what we
learned through that process

31
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,020
and then tell you a little bit about
what we're doing behind me you'll see a

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,840
bunch of numbers

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,680
these numbers are very important numbers
much to tell you what they are just yet

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,070
I will tell you the numbers on here have
a lot of meaning

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,000
numbers on here are the key to our
strategy going forward

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,610
to take a look at them for a minute and
the very last line I'm gonna show you

37
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,239
is actually with the key to those
numbers actually are we seem to be in

38
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,040
cyber attacks in the past year

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,480
probably more actually but to ones I
want to talk to you about

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,739
the first one is all about this number

41
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,209
how many view I can see a show of hands
to easily here but how many of you know

42
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,590
what this number is

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,140
this IP address

44
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,190
is a very important number if you knew
about this IP address before the attack

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,629
that happened last summer you would have
been protected

46
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,019
you knew about this number

47
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,959
it was probably the most important
number you would have known last summer

48
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,030
this number right here was involved

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,120
and initially a very large botnet

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,790
spam attack not significant unto itself
although botnets are very popular we've

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,590
seen a lot of them

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,379
Secretary Napolitano just mention one
that we we saw yesterday and today in

53
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:09,989
the papers

54
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,819
but a large spam attack that was
generated from an IP address

55
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,980
reached over 200,000 computing devices
pretty quickly

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,060
but that wasn't really until this number

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,659
really became malignant and really
started to destruction

58
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,750
that knowing about this number became so
critical when you look you're on the

59
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,840
stage for a minute

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,129
I brought out some appliances most if
you have this secure corporations or

61
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:37,670
government

62
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,810
the server email filters web filters

63
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,349
these email spam filters picked up
obviously this botnet attack

64
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:49,379
wanna vendors have this technology we
picked up this number

65
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,569
but really the key to this was learning
and understanding

66
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,689
how to create a reputation to this IP
address that originated the botnet spam

67
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,260
attack

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,489
and really create some sort of score

69
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,010
I was much more elevated were has a
reputation has a much lower score

70
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,099
so that we could educate in crate
intelligence

71
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,780
everywhere else in the network this was
critical

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,009
how was a cloud intelligence system

73
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,489
communicate to the Bison's in real time

74
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,620
and understand the reputation a
particular IP address

75
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,990
and with over 200,000 baht nets in
leverage

76
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,530
and with a IP address it could go
malignant at any point

77
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,810
we began to see wanna destruction

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,190
many probably know what this attack was
about the mound where itself

79
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,490
was very destructive as well we saw all
the malware

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,570
deleting files over reigning master boot
records

81
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,650
and really creating a pretty destructive
environment for hard work

82
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,860
so hundreds of thousands machines
involved with the very minute piece

83
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,930
amount where

84
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,960
but also used in a spam attack and
eventually turn out to be

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,630
very destructive force that happen on
July 4th

86
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,889
you all know this probably is the Korean
attack originating out a career South

87
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,270
Korea but really hitting a lot a
critical infrastructure

88
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,910
as many people were probably home
barbecuing on 42 joined America

89
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,580
we really ended up seeing a pretty
disastrous scenario occurring as a major

90
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,320
denial of service attack was launched

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,380
with all the headlines a release all
this major critical infrastructure was

92
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,289
brought down

93
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,210
this cost millions of dollars to the
very infrastructure that we

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,600
support we did a research study

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
we will released and the world economic
forms the couple weeks ago

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
more than 600 companies were surveyed
more than half of them had experienced

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,240
major outages and I will service in the
past year

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,620
most of them thought we'd see it
increase and then I'll service again

99
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,740
this year

100
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,039
the average denial service cost was 4.8
million dollars

101
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,800
this type of attack has a lot of a fact
but understanding

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,460
these IP addresses was absolutely
critical

103
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,770
we had companies that McAfee was
protecting

104
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,940
that we were able to stop the entire
traffic flow

105
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,910
and the reason why the reason why is
because that's spam filter

106
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,440
an Email Gateway could indicate the
cloud that cloud

107
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,100
couldn't talk to the firewall and stop
and drop traffic

108
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,500
on demand so we could prevent a major
denial of service attack

109
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,560
this was very very powerful we kept
learning

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,840
that using and leveraging intelligence
in the cloud from one vector

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,479
I E an Email Gateway SMTP pipe protocol

112
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,520
to another vector like a firewall was a
critical component

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,300
having success in this attack in doing
so

114
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,740
a day 0 critical ways to think about how
to solve these types of attacks

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,330
in the future will forward to the second
major attack

116
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,169
Mosab you know this attack this one kept
me up at night for weeks on end

117
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:15,970
as a did many of the McAfee researchers
and engineers in the company

118
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,349
a lot of you probably know this attack
this is what we call operation Aurora

119
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,990
probably seen this is a China Google
attack

120
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,229
certainly had a lot of words we've
learned a lot about this particular

121
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,349
track as well

122
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,789
one vector understanding another vector
key

123
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,560
what happened in this particular attack
we learned a lot here as well

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
you probably also all this was a date
january 13

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,509
actually generate wealth Google releases
block

126
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,050
right the first time we also all this
publicly

127
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,620
for those who weren't under NDA with
Google you ended up saying publicly

128
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,870
Google's block

129
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,060
the very next day what did you say major
headlines in almost every newspaper

130
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,169
round the world

131
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,410
sixteen seventeen companies affected

132
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,470
confidential information potentially
breached

133
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,690
rights activism at the root of it

134
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,860
pretty interesting attack right before
that

135
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,530
days before that we learned in our cloud
about the malware samples that we ended

136
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,289
up posting announcing

137
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,419
already creating remediation for this
type of attack

138
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,699
prior to the announcement that occur
because we've been tracking this

139
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,849
Mauer the most interesting thing about
this attack was

140
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,349
not them our cell but actually how was
getting injected into the networks

141
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,050
themselves

142
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,440
this is where we discovered through our
network appliances

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,899
really what was up the cause is this was
at the cause

144
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,779
a major Internet vulnerability

145
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,100
we ended up not if I'm working with
Microsoft on it the start to see

146
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,570
a very interesting scenario unfolding

147
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,220
ended up putting out all the remediation
from system in a network in a matter of

148
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,450
a couple days

149
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,480
the intelligence on both sides we
learned a lot about what to do here

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,610
both on the endpoint and on the network
take a look at what occurred on

151
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,830
operational were for a minute

152
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,050
what was the target here we just
released this white paper today

153
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,760
all about learning how to protect
high-value I P

154
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,000
operation Aurora in our opinion was all
about

high intellectual property repositories

157
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,940

what happened here the first thing that

intelligence-gathering

164
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,200
well we after what was the adversary
after train
