1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,929
good afternoon it's great to be here
well i'd

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,950
I think it's great to be here because my
son my speaking slot

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,599
I notice that pitcher he was being
followed by the FBI

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,799
and for those in our history all know
why we're a little bit sensitive about

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,299
that

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,800
today really talk about

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,670
what we've learned in four years

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,000
cloud computing and why did that pic
that why pick that because fundamentally

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,219
those who cannot remember the past are
doomed to repeat it if we're

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,450
task with securing this thing called the
cloud

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,340
what does that really mean I thought a
lot about this and i win talk to

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,059
customers I talk to analyst

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,800
I talked to very influential person in
my life who's the chairman herb or

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,260
and it was a very interesting said a few
that I got in the past

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,390
there were several things that jumped
out

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,500
about securing what we call the clout
because many ways we've been doing this

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,489
for a number of years

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,739
the cloud is made up of a lot of
technologies that we've used

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,400
through yours computing in the next 20
minutes

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,689
on a run through a brief history that
and show you

21
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,780
what we can learn from the past

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,710
and how we can help us as we go forward
in this year the clout

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,909
to be a bit confused about the cloud
this week I have

24
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,960
is the cloud as you do to save your
ownership I'll

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,590
I T it's also never gonna make it
because it's got security flaws in it

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,979
and i hear all these different people

27
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,450
loudly talking about this in ways
reminds me i've

28
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,979
other here is a computing it happen how
did we get here

29
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,020
-ism architecture is that people
shouting loudly because they think this

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,470
is the next big thing to get a couple
dollars more value in their stock

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,290
depending on who you talk to it's an
interesting set

32
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,640
and it's a conundrum for us in the room
that our vendors

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,549
we've got some ownership in the problems
with that in really

34
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,659
we owe it to you the consumer
technologies how we can help you plan

35
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,189
for this

36
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,729
you look in the sixties and seventies

37
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,030
basically the remain friends and I talk
to the

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,770
from my from IBM who told me you know
the most interesting thing are both at

39
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,420
our say

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,420
is the mainframe people come over to in
point at

41
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,580
and say wow a mainframe like it's a
relative or a dinosaur

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,010
yet this is one of the key tenets of
cloud computing

43
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,620
back in the sixties and seventies this
particular environment was dominated by

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,230
one

45
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,190
key security feature authentication and
one

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,340
key physical security locks guards

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,860
people did allow people near it so

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,730
those are the big 10 its in overtime it
evolved when this came in to replace a

49
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,319
lot

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,300
love manual processes and it did things
that people thought could never be done

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,110
for business

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,230
well in the seventies happen and decides
disco

53
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,420
which bhadreswar forget this became in
Europe distributed computing

54
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,409
began the your the land which starting
up my career

55
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,159
Xerox back in nineteen eighty I can ruin
your the land lasted fifteen years

56
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,250
and the key issues with your the lawn
work

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,030
how are we going to secure all of this
information

58
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,300
that is now coming out the mainframe in
all Lord

59
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,239
getting near the end user this was the
beginning of the end users play

60
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,560
and control love information

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,819
and it required a different change in
the way we thought about information and

62
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,319
data

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,769
required that data itself had to be more
secure because of medication physical

64
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,180
controls for enough

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,290
and then

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,290
where the nineties and

67
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,530
the nineties opened a whole new Europe
empowerment now look for the user

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,830
but for productivity and other types of
computing devices

69
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,610
and the security of the last two euros
the seventies to the nineties and

70
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,519
nineties plus

71
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,280
Davis the security industry as a
stand-alone business

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,739
the rise of companies like McAfee and
Symantec rise have companies like

73
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:09,470
checkpoint

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,750
they all came because as we distributed
environment and empower the end user

75
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,419
we had to worry more and more about how
we protect the day

76
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,900
pgp was born in the 90's Phil Zimmerman
but

77
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,740
while at some point nation-states are
gonna want to read

78
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,430
your email they're gonna want to inspect
your business's

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,919
now we know nothing about that today
right that has never happened

80
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,990
as Aurora show this the best companies
in the world

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,540
are still subject to that data being out
there and being occurrence in be

82
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,860
invaluable

83
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,449
so three years a computing that lead us
up to the year we're currently and work

84
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,470
early in the cloud computing era

85
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,080
all attempts for their people moving to
the cloud quickly it's undeniable it's

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,160
going to happen

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,630
the money the amount love commerce that
this will generate

88
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,080
you believe the lower total cost of
ownership for it. communities worldwide

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,030
the enablement a collaboration these are
all things will once again lead to more

90
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,160
productivity

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,120
better products a better environment it
also has a chance to lead

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
to more and more

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,630
fundamental problems with the loss of
data

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,910
soldiers and influential guy in my life
this is the chairman the board

95
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,419
some you might know max hopper some you
might say whose max offering was filed

96
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,150
October talking about a

97
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,970
it's simple max Hopper was a guy back in
the sixties

98
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,419
who built a distributed environment it
was known as the Sabre system for

99
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,720
American Airlines

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,020
anybody's ever made an online
reservation

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,860
in the 2000's and beyond the orbit
system I was his team

102
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,060
he also did something if you've ever
gone to reverse a teller from back

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,020
America

104
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,960
his team also put out an industry so
want to maximize our chairman when I was

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,650
gonna give this talk I said max

106
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,940
you help me understand you built systems
from the sixties

107
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,650
to the nineties what were the key tenets
a protecting data through these here is

108
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,800
because I'm going to talk about cloud
computing

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,419
he said Phil there were two basic tenets
you had to worry about through all

110
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,539
through those areas

111
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,100
was access control the other with
security update arrest in emotion

112
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,300
fundamentally those were the two key
tennessee head worry about

113
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,610
through thirty years and he said it will
be no different

114
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,780
from a core technology standpoint as we
move things to the club he said actually

115
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,919
the cloud is your opportunity

116
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,319
to use is in very different ways a maxim
forcefully passed away

117
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,410
a a month ago he was a great man

118
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,690
great mentor and the computing industry
as a whole

119
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,660
pgp in particular the last few years was
very proud to have him and he was the

120
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,490
core

121
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,600
the idea of talking about these things

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,060
max also said have we done so I said

123
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,280
how we done he said yet how we doing on
that

124
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,470
control we do on that data protection

125
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,530
well data breaches are now costing us
two hundred four dollars per record

126
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,569
a new high we've been measuring for five
years upon Institute

127
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,740
significant money invested in losing
data

128
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,150
almost seven million dollars per
incident loss of data

129
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,130
so even though access control and data
protection have been the core tenet

130
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,710
for the past 30 years computing

131
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,759
as we go to the cloud we still are
struggling

132
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,139
was getting ahold love this concept

133
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,900
so many other things that are very
frightening that when you you think

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,630
about it in their contacts

135
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,310
56 percent in our room today is designed
to steal data

136
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,620
42 percent of the data breaches today
happen

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,370
with a third party involved is your
service provider consultant

138
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,639
you stop and think about that you think
to yourself

139
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,940
while are really ready to go to the
cloud really ready to share this data

140
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,830
anywhere and everywhere

141
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,160
that's again the conundrum core concept

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,699
30 years old we haven't been doing well
with an on-premise

143
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,650
and now we're talking about putting it
everywhere

144
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,360
seventy percent of the positions are
concerned about privacy and controls and

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,759
their environment

146
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,849
so most people are living in the United
States for this whole debate going on in

147
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:21,580
the country

148
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,970
called the health care debate eat up
most the press we have

149
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,729
and where the core tenet so that is how
we can automate health care how to make

150
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,190
it more efficient effective

151
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,219
his most of the systems there our
systems that have already showed you

152
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,000
pictures of

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,659
hospital my mother was in recently still
running backs is

154
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,080
its promoter hospital from the mines mom
was a similar situation in

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,269
he was so we're driving up the parking
lot realize you could read patient in

and yet seventy percent of his positions

159
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,390

166
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,130
he said yeah but I'm doing less and less
said was that he said I'm afraid

167
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,399
he said you know when my kids Facebook
page in new be amazing things that they

168
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,529

170
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,500
that's a big problem

171
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,120
recite going away gonna generation
people the rays with computers and

172
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,510

fundamentally

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,519
we as practitioners and we are suppliers
are going to have to figure out

176
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,720
how do we take advantage of these new
things that can help us

177
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,360
and yet at the same time protect the
data
