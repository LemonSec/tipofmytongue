00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,419
about the gas that we have for this
year's show so I'm not

10
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,710
bring a man a little bit we're gonna
talk a little bit

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,920
about how technology has changed soul
rapidly over the last couple years

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,929
especially things like social networking
and how can

13
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:50,210
customers how can users make good
choices online

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,489
and how can businesses make good choices
faced with all this complexity

15
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,249
so we've got some incredible gas up
before they come out

16
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,629
wanna share a personal security story
with you

17
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,050
and add this happen quite a few years
ago now

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,980
and it was really around the time it was
very significant i think in American

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,710
history

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,159
it was the premier up Star Trek
Generations

21
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,220
at and I how many people out here Star
Trek fans

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,299
act you high overlap not surprised with
this crap had cell

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:29,020
so this was at this a a pretty
fundamental time for me at this is kinda

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,439
passing the movie to work each

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,380
from Captain Kirk to show on Luc Picard
it's a big transition

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,329
and mean a couple buddies wanted to
bring it in the right way

27
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,430
and so we had this planned we're going
to watch all the previous

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,869
Star Trac movies jest in anticipation in
the opening Premier night so

29
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,380
I go to a buddies dorm and as much
people their most among my new

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,700
but there is one guy but I never met
before

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,969
and within I see within two minutes of
talking to him

32
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,189
he says I am have a second grade level

33
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,250
fluency Inc laying on I'm had an ass
getting following questions I is there

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,500
and Accreditation Board you know

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,920
hey do you really attached to this so
you know just how I pass to watch first

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,130
couple movies and I think it was after
rapid call I'm

37
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,090
that I I go back and I see this guy and
he's like hey check out what I felt

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,100
great see polls at this big book

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,019
am expecting some claim on manuscript or
something and I i read it

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,100
and it is the manual for the new

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,940
phone system it was just installed at
the University

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,000
I and he said I'm like dude when you get
this man had

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,840
it well you know I was sifting through
the trash outside the Registrar's Office

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,170
again no questions asked and I just got
a landslide

45
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,770
so I i look at this thing and the first
thought that popped into my head

46
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,450
is free long distance calls and so on a
couple buddies of mine and I just kinda

47
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,060
divided the thing up

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,610
at two hours and at least

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,750
at least $20 an ounce is a jolt cola
lader

50
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,970
we distill 3 important facts added this
big manual

51
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,950
back number one the way the system work

52
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,770
is that when he picked up the phone in
your dorm room and you dial the long

53
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,750
distance number and back bend to mastic
was long distance to see da link on a

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,860
long distance number

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,130
it ass you are at beach sand expects you
to type in your personal long-distance

56
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,170
code

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,370
so they know who to bill it to you a
couple people might be sharing a dorm

58
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,110
room

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,410
so not not unexpected and certainly par
for the course at the time so I was back

60
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,020
number one

61
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,120
back number two if you dialed somebody's
extension

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,030
and you got their voicemail you could
hit naw line

63
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,400
and get a dial tone originating from
their extension

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,600
aback I'm good mothers day that's okay
that's fine you know its discoveries

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,180
maybe obviously this was mitigated by
back number one because you'd still have

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,660
to type in long-distance ca

67
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,160
back to number three on page

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,440
276 in the manual

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,630
and find bread with the star next to it
at the bottom

70
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,280
anyone with compelling needed

71
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,500
can apply for an exemption

72
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,610
from the long distance code restriction

73
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,580
so what this is designed for lease what
it said is saying I really like you're

74
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,430
in the admissions office in gotta make a
whole bunch a long distance calls at

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,250
once

76
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,669
yeah and you're the only person in your
office you may want to lift this

77
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,150
restriction see just pick up the phone
Italian number and it connects

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,439
so immediately we see back in one pack
member to back number three

79
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,150
and we know what we're doing for the
next three hours and so we went through

80
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,500
the phone book and we started to dial in
an extension and admissions get to

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,129
downtown tried it out loud no dice very
disappointing

82
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,990
we tried somebody in a HR I'd figured
today gotta make much calls no dice

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,430
final aim we get so many I think ur
title was director of procurement

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,990
and craft service sets right so they're
bringing in food

85
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,389
and we had nine next thing I know my
buddy stalking his cousin in Jamaica for

86
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,430
20 minutes

87
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,590
actor met now what was interesting about
this to me

88
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,389
is with have a very very complex system
a complex manual

89
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,860
if you laid down those three fax and
presented like that too anybody

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,340
a designer the system are you sir they
recognize it does spell trouble

91
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,960
I it was clear that you combine those
three things in somebody's going to be

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,930
making some free calls

93
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,039
but because the system was so complex

94
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,520
neither designers have the system or
users have this system

95
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,870
readily recognize that and I think
that's very interesting

96
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,210
so today if you look at social
networking sites for example

97
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,330
you've got a law to complex of shins
around privacy

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,319
our users equipped to make those choices

99
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,349
you've got a law degree employees
they're talking about their home life

100
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,379
they're talking about their work-life

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,319
are they equipped to make good choices
about what they share

102
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,340
and not put the business at risk so
we're going to be talking about that

103
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,080
they ring their show

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,099
and our first cast is an expert

105
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,029

behavior

106
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:41,180

107
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,889

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,710
up to books on how people behave and
scams

109
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,270
I'd like to welcome him of Solomon

117
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:18,189
you've been talking all week about

118
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,430
how to keep control the people who were
involved in social networks what they're

119
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,169
doing on Twitter and Facebook

120
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,449
how they're exposing the company to
risks yeah there's a whole other side

121
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,500
that these kinds of risks from social
networking and I'm sure a lot of you've

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,680
already seen the things that people are
doing

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,789
consumers when they're frustrated with
companies I like to say

124
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,830
hell hath no fury like a web users
scorned oh man

125

Hewlett Packard were cut to an ITV

127

have tens of thousands people on your

128
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,279
