1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,020
some love you or your tower

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,529
right now I but we

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,150
need we need it this is a huge

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,620
public interest for our country and we
need the brass

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,270
best brains a that we can bring to bear

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,449
on meeting the challenges so

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:26,080
%uh in addition to consolidating within
the department single chain of command

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,510
we also I have a

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,489
for three important pieces are cyber
strategy

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,540
that fulfils are goes toward meeting

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,440
our mission the first is the continued

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,230
development feinstein as a critical tool
in protecting our federal civilian

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,230
agencies as you know the US computer

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,850
emergency readiness team us-cert as
where we consolidate our intrusion

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,210
detection incident analysis

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,100
and cyber response capabilities to
protect these

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,750
systems in the past year we've deployed
the second phase a

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,909
I it's time to 11 federal agencies we
will grow to twenty one by the end of

19
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:12,920
this year

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,500
and we have forward-deployed I N Stein

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,080
to to the poor management trusted
Internet Protocol Service Providers

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,540
this deployment in fact is ahead of
schedule

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,329
and it is allowing us to better identify
malicious cyber activity

24
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,079
and improve cybersecurity support across
the federal government

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,290
so now we're testing the technology for
the third phase

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,750
appliance time and intrusion prevention

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,890
system which will provide the Department
of Homeland Security

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,320
with the ability to automatically detect
malicious activity

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,659
and this able attempted intrusions
before

30
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,950
are is done to our critical networks

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,100
and systems let me a at a critical point

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,640
here even as we are working

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,250
in developing and deploying I'm stylized
91

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,819
I find to now I signed three week

35
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,360
take very seriously the protection of
privacy

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,690
civil rights and civil liberties so in
the cyber area

37
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,459
we have established an oversight and
compliance officer

38
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,700
I in to to work from the outset

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,069
on the technologies that we are seeking
to develop and deploy

40
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,430
and key US certain personnel

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,170
receive specific training on the
protection of privacy and other civil

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,910
liberties

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,300
as they were late to computer network
security activities

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,640
so even as we move to prevention

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,879
detection a on

46
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,519
malicious activity prevention preemption
in a way

47
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,280
we want to do it in an atmosphere that
respects those core

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,220
privacy values as well so that's why the
first

49
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,440
major major areas that we have
undertaken activities in his past your

50
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,500
second we're developing

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,370
the National cybersecurity incident
response plan

52
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,360
ensure up I which is being developed in

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,500
for collaboration with the private
sector

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,620
the ensure will allow us to Mel a
national

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,890
response to a significant cyber incident

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,500
a response where all aspects of our
society would have an important role to

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,260
play

58
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,640
from the federal government state and
local governments

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,549
to the private sector now much of the
government side have such a response

60
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,790
will be coordinated

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,760
I love the new national cybersecurity
and communications integration center

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,870
and kick are and we're looking forward

63
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,000
at the testing other plans I

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,049
that we are making with ensure been and
kick I

65
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,670
this fall in September when we will also
conduct the cyber storm

66
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,610
3 exercise again was full participation

67
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,519
up the private sector so as a secondary
the third area

68
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,810
I wanted to discusses that we have made
significant progress

69
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,800
are helping to secure the automated
control systems

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,790
that operate elements of our critical
infrastructure

71
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,139
now private industry owns and operates
the vast majority

72
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,880
on the nation's critical infrastructure
and cyber networks

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,810
so therefore we work very closely with
the private sector

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,009
to conduct vulnerability assessments on
six

75
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,169
commonly use control systems components

76
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,220
and networks we have then develop
training manuals

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,380
for workshops for conferences and for
other venues

78
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,199
to educate the control systems community
on the risk control systems cyber

79
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,389
attacks

80
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,620
as well as mitigation solutions

81
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,850
now since its inception the control
system security program has trained

82
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,110
fourteen thousand plus professionals

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,210
for both classroom and web-based
instruction

84
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,660
and we now conduct monthly cybersecurity
conference calls with the primary

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,110
manufacturers

86
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,900
of these control systems so bringing all
of us together

87
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,570
we establish the industrial control
systems cyber

88
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,310
emergency response team which is

89
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,330
really a national resource to recei

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,110
to managing to respond to incidents and
vulnerabilities

91
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,139
that affect our nation's control systems

92
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,620
and again nations control systems are
important

93
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,250
for protecting and securing the nation's
infrastructure

94
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,389
goes right to the heart the mission the
Department of Homeland Security

95
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,870
so these are key efforts already
underway

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,069
at DHS but as I've suggested

97
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:08,110
we need to do more am we need to do it
faster

98
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,190
so within the Department of Homeland
Security

99
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,810
we're committed to better aligning our
cybersecurity and physical

100
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,310
infrastructure protection

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,190
missions nearing together a strong
resiliency

102
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,960
component to make the Department a
clearer focal point for cybersecurity

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,509
with in the federal government our goal
of course is to be able to ensure the

104
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,240
continuity of government

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,569
and private sector services and
information

106
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,229
while protecting privacy but also
providing

107
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,729
the ability to bounce back even more
quickly should

108
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:48,289
a large-scale attacker really an attack
have any size

109
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,560
I a car a part of it is prevention

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,800
reaction prevention but also resiliency

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,830
around the nation now

112
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,900
it's important I think on to pause here
and say

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,060
that we are not about duplicating
capabilities that exist

114
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,300
elsewhere in the government we're past
the point

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,569
where stove pipes in the government make
any sense whatsoever when I fished old

116
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,500
pipes

117
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,560
what we mean is we're things are and
vertical corners like this

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,630
stove pipes but there's no wars all
connectivity than ever

119
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,080
reach out are they and they do not
organized to communicate talk plan

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
strategize

121
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,020
with each other I so within

122
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,110
this department by having all these
missions and strategies and one place we

123
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,979
are able

124
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,190
to break down those stovepipe said
existed

125
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,370
prior to this and bringing all national

126
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,240
capabilities to bear while we continue
to

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,419
organized and to build a the cyber

128
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,840
cybersecurity aspect of the civilian
side

129
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,610
are United States government on

130
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,740
you know last week the I was testifying
in the congress

131
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,190
before the Senate Appropriations
Committee

132
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,069
are and I described our efforts

133
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,229
I as really not being a a

134
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,050
a duplication or replication for what
the Department of Defense is talking

135
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,460
about doing

136
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,520
because I think in some respects we we
are much further along

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,639
but it's really a recognition the
massive effort we need to make on the

138
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,029
civilian private sector side

139
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,719
if we are truly going to exists in a
secure cyber environment

140
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,029
in this century so are we want to make
sure your

141
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,490
a and part of this now will go to Mb

142
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,930
I think discussed within the congress
but within the administration

143
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,430
with the congress are we want to ensure
and make sure

144
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,890
that the Department of Homeland Security
has the legal authorities and the

145
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,790
financial

146
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,769
resources we will need to execute our
mission

147
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:10,370
successfully and two attract maintain
and retain the top talent that we need

148
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,480
we're going to work with the private
sector to build resiliency here

149
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,700
I and we are going to be pushing forward

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,209
as I said as fast as we possibly can

151
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,670
let me let me turn to the human
dimension aspect

152
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,350
up this and get beyond kinda
governmental organization and

153
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,300
and kickin ensure but and all that let's
talk about the people

154
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,209
because be on the technological and
governmental side of cybersecurity

155
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:45,019
I can't stress enough that really a

156
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:48,800
a secure cyber environment is as much
about people

157
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,330
and habits and culture a as it is

158
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:58,230
about machines cuz even the most elegant
technological solution will ultimately

159
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,850
fail

160
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,100
up
