1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,179
ladies and gentleman please welcome

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,179
FBI director Robert s mother the third

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:19,070
and afternoon everyone

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm sorry about that between the marines
here because he had to stand up

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,009
they told me that they had music
introduce

6
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,000
the speaker by I said no you gotta be
kidding

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,340
they say what do you want and i'd
joshing Lee said well

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,989
the Marine Corps hymn hoping to up
spider

9
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,670
or two up push everybody back and lo and
behold

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,280
they did up I'm glad to be back in San
Francisco

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,660
and glad to be back talking to this
audience I can tell you I always like to

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,200
be

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,410
a little bit different and I'd venture
to say I'm probably the only person

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,710
in this room that is wearing a tie I may
well I

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,030
be the only person the room knows what I
is I

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,770
but as I say hey it's good to be back in
San Francisco

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,610
recently I read a new story

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,610
about a tailor in Bogota Colombia

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,610
a tailor who makes bulletproof menswear

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,390
he will design the garment to your
specifications

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,720
and line with Kevlar sufficient to stop
a bullet fired from a .38-caliber pistol

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,150
at point-blank

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,030
range some may question whether this is

24
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,290
necessary or extravagant or both but the
world has become increasingly dangerous

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,740
this man was merely combining the need

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,970
to stay safe with the desire to look
good

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,830
at the same time course my first thought

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,729
as well was for the brave but polish
volunteer who were these clothes during

29
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,240
the testing phase

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,820
my second thought over

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,100
however was that we could use this kind
of ingenuity

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,549
to safeguard are computer systems in the
early nineteen nineties we marveled at

33
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,189
the potential at the Internet

34
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:19,150
the risks seem to be a world away and
the dangers were largely limited

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,299
two teenage hackers and identity theft

36
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:26,269
but today the power and the
pervasiveness

37
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,849
on the internet are evident in the way
we communicate way we conduct business

38
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,709
no way we learn but the risks are no

39
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,340
longer a just that possibility they
write their doorstep and in some cases

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,810
they are already inside

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,029
the house and unlike the Colombian
Taylor we are not bulletproof

42
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:52,219
nor can we make ourselves so we can work
together

43
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,870
to align our networks with the
equivalent kevlar

44
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,859
and we can work together to find them to
stop those who are taking

45
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:03,400
shots at us and to prevent future
attacks

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,309
almost twenty years ago here in San
Francisco I read the book

47
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,859
entitled The Cuckoo's egg many have you

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,930
I'm sure know it two-story other by
Cliff stall

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,059
a Systems Manager at eight Berkeley
Laboratory he noticed an accounting

50
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,299
discrepancy

51
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,769
I've just 75 cents any ultimately track

52
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,529
track that describe the 28 German
espionage ring tapping into

53
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:36,949
our military networks met a story to
several FBI employees to illustrate the

54
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:37,639
Aleutian

55
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,089
cybercrime asked if anybody had read the
book

56
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:44,510
I one replied did Stick Micro

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,949
younger employees said with a but look
like a smirk

58
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:51,730
I haven't read it sir I was only 10 when
it was published

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,089
I responded thank you for reminding me
of how old I am

60
00:03:56,089 --> 00:04:03,089
I'm sure you'll be very happy in the
FBI's office in Yemen

61
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,870
coming around a large office agent
though it

62
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,500
agent though it may be the story

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,418
up this tall illustrates how far we have
come and how quickly

64
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:23,000
today we'll talk about what the FBI is
doing to investigate and prevent cyber

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,530
crime

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,270
talk about the power partnerships touch

67
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,220
a touch on what we must do together to
prevent cyber crime from becoming

68
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,990
endemic

69
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,430
to our businesses our economy and our
national

70
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,500
security as begin with cyber threats to
our national security

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,530
as you well know a cyberattack

72
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,729
could have the same impact as a
well-placed bop

73
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,620
today terrorists have not use the
internet to launch a full-scale

74
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,930
cyberattack

75
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,919
but they have executed numerous denial
of service attacks

76
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,150
near the face numerous web sites
including congress' website

77
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,380
following President Obama's State of the
Union speech

78
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,759
a group known as the Iranian cyber army

79
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,599
claimed responsibility for this attack
and while the damage may

80
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,760
have been limited such groups attack for

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,660
both publicity impact and becoming more
adept

82
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,139
at both in the past 10 years

83
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,610
al Qaeda's online presence has become

84
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,949
as potent as its physical presence
extremist are not limiting their use

85
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,520
the interment internet to recruitment a
radicalization they are using it to

86
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,180
incite

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,490
terrorism thousands of extremist website
promote violence to a ready

88
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,599
in the willing audience they're posting
videos on how to build

89
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,330
backpack bombs bioweapons and they are
using social networking

90
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,680
too late terrorist plotters and plants

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,760
Accorsi internet is not

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,110
only used to plan and execute attacks it
is a target

93
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,500
in another itself Osama bin Laden

94
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,639
long ago identified cyberspace as a
means to damage both our economy

95
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,080
inner psyche and countless extremists

96
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,400
have taken this to heart we in the FBI

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,430
along with our partners in the
intelligence community leave the cyber

98
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,200
terrorism threat Israel

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,400
and rapidly expanding terrorists have
shown

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,690
a clear interest in pursuing hacking
skills and they will either train their

101
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,580
own recruits

102
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,580
or higher outsiders with an eye toward

103
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,169
combining physical attacks with
cyberattacks

104
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,240
apart

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,070
apart from the terrorist threat
nation-states may use the internet

106
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,789
as a means attack for political ends
consider what took place in Estonian

107
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,830
2007 and in the republic of Georgia in
2008

108
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,940
wave after wave data requests

109
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,240
shut down banks an emergency phone lines

110
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,800
gas stations grocery stores even part

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,330
a beach countries government the impact
that these attacks

112
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,979
but this all aware of our
vulnerabilities

113
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,250
mister promoted to

114
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,580
counterintelligence intrusions and
economic espionage espionage want

115
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,919
pitted spy versus spy country

116
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,960
a against country but today our
adversaries said on

117
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,340
fiber-optic cables and WiFi networks

118
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,550
often unknown and under undetected

119
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,080
they may be nation state actors are
mercenaries

120
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,479
for higher rogue hackers are
transnational

121
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,849
criminal syndicates the attackers
actively target our government networks

122
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,229
AC car technology our intelligence

123
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,690
our intellectual property even our
military weapons

124
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,870
and strategies and in short they have
everything to gain

125
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,120
and we have a great deal to lose there
has been much discussion

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,380
%uh late about which nation-states pose
the greatest

127
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,860
danger a cyberattack to a certain extent

128
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,949
that discussion baby irrelevant may not
matter who the attacker is for whether

129
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:23,560
the Notre

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,599
motivation is political ideological

131
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,060
or financial the information may be
bought

132
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,300
and sold by anyone anywhere in the world

133
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,810
weather friend or follow and the end
result will be the same

134
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,079
we will lose our data we may well lose
access to our own information

135
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:49,370
and we mail may well lose our security

136
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,350
in recent years we have witnessed a new
trend the collection have seemingly

137
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,670
innocuous information

138
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,079
about a company and its employees from
email addresses

139
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,030
to PowerPoint presentations to note for
meetings

140
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,300
the state it not only provides inside
knowledge up research and development

141
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,689
business plans or quiet negotiations

142
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:17,100
it can provide entree to a company's
network

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,910
hackers are using this data to Spearfish
employees

144
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,189
sending emails purportedly from
coworkers

145
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,870
with content often to loring or
realistic

146
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,890
to ignore and just one reach

147
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,380
is all they need to open the floodgates

148
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,689
we'll see not only a loss of data but
also corruption and that they did

149
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:45,400
we as you were concerned with the
integrity of source code

150
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,800
if hackers made subtle undetected
changes to your code

151
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,270
they could have a permanent window into
everything you do

152
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,319
the same is true for those with access
to hardware and software

153
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,709
in the global supply chain
