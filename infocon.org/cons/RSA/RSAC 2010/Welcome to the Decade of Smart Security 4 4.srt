1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,480
is in this decade of smart will embrace

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,830

opportunities to innovate securely

00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,650
and cost-effectively however

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,699
you can't move to a paradigm like
smarter security by yourself

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,230
it's just too big a job need partners
who can help you get there

that will help us achieve strong
security

13
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,030
because I think the lessons of the
Rosetta Stone have taught us

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,340
I that and we've known this but
thousands have years

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,430
