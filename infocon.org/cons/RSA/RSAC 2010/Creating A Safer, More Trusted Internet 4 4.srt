1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,029
it in the clout knowing at this may give
not only their government but other

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:07,609
governments around the world access to
that data

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:10,820
because this cloud is gonna have data
centers all over the world

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,650
and governments will go to companies in
whatever country there n

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,000
and see data and so I have always
believed

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,580
that information technology should not
dictate social policy

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,720
you create the social policies you want

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,560
and then you align your technology this
will be a big issue

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,649
so let me close by saying that's really
important that everyone participate in

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:36,540
these debates

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,570
and in these issues we need people to

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,290
deploy robust identity solutions that a
good football security

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,539
and privacy start using the latest
products and technologies and get

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,170
involved

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,410
start thinking about how to innovate in
both the prevention

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,120
and response to the different kinds of
attacks that we see

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,480
on the Internet and start thinking about
how we can encourage governments to set

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,159
normative behavior is for

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,100
government activity on the Internet and
has think about

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,530
how consumers businesses and governments

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,040
have to manage the shared

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,950
and integrated resource have a great
conference thank you very much
