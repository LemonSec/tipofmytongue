1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,899
thinking differently about how we
approach securing the cloud now placed

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,350
us a security professionals

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,130
to regulators to the government and
ultimately more transparency

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,610
you are regulators our shareholders
expect us to be very transparent about

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,559
our operations

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,230
and it's going to be a real challenge
for cloud providers not

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,000
until they can provide similar
transparency for us going forward

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,070
so thank you sir

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,269
let's look now at from the security
vendor so what what what are the

10
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:27,119
challenges

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,849
and abortion is facing the security
vendor so

12
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,640
in fact the security vendors out 3

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
major herder to overcome one

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,190
it does to read June its technology so
that the country could be applicable to

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,780
the clout

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,030
which in itself is not something easy to
do the second thing is that it has

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,260
also to changes business mother the
customers that tomorrow will not be any

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,980
more the enterprise that would be more
the cloud computing vendor themselves

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,910
or the enterprises which are building
private clouds

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,080
and funny the the

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,320
existing security vendors will also have
to change tourney

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,210
is distribution channels because once
you beat something in the job

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,869
the cloud is the distribution channel
said and in fact these look at.

24
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,570
today order if your traditional added
value wreath there is a third row

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,729
which today I'm less and less and less
added value to do as the

26
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,420
cloud on the internet can deliver to you
extremely sophisticated application

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,939
right into your browser

28
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,759
no matter where you live so let's hear
from one

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,820
the three wanna be a pioneer of

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,100
in security a the CE the CEO of tryin

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,700
Eve action if we say

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,930
I keep it ninety is tonight the
invention opinion paper

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,159
cloud computing is allied invention up

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,130
printing technology you were unable
messa mom

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,140
of Neil known each creation

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,549
and Shari we see much more Asian Way

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,540
of using that processing power estar
each

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,790
but just like 3d technology

39
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,080
we don't proper copy protection cannot
for the benefit human being

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,770
that Kyle computing power cannot be

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,920
forty realized with proper new security
key

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,430
Pratt pics for this year's storage
ensure

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,629
infrastructure if he is a very exciting

44
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,360
yet challenging time or the security
specialist

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,870
and security bandit at Trend Micro

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,319
we believe it we should create a
security pact

47
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,970
beats security back feats injured today

48
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,550
and tomorrow's threat landscape iversia
change

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,209
customer environment and or sell most
important any

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,099
the new ecosystem eat I P industry
because now

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,750
let's look at the clock computer vendor
itself so of course for

52
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,580
for us cloud computing vendors it's
absolutely paramount

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,370
that would provide reliability
availability and that

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,440
with such a tease secure all good
caretakers a

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,800
as you to save the data for customers
after all this is not

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,420
Rd to that we manage or store is the
date of our customers

57
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,440
so we have to essentially put a very big
effort to build

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,849
the security into the infrastructure as
well as

59
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,620
ODI team that the security that were put
in place

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,750
is the proper security and as graded

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,280
told us a very well there's one thing
that I believe to competing vendors on

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,150
not doing

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,670
as well as we should is to be
significantly more transparent

64
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,220
you know the words that allowing you
know corporation which

65
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,319
in fact are essentially outsourcing

66
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,019
if you prefer third the dow all the care
their data to us

67
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,870
in return for these advantages that
cloud computing provide you

68
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,930
that we became significantly more
transparent now I'm a firm believer

69
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,069
that those who do not do that will not
survive

70
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,870
today there's something very unique with
cloud computing is because that the

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,930
internet brother

72
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,290
very few cloud computing company

73
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,759
which started like most diverse in 1999

74
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,900
disappeared because it's only the
company whether as a call reach dad

75
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,000
says four dot com we'll release on that
street with Larry Ellison

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,280
qualities with my own money

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,520
that could continue survive and continue
building the dream

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,960
but guess what today there is many many
many car companies

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,440
solutions coming out of the gate and one
is a very unique thing about to

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,970
computing is at once

81
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,310
you selected cloud computing vendor
you're much less

82
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,169
dependent have that cloud computing
vendors like renting a car I'd

83
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,240
AB's you can switch obviously there's
always switching cost

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,479
but you can switch which means I believe
competition is going to start to be

85
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,340
fears

86
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,580
and is going to force the cloud
computing vendors

87
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,460
to really provide better as the day is
and better transparency

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,750
so I spoke about the mound where

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,300
which is becoming house so sorry so

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,900
a let let's hear in fact now from

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,979
up from the sea ESO for

92
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,550
not quite a cloud computing vendors but
the company which really depends

93
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,669
on the cloud and the sister from the
largest

94
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,340
internet game company a needed

95
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,550
Bulma

96
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,699
cloud computing has been a buzzword for
the last two years

97
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,110
and would be have really seen in the
last six to eight months is

98
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,190
companies specifically executives

99
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,780
around the world businesses embracing it

100
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,930
embracing and because it enables like
now Arbor technology before

101
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,930
be in jeopardy ever reach and the
flexibility but modern companies need

102
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,389
today

103
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,080
the Cloud Security Alliance came to get
her because we wanted to help the vet

104
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,250
we want to embrace and new technology
actually a new way

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,139
to utilize and consume a new technology

106
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,030
and we did so because we understand and
it's important for us to be care

107
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,979
that embracing and new technologies down
so if security and privacy in mind

108
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,949
heading down we're touching over 200

109
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,810
million people around the world we
deliver fun entertainment

110
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,349
for eyes cloud computing is an enabler
about it

111
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:56,270
it would be pretty hard to do so we see
this as a crucial part our business

112
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,520
we have obviously an interest to make
the secure

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,990
to have privacy of our users in mind

114
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,039
and we work with vendors to do so

115
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,500
and to push them to do more and better

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,770
to think about security controls because
in the end

117
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,620
it helps all about us our customers
evander

118
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,330
and eyes I believe that

119
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,789
security in the future will become more
complex and our industry both feel this

120
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,199
complexity

121
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,380
cloud computing will SL a radar gun as
in our industry

122
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,370
but one's a jest and up new technologies

123
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,759
help make them better more secure of
pride

124
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,530
the ones that refuse was simply go away

125
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,449
we have to think about security as a
complex structure in the future

126
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,710
about users people what they do

127
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,680
wherever you go how they do it and who
make contact with

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,879
unless be truly think about this
complexity

129
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't think we really get ahead and
that's exactly what our industry needs

130
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,190
working together making things better
more secure for everyone

131
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,729
and getting ahead thank you do so

132
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,780
we we spoke in the beginning %uh the man
where becoming bended knee

133
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,800
Cinda the year all raw event

134
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,379
as teachers to you know can if a very
humbling lessons then

135
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,979
realizing that hundreds of companies you
know I'd be compromised

136
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,340
a so let's hear from wanna the

137
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,830
wanted the funder up a fervor up for
forensic company I think partners and

138
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,930
someone

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,550
who really spend a lot of time to try to
look

140
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,130
and not allies that entire alright
phenomena

141
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,110
up I liked stumbles

142
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,269
recent state-sponsored hacker attacks
have demonstrated too many businesses

143
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,120
they need defend themselves in a much
higher level than the expected

144
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,800
many commentators have said is the
achilles heel cloud computing

145
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,089
I don't think that's true but is true
that cloud computing

146
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,120
introduces new interested tech services

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,230
a number of the technology is a public
cloud computing is based

148
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,920
such as virtualization and she made a
file systems are generally

149
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,760
untested we don't totally understand the
implications abusing them in a cloud

150
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,279
computing environment

151
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,600
that being said cloud computing is an
actual opportunity

152
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
for your enterprise to rebuild its IT
systems from the ground up

153
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,990
with security and trustworthiness in
mind

154
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,070
this is especially true into response
when revamping your instant response

155
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,019
plan

156
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,560
make sure to contact your vendor that
you'll be able to access the meta-data

157
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,250
access logs an audit logs just as you
