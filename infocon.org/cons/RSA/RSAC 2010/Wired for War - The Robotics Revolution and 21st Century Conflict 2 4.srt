1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,500
all arm billions of dollars made in a
nanosecond on wall street. billions of

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,360
dollars lost in a nanosecond on austria
we see

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,940
changes in social relationships I can
friend

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,750
someone that I've never met before of
course the pentagon

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,600
may be worried if someone serving in the
military friend someone in China

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,990
using a pentagon computer we're seeing

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,449
changes in the law we see this tool
being very useful for everything from

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,300
DNA arm identity tracking to data mining

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,770
match in the show CSI without computers
but of course computers are leading to

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,180
new rebel attacks in terms of
criminality

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,329
match in explaining to your grandparents
identity theft and what exactly that is

12
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,809
the point here is that again it's these
ripple effects that make something

13
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:52,480
notable

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,910
the final parallel that people make i
think is an instructive one

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,920
they say it's a lot like the atomic bomb

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,930
that is an incredibly cutting-edge

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,760
even elegant technology but also a genie
that you can't put back in the box

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,010
the underlying point here is that

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,220
we often want to focus on the technology
itself

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,009
when its its report backs on society on
war on politics on business on law

21
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,500
the truly matter now I'm someone who is
interested in the war

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,920
aspects to this and so several years ago
I set out on a journey

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
basically to gather the stories have
anyone

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,259
and everyone working in the fields a
robotics and work today

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,210
so what's it like to design a robot
what's it like for the science fiction

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,490
authors who are advising the military on
what to build

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,590
what's it like to be in nineteen year
old sitting in Nevada

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,470
flying a plane that's over Afghanistan
what's it like to be the four-star

29
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,140
generals

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,979
and Commander what about the politicians
so interviewed every single civilian

31
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,270
service secretary

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,729
Alyssa back when and where we go to war
the opposite side

33
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,689
quite what do insurgents think about are
robots

34
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,700
what do they think about you and me
sending robots out to fight wharf ideas

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,628
Howard journalist covering this not just
in the US but journalists in places like

36
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,770
lebanon approx

37
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,069
and finally the right and wrong about
this what a military job officers think

38
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:17,989
about what's happening

39
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,750
but also what about people places like
Human Rights Watch and so

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,520
in essence the stories are fascinating
but also important

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,840
I think they illustrate these report
backs the calm of missus what I'd like

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,459
to do

43
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,379
my many times basically walk you through
he's ripple effect that I think are

44
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,040
interesting and particularly relevant

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,400
to our field here now the first to these
is your scene

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,099
is that the robotic revolution

47
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,250
is not just going to be an American
Revolution

48
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,420
there is a rule in both technology

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,099
and war there's no such thing as a
permanent

50
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,790
first-mover advantage so quick show of
hands here

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,050
how many people in this room still use
your comment or computer

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,420
I many have ever used a comet or
computer

53
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,260
okay we got some same thing plays out

54
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,360
and war the British invented the tank

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,090
germans figured out how to use the tank
better and so a challenge

56
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,750
is that the United States is very much
ahead and military robotics right now

57
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,300
but we shouldn't be air gun about it

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,560
there's forty three other nations out
there that are building buying and using

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,920
military box

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,409
nations like Russia China Pakistan Iran
as well

61
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,930
as allied nations like great britain for
your work

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,940
this raises certain challenges in terms
of the cross between

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,310
intellectual property and
counterintelligence that is

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,310
if this is a field that is critical to
American national security

65
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,470
then we will see attempts at stealing

66
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,150
information and everything from design
but also how you actually

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,989
interfere with everything from designed
operation and we're already starting to

68
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,000
see notes about

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,480
on two good examples 1 is a robotics
company

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,730
that a couple years ago went to the
Singapore Armed show

71
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,129
where they solve a clone a one up there
robots

72
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,530
being displayed for sale another

73
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,630
manufacturer describe how they have five
different dedicated cyberwar campaigns

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,530
against them right now

75
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,780
now in many cases we are our own worst
enemies here

76
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,860
you may have heard about the recent news
that insurgents

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,220
were actually watching the video feed

78
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,889
that Predator drones and other drones
were sending down in Iraq

79
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,810
and this came out of three things the
first was the unexpected growth this

80
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,699
technology

81
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,280
going from using 0 to seven thousand in
a couple years

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,930
and because it this we have a mishmash
up software

83
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,780
some other proprietary summer but not
the second aspect

84
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,020
is that the new about the flaws they
knew that this could be tapped into

85
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,430
as far back as 2000 but we
underestimated the pace of technology

86
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,229
so what would took very sophisticated
technology to do in 2000

87
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,660
to watch this video feed by 2009

88
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,990
required a thirty dollar piece of
software that you could download off the

89
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,699
internet

90
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,530
it was software that was designed
essentially for college kids to

91
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,130
illegally download movies

92
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,560
and then the third part our own
arrogance again we knew

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,180
about the vulnerability going back to
2000 but as one defense official put it

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,310
we didn't think anyone in the Middle
East could figure it out

95
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,449
now the point here is that this is not

96
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,509
huge risk in terms of people taking over

97
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,860
controls up the Predators but it was
useful to them it was a lot like being

98
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,259
able to listen in on a police radio
scanner

99
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,800
they were getting information that we
didn't want others to have

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,750
but what this illustrates is where we
are headed down the road

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,220
that is as we utilize more and more
systems that are digitally controlled

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,520
don't have people inside them we move
from

103
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,580
battles just up destruction

104
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,169
into battles love disruption jamming

105
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:06,639
too liberally clogging the band with and
even persuasion

106
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,770
where the intent is to seize control of
the system and make it do something that

107
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,699
the owner and operator doesn't want it
to do

108
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,419
that is to coop and persuaded things
like

109
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,490
Rico all-american tanks as enemy tanks

110
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,000
or change the GPS coordinates where you
gonna send not

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,889
on Jay damn ball but there's something
broader here to think about

112
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,100
in terms of the global situation

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,039
where does the state American
manufacturing

114
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,060
where to stay love science and
mathematics training in our schools have

115
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,250
was headed in this revolution

116
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,419
what does it mean to be sending out more
and more soldiers

117
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,919
with hardware that's made in China

118
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
and software it's increasing written in
India

119
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,949
or to put it more broadly what does it
mean for american national security

120
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,169
when the number love students with
degrees

121
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,590
and I T in engineering is the same
number

122
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,970
as we were producing in 1986 but since
1986

123
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,770
the number of students with degrees and
parks recreation and leisure studies

124
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,289
has gone up by five hundred percent what
does that mean for us

125
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,289
what does it mean that we are one of the
few high-tech nations that doesn't have

126
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,349
a robotic strategy one other interviews
I did was up the US air force officer

127
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,759
stationed in Japan and his role is to
basically keep a track of global

128
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,410
technology trends particularly an
unmanned systems

129
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,069
this is what he had to say quote the
Chinese are kicking our butts while we

130
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,000
sat on our thoughts

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,699
but you can't just focus on States

132
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,060
just like is what happened in software
warfare is going

133
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,599
open source that is this technology is
not like an aircraft carrier

134
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,819
atomic bomb where you need a massive
industrial structure not just to buy it

135
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,580
but even to use it

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,789
lot of the technologies commercial
off-the-shelf

137
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,800
summer but even do it yourself the
editor of Wired magazine for example

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
built his own version of The Raven drawn
at hand tossed drone

139
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,470
the SOL the soldier using in Iraq and
Afghanistan

140
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,319
built his own version for a thousand
dollars

141
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,849
a particular area concerned then is the
cross between

142
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,349
this technology that is in essence
flattening and proliferating

143
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,780
and the realm of terrorism for example
during the war between

144
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,220
hezbollah and Israel you had a non-state
actor

145
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,680
versus stay but it didn't stop that
non-state actor from being able to fly

146
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,860
for unmanned drones back at Israel or we
had another incident

147
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,180
love a-arm radical website

148
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,279
that offered users the capability

149
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,630
%uh remotely detonating an IED iraq

150
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,950
from the comfort of their own home in
where we're headed soon

151
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,570
is again advancing in this technology so
for example

152
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,959
roadside bombs are not always going to
stay in mobile by the road

153
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,500
they will be able to get up and move I
one example this

154
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,040
is on iraq a team US soldiers

155
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,930
saw skate more rolling out them one of
them very observant we noticed the

156
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,190
skateboard was rolling in the opposite
direction

157
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,089
love the wet basically they turned the
state skateboard into a mobile ID

158
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,560
there is a ap for your iPhone

159
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,170
that actually allows users to control a
drone

160
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,459
that can carry a couple pounds worth the
payload

161
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,950
and again it's not just gonna be kids
think this is core to operate as well

162
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,160
and this leads to three trends I think
we need to keep our eye on

163
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,220
the first is that it reinforces the
empowerment individuals and small groups

164
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,430
against the state

165
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,050
i member during an interview with a
scientist for darpa

166
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,589
said that quote for fifty thousand
dollars I could shut Manhattan down

167
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,740
right now

168
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,790
the second is
