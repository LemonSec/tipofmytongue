Dave Carroll music dot com if you wanna

appreciate was on my flight here today
whole I see okay well man dude

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,009
so that's what you can get it again
imagine if you're the person in charge

20
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,890
branding and and

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,350
again eight million people watched that
video that several million dollars

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,700
people worth love I'm all traffic just
like that that's the kind of thing so

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,130
that's how to control

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,880
the social media space is I think this
is a great balancing act

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,710
for consumers who feel like they've got
a beef they can use it but

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,850
your if you working for a company that's
the challenge you know that's

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,020
commensurate because

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,159
it seems like one of those emergent
properties

29
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,850
yes this new technology that you may not
have anticipated

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,440
if you're a company like it do your and
HR man

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,780
or year and customer service or
marketing

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,979
that a seriously bad weekend man notes
in his head

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,530
thing tips a million and watch it became
reprise I got my sweats pouring down

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,509
your face how do I respond to this and

35
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,240
and I think there's a lot of parallels
between this kinda response in the kinda

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,909
responses

37
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,789
folks here often worried about how do we
deal with consumers who have to make

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,359
choices and do they make good choices
are bad choices so

39
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,509
I just published his book stop getting
ripped off axle and book by the way

40
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,649
thank you very much thank you and New
York Times bestseller

41
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,780
yeah first week people are very worried
about getting ripped off nowadays okay

42
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,450
and I had a good or bad sign

43
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,489
well very it's a very intense topic into
the second half of the book is how to

44
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:18,890
not get ripped off for the first half

45
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,109
ask the question why are Americans so
vulnerable

46
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,390
why do we get ripped off so much and I
know you all know the answer where

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,420
stupid lazy

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,739
speak for yourself every

49
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,079
I there's I saw that are out right i
mean and i actually at and them

50
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,459
I'm not kidding I there's a lot of
government research about this I

51
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,609
I have all sorts and statistics on this
in the book but just as an example the

52
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:41,700
gay people a quiz

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,109
essentially could you add to menu items
up

54
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,540
and figure out how much the total would
be in what way to 10 percent tip be

55
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,680
okay fifty-eight percent of Americans
were incapable

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,859
%uh adding two numbers and multiplying
by 10 percent she serious man

57
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:00,130
any to menstruate it like a bike got a
99 cent

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,180
fries at McDonald's and then a six piece
Nuggets

59
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,600
yeah it's a percent people can could not
answer the question thing about the last

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,979
time you ate lunch with four friends the
bill comes

61
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,079
what happens they wait and hope some the
aspects it and Wheless Lane

62
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,329
with my iPhone ticket later at I which
yell

63
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,790
and then and everyone pulls out a twenty
dollar bill throws it on the table in

64
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,079
hopes the waitress figures it out now
you take that person put them in a seat

65
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,190
at a car dealership

66
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,130
word from a mortgage broker now stand a
chance and that's

67
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,100
that's the world that we live in two
there's actually a small field of study

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,440
called in numeracy

69
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,780
which is basically mathematical
illiteracy which is looking at this

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,650
problem which i think is really a hidden
epidemic in America

71
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,479
a people don't know the basics now we
can apply in this not knowing the basics

72
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,380
to computer security as well

73
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,060
yeah we are asking more and more people
to make intelligent choices about how

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,209
they use Facebook

75
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,259
how they decide on passwords how the how
are they allowed the gadget to

76
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,169
communicate and

77
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:01,459
and they're under qualified well hand
those choices I think are becoming

78
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,410
increasingly complex

79
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,009
if you've ever had to manage your
privacy settings on

80
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,540
a lot in the social networking site it's
not clear to the average person

81
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,060
you me I live and breathe this stuff man
and I gotta say what I really mean

82
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,259
then I finally got it right only change
the settings so you have to go back and

83
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,070
make sure yeah

84
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,020
that's right after a liar actin so I
mean I think this is something we all

85
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,310
really need to think about II

86
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,710
I know and and I always get laughter
when I say we're lazy and done because

87
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,680
obviously

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,470
that's true we are lazy and dumb in this
room would have room for the experts who

89
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,169
know about computer security who think
about privacy to like like you do

90
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,560
and there's a room full of people who
don't

91
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,860
is that there's a world full of people
who don't I don't know what the

92
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,910
percentage would be but it's probably
one percent

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,000
ninety-nine percent and i'd like for
everybody in the room to think about the

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
fact that while you're the expert in
this area

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,160
and there that the freshman at the
family the friends are gathered I

96
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,190
notes that packs a poor right the idiots
sexi

97
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,600
million I'm already there I bet if I
turned to another topic like

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,750
planning for retirement changing the oil
in your car going to the dentist

99
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,640
that next return and Italy rest the last
time that I went to my dentist

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,530
he's got you know how many times you've
lost a while I know when I can remember

101
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,280
and he just looks at me with this
scornful look

102
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,110
and I'm look and IT guy had last time he
said to change a password

103
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,670
that's right are the same look I may
have given somebody when they said

104
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,760
I got this great E-coli did Mike I

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,460
double clicked on the axing and I what
are you doing there at the world is so

106
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,270
full a people are demanding to us how
could you not

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,389
got your teeth clean how could you not
have change oil how could you not have

108
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,920
taken care of your privacy settings

109
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,440
what is so I I can see what your sayin
terms that searches

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,560
and even know if I'd call it sympathy
but understanding where the you have to

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,480
come from because they're not an expert
in this area

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,560
but it's still we're moving more and
more towards a time where users

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,850
have to make good security choices it's
important for the ecosystems you mention

114
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,970
mortgages

115
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,480
yeah I so if people can add to menu
items I would say that it's very

116
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,660
difficult to Sir

117
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,590
filter through a mortgage agreement to
make the choice is up buying houses and

118
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,560
we all know

119
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,950
that our country our world economy was
put to the very brink

120
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,690
largely because a bad mortgage Choice's
now again we can all say well there

121
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,280
they're dumb that's their fault but also
to data shows

122
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,520
if you live in a house this on a street
where there is house foreclosed

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,590
your house loses one to two percent of
its value

124
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,490
every 50 houses in your neighborhood in
your town that loses value

125
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,970
your home loses about 10 percent of its
value so just like in security where

126
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,290
my Security Council on yours and count
on you is we're all in this together

127
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,120
it's also true that these other economic
issues when someone else makes a bad

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,139
economic decision that affects you too

129
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,510
with some hope over pays for housing
your neighborhood neighborhood you wanna

130
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,210
live in

131
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,680
that means you have to overpay to get
here a good school so

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,210
if I can leave the folks here with any
peace but I should trying to be a little

133
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,900
more understanding

134
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,440
with when folks new younger folks are
less sophisticated than you

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,430
Ted Williams a big baseball fan is a
classic example of someone what

136
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,000
as a great hitter terrible coach you
know how to do things is often very very

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,440
hard to teach other people

138
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,480
because you know it so well try to keep
that in mind we interact I want to bring

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,450
our next guest into this conversation so
this is a guy that

140
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,810
incredibly in touch with the customer
every time that I've sent him an email

141
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,970
scare early I've gotten a response and

142
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,120
at maximum I think as I have actually
been timing this

143
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,850
under a minute I would really incredible
given him an email that he must get

144
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,270
and he really needs no introduction am
sure many have you have used Craigslist

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,389
over the years to buy and sell things
I'd like to welcome the founder of

146
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,560
Craigslist

147
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,030
Craig Newmark size

148
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,810
welcome

149
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,220
have received

150
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,940
in who's entering your email right now I
am and I'm kinda worried

151
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,550
i'm a i'm doing right now it

152
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,820
actually i about forty-five minutes
behind this customer service

153
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,080
but that probably won't cause much panic

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,470
Maggie you know outlaw

155
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,400
dead at how quickly that I i've been
getting emails from me and I've heard

156
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,130
the same reports from other people out
there

157
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,310
and have also seen is kinda

158
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,690
evolution in Craigslist over the last
couple years

159
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,710
in how you inform customers arrests so
whenever i buy something now you know i

160
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,780
buy a big-screen TV

161
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,780
i'm looking for an apartment and this
big red notification across a prime Tina

162
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,350
don't accept credit cards from people
you're what made you guys

163
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,960
hip and make that decision

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,890
that we want to push this message at two
years I what was a back in conversation

165
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,190
that led to those customer notifications
it's basically a matter of listening to

166
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,810
people

167
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,520
and do I make sense underlying that is
the notion that

168
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,750
you want to treat people like you wanna
be treated so we put up a short

169
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,510
respect for message the deal is that we
want to get the

170
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,840
information out there people need while
not making it so longer legalistic

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,000
that no one will ever read it what you
we've been talking a little bit about

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,950
people making choices and making good
security choices

173
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,910
so I live in New York and whenever I
walk down a street

174
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,450
I know signals have a bad neighborhood I
see graffiti on the side of the wall

175
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,870
here gunshot

176
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,990
and I know this is not somewhere I want
to be right now and again the camera get

177
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,590
outta there as quickly as possible

178
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:58,400
and their the signals that I've grown to
understand and no just through life

179
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,370
experience

180
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,760
and I'm
