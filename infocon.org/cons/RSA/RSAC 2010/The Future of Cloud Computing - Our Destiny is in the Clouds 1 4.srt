1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,949
good afternoon it's a real pleasure to
be with you today that thank you for

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:04,610
coming

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,269
so before a we start discussing about
how

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,940
cloud computing a is changing security
as we know it may be

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,439
let's go back to a few RC sure recall
the days when

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,340
it was about the said defending network

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,580
it was about large companies

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,140
which will govern up all of these point
solutions to provide

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,410
can afford one shop word would be
significantly

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,550
is your to go to to secure our networks
it was the day where

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,660
worms and a hikers where

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,750
roaming happily out there

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,360
if we just one year back

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,860
that was the year where almost every
security company s an entry by them

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,899
by the magic of marketing become a sauce
company

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,899
everybody wanted to be

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,490
cloud computing the security
professionals were

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,360
pretty leary because obviously seventy
thinking that the data that we

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,470
spend so much time and energy to protect
was now moving into the cloud

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,619
was indeed frightening we also so

21
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:25,950
virtualization new technology coming out
and we could see

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,430
a matter where starting to

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,240
raise its ugly head and at that time
also within wanted to have to do

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,939
anything with social networks

25
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,860
because we knew that that was a very
dangerous place

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,579
so let's look at where we are today

27
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,850
the theme far as said today

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,340
is cloud computing becoming

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,850
rear and in a bid to burn

30
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,280
it's about matter where I have been
become a century pandemic

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,680
we social networking whether we like it
or not we're all doing it

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,170
and we have seen

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,020
doubt Arthur is significant
participation above the government

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,110
with our new cybersecurity czar

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,420
with the director the if the I'm

36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,420
Janet Napolitano and contributing
significantly

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,150
you know did you the discussion so that

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,080
there's ice that something as really
change

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,620
and this is what we're going to talk
about so then meet

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,120
go back gain a little bit a year ago for
those who

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,120
assist the I doubt talk I discuss about
the inconvenient truth of security which

42
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,750
today we know exactly what it is the
fact that

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,390
securing on that work has become harder
their neighbor

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,170
if not impossible and

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,900
obviously that we know now as I discuss
a year ago that

46
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,250
drug computing is extremely is very as a
very disruptive nature

47
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,900
in itself which you know many whiskers
is or so

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,180
room since then i thought id been more
about the disruption

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,330
and what I realize is that in fact its
even more powerful than I thought biko's

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,980
it reminded me if we go back few hundred
million years ago

51
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,290
to the Cambrian period where we so the
explosion of life

52
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,470
and we saw the exposure of a fly because
there was

53
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,519
enough building blocks of life that this

54
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,530
started to be on themselves and creating

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,840
very very different ecosystems competing
against the

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,090
each other's so across technology is
concerned this is exactly what is

57
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,709
happening

58
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,170
technologies building on his on itself
faster and faster and faster and faster

59
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,299
and there's plenty of examples that that

60
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,650
in June 2003 as I'm sure you all recall

61
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,349
the Apple Computer the iPhone was now
most

62
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,989
banded poo-poo d that you can if a
gadget

63
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,610
three years later where more than 100000

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,049
ap on that device on which is really a
platform

65
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,930
and these applications are changing our
very lives

66
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,020
and even the way we do business and
three years ago

67
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,830
bukar and operator were good friends

68
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,870
essentially trying to for

69
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,030
pushback Microsoft together

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,139
now today they are competing

71
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,340
in a battle which is very reminiscent of

72
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,620
the upper and micro sim batter

73
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,259
the up in platform versus the more
clothes

74
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,550
platform and then few weeks ago

75
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,639
a we had that new announcement

76
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,750
the iPad and again same story all over
again

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,330
the banded pooh-poohing doesn't have
these doesn't have that this is

78
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,690
that's a troll the reasons why this is
not going to work

79
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,669
but when you start to think about it
that device

80
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,150
leveraging a lot of technologies which
has made now that devised possible as

81
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,860
well as the

82
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,460
delivery mechanism that I judy's

83
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,110
seventy I believe is going to change
again

84
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,770
our lives especially the live the
executives

85
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,020
as well as the life of my you three
years old

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,050
lil girl why

87
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,210
because as an executive seventy with
that

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,250
device I can read the newspapers

89
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,990
I can read my books I can do some email

90
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,000
again just some notes as you know
executive

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
done that very productive we just
consume information

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,100
sometime we do something about it so

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,330
and my little girl she's already and I
touch

94
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,639
fine and she finds that the the the
keyboard is too small

95
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,169
you know the so she's going to be

96
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,280
delighted when a giver

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,740
and iPad which I can because it's only
£5.95

98
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,819
so would you think that a man dove 65
years old would share the same

99
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,750
technology that the three years old

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,660
your arm so that's the world we are in

101
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,860
so we've got to be ready for the change
and that change is becoming almost

102
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,509
unpredictable so this is where we are

103
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,150
whether we like it or not so

104
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,560
I discuss obviously about our that
phenomena which is got computing and

105
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,520
cloud computing is nothing more

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,560
then the Internet due into the I pick
industry

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,110
and two the security industry in
particular

108
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,000
what he has already done for the
publishing industry

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,180
this is all these internet biz
technology

110
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,750
coming at disrupting the way we do
business

111
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,610
so I discuss a year ago about the fact
that unique opportunity that cloud

112
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,090
computing was giving us a security
professionals biko's

113
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,440
it gives us the opportunity to build the

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,569
the security E do the very fabric of
cloud computing

115
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,370
today the problem we all obvious that we
have to secure his enterprise network

116
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,240
which means corporation f2

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,620
by the infrastructure via the servers
the database is installed them by the

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,970
application integrated application and
then

119
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,020
with the security on the BB which is
obviously becoming absolutely impossible

120
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,030
to do

121
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,580
so we have that opportunity to
essentially put our minds together

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,400
and really do the right things and beat
security into the fabric

123
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,490
of for computing so

124
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,110
obviously this present different
challenges in an opportunity and

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,819
we're going to look at one by one by

126
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,379
taking some segments what's the chance
for their of cooperation to do that

127
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,770
obviously the corporation are facing
fight with a billion with the most

128
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,020
difficult problem

129
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,270
because on one hand large proportion St
to continue maintaining the security of

130
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,629
the current computer infrastructure

131
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,810
and they have also to start you know to
move into the cloud and learning that

132
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,349
new

133
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,849
and varmint which obviously present a
certain number of challenges

134
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,070
so let's hear from the

135
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,760
the CSU 12 the largest global companies

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,870
I'm very happy to up

137
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,419
the sea is rough G grady summers no
which countries speak about his abortion

138
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,940
issues and challenges the moving into
the cloud

139
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,430
edgy were enthusiastic about the cloud
for the reasons you might expect like

140
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,850
the scale we like the

141
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,019
flexible provisioning of course like the
financials about what we like the most

142
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,089
is where the innovation we love the fact
that cloud provider can take all that

143
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,310
scale and leverage it toward a single
application or single

144
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,750
infrastructure platform really
innovative much faster pace than any

145
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,529
large or small company could on their
own

146
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,820
I we see a lot of opportunity for GE
companies like us we've we've had some

147
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,610
good success with

148
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,630
with storage in the cloud in backing up
to the cloud some good success stories

149
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,500
with security services in the cloud

150
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm as well but we think most at the the
big opportunities are going to be an

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,100
applications as a service you know the
CRM

152
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,360
the personal productivity applications
in latex and moving those haps to the

153
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
cloud

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,540
that said we've got a real challenge
with security and compliance and privacy

155
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,190
on you know ironically many things you
love the most about the cloud

156
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,640
I make accounting from compliance
perspective we love that bass recycle

157
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,250
but on the other hand were bound by
regulations are required to document in

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,430
and test every release extensively

159
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,570
I love the fact their users can access
data from anywhere in the world on any

160
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,070
device but if the cloud provider can
tell us

161
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,959
aware that date is sitting or sure is
that was duly able we tried to delete it

162
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,870
that's going to be a problem so
ultimately I think this
