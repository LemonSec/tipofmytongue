1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,189
coppersmith and others came in with
comments like that calming the flurry

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,540
never got happy again it wasn't that big
a deal the attack did not work

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,980
as specified at that time very argues

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,059
the

5
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,779
that makes you think a little bit let's
go back

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,840
and review the process again remember
that

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,060
session the first 15 giving their talks
in from dying in laying on the floor

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,070
had demanded came up with the BF attack

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,840
later on Randolph then in the room on
that day and stood up and said I have an

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,400
attack

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,579
have these huge array a linear equations
each term representing quadratics me a

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,780
este looks after

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,020
and i can tell it all down in Bangor got
your variable you're dead

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
I believe rendell would have been dead
laying on the floor along with others

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,570
and would not have gone to the final
five would not have emerged as the

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,000
winner

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,640
and I do believe it was the most
performance in widely acceptable and

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,410
performing

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,010
process in that part we would have lost
a good thing

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,320
that a process fall because a black

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
of time to verify for their technical
verification of claims made in a public

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,330
session

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,920
alright just kinda cool off a little bit

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,159
as: had the great for being the women
had time to cool a because it's too

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,710
frightening to throw it away

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,439
so they finally be down the BF attacking
it survived we have really the key

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,130
attacking talked about now I D way they
did mention that require related keys

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,520
was real question where you get those

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
get a megastar nevermind and

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,220
but duke it out an experiment with
taking him back and get ahead ed Rendell

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,869
there's another twist to it as well as
well as having a possibly detrimental

32
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,470
the concern on the second quarter round

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,530
she had a had his favorite way to be
brief

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,030
well that first when buyers of Africa
scary enough

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,729
but a go back to their first-round again
and look at the other candidates that

36
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,869
were disqualified are known to be dead

37
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,659
to some of them deserve a resurrection
was a possible they were shot with

38
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,270
blanks

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,469
the way ABS almost worked who is another
favorite could be examined on the

40
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,270
process to the lie in their graves

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,020
with respect or should they be
resurrected already

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,140
that left on the end of stuff and I
think I did what would be the

43
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,060
implication for the shuffling
competition %uh

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,590
as well to save my time here but lied
about the nope this do that now

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,730
the SHA three is running thank you and
happy said very much

46
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,840
on making

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,830
hash codes in my mind and I think most
of the audience is much harder

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,010
than making a codebook okay we got

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,220
then another reason he s was a fun thing
to do because it's pretty easy we should

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,900
have a winner

51
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,050
I'm not convinced we're going to have a
winner with the hash function a contest

52
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,220
running how do you make sure

53
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,220
you do good processes to do that it
started with fifty-some-odd thirty-some

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,150
I can do this that and the 15 now

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,180
I believe the process is to run for a
while looking at those in the mouth

56
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,950
a winner I think the field is too large
still I think they should pick

57
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,160
three winners not one as semifinalists

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,769
alright and run another one to two years
looking at those intensely

59
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,290
to really make sure another work has
been done for a wise decision

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,280
and not risk the hearty are foolish
consequence overlooking something

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,099
to seoul for the study has been done ID
like slot for study

62
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,890
thirteen years Amaury a little stories
about that we can't wait that long

63
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,340
but it needs more than the currently I
recommend extending the shop process

64
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,349
begin 31 is not one and studying longer
before announcing the final winner

65
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,940
the cave has pulled out there the
problems but they're far more robust now

66
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,950
to last longer for that process

67
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,989
than the AF process they have had to run
fast cuz theres

68
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,360
that was already dead in fact you should
replace many years before

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,030
apologies for that we can not make that
mistake again

70
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,099
if times are free to do it more safely
thank you

71
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,849
thank you just add something to what I
said you come in every day and work on

72
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,909
it impossible problem in about every 180
have a good idea

73
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:54,569
cool but a fall would be excited on day
one hundred after days 1 $3.99

74
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,810
produce nothing I mean cuz initially the
eighth and probably work on a day when

75
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,260
100 looks no different

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,319
from the others and that's something
that every meant at

77
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,620
that it's important to get excited about
that

78
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,730
10th or 100 idea even though it's
foolish to do it we have no chance of a

79
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,239
tactic so this looks like all the others
white light

80
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,350
why try it and you'll never get anywhere
K

81
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,130
wilhite like to take advantage of the
present so far special guest here

82
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,210
ask them pointed question I'm sure the
audience's

83
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,979
burning to ask you all kinds of things
like go when it is that the NSA

84
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,380
managed to break the RCA algorithm at
that quantum computer in the basement is

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,810
coming along

86
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,300
adamant uninstall the eavesdropping
software in our iPhones and so on and so

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,729
forth

88
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,100
but I I'm going to refrain from those
questions let me ask something a little

89
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,790
tamer

90
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:49,790
thank you mother is so please

91
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,470
so some years ago it was certainly the
case that the

92
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,690
Cryptologic know-how in the NSA
surpassed that in the academic community

93
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,889
to what extent do you feel that that's
the same case to what extent can you

94
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,590
comment on whether that's

95
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,590
the case today it's a more nuanced

96
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,009
last year you have to take a look at the
range of things and if he is interested

97
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,500
in and the Rangers thing

98
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,250
commercial sector is interested and they
do not have the identical

99
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,020
overlap as a prince that we care about
that you don't have a range that we care

100
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,130
about that you don't

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,789
things we care about nuclear command
control I don't think you care and want

102
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:25,849
to play in that area

103
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,720
okay things that we don't care much
about but that you are very interested

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,190
and

105
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,759
there are some and I really shouldn't
because then if they never confesses

106
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,819
were not interested in from the
cryptographic that many terms that

107
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,120
are not as thrilling for us lower
forgive me

108
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,310
of them their own knowledge doesn't will
be able to get has

109
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,610
if more value in peer to peer Mitchell
suspicion relationships among suspicions

110
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,240
partners

111
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,169
military systems are credit roll top
down the general says they were shut up

112
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:52,680
girl

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,070
you don't negotiate back and forth so we
have less interest

114
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,620
in some areas and you may be better off
in those areas that famous for your good

115
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,130
but let's take a look at the area were
you both overlap and we both have

116
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,349
something at stake

117
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:10,060
what's going on there we cheat we get to
read what you publish and you love to

118
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,680
publish it gets you academic prestige in
that promise

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,240
we do not publish what we study shame on
us

120
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,419
joking you know national security

121
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,940
we have to maintain but it is an
advantage this pragmatic it's there it's

122
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,500
real

123
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,099
class we have a very good budget a very
aggressive very talented staff 102

124
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,729
mathematicians PHD's

125
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,110
on stair doing nothing but good quality
that's a nice

126
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,340
Department those most universities can
you know

127
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,870
afford that in their schools so
unnecessarily I think we're going to

128
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,460
have some advantages here and they're
not as a give us a better

129
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,780
actual knowledge base more stuff then
you had

130
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,419
I think if you take a the way to do it
is not the best

131
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,979
how to compute that metric so let's go
to on various different specific field

132
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,500
and I can do this in detail

133
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,199
but each little piece that we might
overlap on there are so many different

134
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,490
people in Britain research papers and
stuff

135
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,500
measure in each case who's ahead plus
and minus course by some

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,830
manner and did a weighted average over
all of them come out with that number

137
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,479
to see who has the most they can on
average by defining averaging function

138
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,449
I do believe the NSA is still ahead but
not by much

139
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,680
small him to love years on average some

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,930
dramatically so others narrowly so
possibly even behind you in that pool

141
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,639
but on average due to resource intense
the admission and focus

142
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,310
I'm going to have the extreme hubris
adding him politely say

143
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,009
I think we got the age still but I do
believe that in the eighties it was a

144
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:39,759
huge gap

145
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,089
you guys picked all the cheap inlet
low-lying fruit real quick got

146
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,669
grown-up real fast and I got closer and
closer and tighter so the

147
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,710
exponential curve coming up but I think
will always be on a curve slightly

148
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,110
ranting and we're very close together
and both of us are moving slowly in a

149
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,370
fairly mature feel

150
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,110
so I can be a tighter race over the
years and sort of urgent met each other

151
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,460
shows method

152
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,120
so it makes no sense for me to issue

153
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,889
VAD Lee differing opinions in this and
the foolish in England do it anyway

154
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,800
a at first time this part A that I don't
think nuclear command and control is a

155
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,539
particularly good example something

156
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,050
that doesn't interest %uh the public I

157
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,930
the public about the first happen some
papers on that subject some up in

158
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,419
question outside an essay but inside the
government

159
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,460
I inspired by Gus Simmons which anyone
who's working on nuclear command and

160
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:30,990
control

161
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,680
I don't think that's outta bounds what
use outta bounds because

162
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,899
is there are a whole range up problems
that are inspired

163
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,570
by doing real signals intelligence

164
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,630
and you really this community can't do
that

165
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,630
the minor point almost irrelevant point
is that

166
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,310
you know would be illegal but generally
for us to do that a more significant

167
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,680
barriers the

168
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,690
expensive but the critical point years

169
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,020
it really would be unbounded leave
frustrating to attempt to do so signals

170
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,020
all real offense Eve work

171
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,819
in public if every time you reading
their traffic

172
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:13,990
you go publish a paper and rub their
noses in it they'll do something about

173
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,290
it

174
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,880
I and she'll work because you know will
you think I these workers frustrating

175
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,270
up that's what they worry about down to
Fort Meade you know we'll go

176
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,449
blows some source and then a bunch of
people have to work hard to several

177
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:27,990
years

178
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,160
to recover it and so that is the portion
the work

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,209
and when you're doing production
cryptanalysis

180
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,449
you are never satisfied with the results
I

181
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,709
you'd like to do it on the basis of less
traffic in the Pleasance a higher noise

182
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,579
get the results out quicker spend less
on the computers

183
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,779
no he into practical issues you have a
product that product is going off to

184
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:52,670
your bosses

185
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,040
were effectively paying you for and you
have to sharpen it up just as much as

186
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,220
you possibly can

187
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,990
a brief pushback I'm not
