1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,490
good morning well here at the RC
conference we get an opportunity

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,059
once a year to come together as an
industry and spend a little bit I'm

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:09,880
talking about

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,170
what are the challenges that we face
today and how our jobs

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,320
in our industry to change over the next
several years

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,470
where things that we see is an
information

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,869
is continuing to grow at a very rapid
rate every minute

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,960
every hour every day industry announces
place back growth

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,810
at sixty percent per year and I talk to
customers who tell me

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,820
its 15 percent and I've had some tell me
it as much as a hundred percent growth

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,380
per year

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,469
but this information is no longer

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,690
sitting in a filing cabinet or file on
your desk

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,489
it's now on your cell phone your laptop
your netbook

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,570
is being accessed from everywhere from
your home

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,949
from Beach from a chairlift at your
favorite ski resort

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,859
or an airplane is flying across the
country this year 2010

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,600
marks the beginning the decade that
we'll see enormous change

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,310
but we've got to do is take a much
closer look

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,540
and information where'd you come from
what do we do with it

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,009
how do we manage it and really what does
it mean

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,530
to all of us this decade will define

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,049
what we call the information economy
it's an economy

24
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,570
is defined by the value of intellectual
property it's defined by the value

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,159
content it's defined by the value of
ideas

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,530
its all about the value of information
what makes digital information so

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,670
powerful though

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,720
is they can be created very easily it
can be distributed

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,600
it can be replicated it can moved from
place to place

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,920
but that same flexibility is what
creates

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,950
the real risk what we've done

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,619
is we need to think about how do we
protect that information

33
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,899
from the moment created to the moment
it's toward to the moment it's accessed

34
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,880
how do we manage it and security as the
information economy

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,310
continues to change what are the things
that we need to think about

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,930
is where the major trends they're going
to dominating forces

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,840
in this new economy we've talked a lot
about cloud computing

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,069
mobile devices in social media we
believe that these are forces still

39
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,670
absolutely change I T when I think
that's happening right now

40
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,300
is that as people think those trends
what we know

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,470
is that they're absolutely inextricably
linked

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,160
more the computing power is moving from
my desk tops on our servers in our data

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,739
centers

44
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,410
out onto the cloud that power is fueling
digital devices

45
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,160
because it providing greater access
applications

46
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,670
and information from wherever you are
the thing that's driving this though

47
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,180
is ultimately the underlying ubiquitous

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,069
connectivity that we all now have access
to first

49
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,670
let's talk about the growing trend we
all know as cloud computing

50
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,959
there many facets to this trend

51
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,459
first you've got public clouds got
private clouds and you've got a hybrid

52
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,379
you got many layers you gots offers a
service

53
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,940
you got infrastructure as a service and
you've got Platform as a Service

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,970
these are benefits both to the IT
organization but also

55
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,680
to the end users cloud computing is not
pose a major shift

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,489
in how services are delivered by it.

57
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,930
ill challenge our traditional thinking
will move us from a service provider

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,720
model is based on our own IT department
to service providers external

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,980
and it'll change the relationship
between that service provider and the

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,959
service consumer

61
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,140
now this relationship hinges

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,489
on trust it hinges on the confidence and
trust between

63
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:01,450
the service provider and the service
consumer despite the real benefits that

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,319
we see

65
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,450
there's also concerns about privacy and
security

66
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,260
security is ultimately the key to
enabling trust

67
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,780
that will make this model succeed

68
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,759
as you think about some the key issues
those who can successfully address

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,930
security

70
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,600
compliance and privacy will be the big
winners

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,500
not talk about how we as an industry can
do that

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,290
but first let's talk about the growth in
digital devices

73
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,400
when I think it's interesting is that
we're seeing a big growth

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,880
in devices that are non windows-based
we're seeing growth in devices like

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,860
iPhones

76
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,050
Android devices blackberries you readers

77
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,639
in just a few other things that we're
seeing come up on the horizon

78
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
but what we see is a change that we
haven't seen

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,290
as dramatic a change in as many as
twenty years

80
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,470
from the inception up the PC

81
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,580
as we think about what's happening
consumers are driving the adoption of

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,669
these devices

83
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,639
they're asking us to basically at except
those devices

84
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,110
and allow them to access corporate
information from wherever they are

85
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,660
i DC predicts that the B-one billion

86
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,840
cell phones accessing the Internet by
the end of this year

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,610
to put that in perspective today their
1.3

88
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,940
billion PCs accessing the Internet

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,949
like many view I carry multiple devices
right now I'm not exactly sure mine

90
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:32,550
isn't sure just in his RC soles
wondering

91
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,520
where the heck is that because the head
device

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,020
has all the information that we use

93
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,750
as our company I can access the Internet
I can access our corporate data I can

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,289
access our customer data

95
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,259
and so we need to think about how do we
secure that device

96
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,650
now these trends are absolutely
transforming industry

97
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,729
cloud computing social media and mobile
devices

98
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,780
and so I'd like to do now is I'd like to
bite mark many of the CEO Salesforce dot

99
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,660
com

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,569
to share his perspective heat today has
over 70,000 customers

101
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,039
at Salesforce dot com and they're
clearly recognized as the leader

102
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,590
enterprise cloud computing

103
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,370
bank

104
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,240
a and like to say let everyone at the
artist a conference

105
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,680
and thank you very much for giving me an
opportunity to

106
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,970
greet you today you know I was just
thinking that this weekend you may have

107
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,150
seen I wrote about it on at Tech Crunch

108
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,060
that when I started sales force that
common

109
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,100
the mid 90's I ask myself a simple
question

110
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,240
why is all enterprise software

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,320
not like Amazon dot com just seem to me
that

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,530
amazon dot com was just so easy to get
going then

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,800
such a robust application but that if we
made in our price offer like enough

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
amazon dot com well that it would be
low-cost it would be

115
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,380
easy to use and about the speed that you
would get compared to traditional

116
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,650
client-server

117
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,150
would be amazing that's why I quit my
job at Oracle in 1999

118
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,940
and I decided to start Salesforce as I
want to make all in our price: offers

119
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,090
easy as the Amazon

120
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,039
and behold now we have a such a
tremendous

121
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,280
industry of software as a service
applications as a service

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,260
even platforms as a service but just
this weekend I was thinking to myself

123
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,370
and maybe you had the same experience
why

124
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,360
why is all at a price of we're not like
Facebook I mean that seems like it has

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,789
become the new compelling application on
the Internet today

126
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,610
almost half a billion users in a
dramatic growth rate

127
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,430
when you look at the core fundamentals
are the internet usage for people are

128
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,410
spending their time on the internet

129
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,500
Sun Facebook it's on YouTube and it's on
fundamental search

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,210
and that's a big shift that's going on
from

131
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,610
just a few years ago people are on very
different services

132
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,620
but the power of this idea

133
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,380
is that the world is not just becoming
the cloud it's going social

134
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,229
and this powerful new metaphors their
increase productivity

135
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,150
make things much easier to use and even
lower cost

136
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,110
so this whole idea of cloud and social

137
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,300
and this idea also that everything is
going into the mobile Internet

138
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,890
how many people in the audience have an
iPhone how many people have a blackberry

139
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,060
how many people have an Android device
okay that's probably everyone in the

140
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,570
audience

141
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,209
the Arts a conference another question
that I

142
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,700
they can just have to look at is what
are we gonna let go the past

143
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,490
and 10 a.m. start creating a compelling
future for enterprise software

144
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,089
at the end of the day Lotus Notes

145
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,209
was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was
mean it's time for a change

146
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,800
and I think the advance man is a nod
from the consumer internet once again

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,110
and advancement in the next generation a
better price software

148
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,589
and that's why this week we're so
excited that we put Salesforce Chatter

149
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,110
in debate a and we believe in this new
vision

150
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,750
we believe in the imperative Avenue

151
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,820
enterprise industry we call it Facebook
comparative

152
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,480
and you can see our vision at WWW dot
Salesforce dot com

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,459
slashed chatter thanks in re K and have
a great conference
