1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,540
one other things that again or you run
the identity proof been in governance

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,839
business for axiom

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,410
very interesting business that you have
I am now

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,480
when I it might spirit specially running
Nike and then

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,299
now being a software vendor is that a
lot of the on-premise

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,930
security sales opportunities are
absolutely driven from compliance

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,449
initiatives there are declining to
things like that

8
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,300
so when you now you look at a different
delivery model

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,820
and people are procuring this stuff
different are you seen

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,059
that compliance an Rhys

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,930
are still the primary driver for people
procuring a solutions

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,410
yes and the other but complains
definitely drive security

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,559
the other major think we're hearing from
customers is how are you gonna protect

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,550
my digital

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,629
I'm intellectual property and my
applications

16
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,340
so you know in they offline world it
used to be well here some software

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,989
downloading here's a key great

18
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,059
well if I put it up in the cloud and I
have one person take it in Cherry 10

19
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:58,649
people

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,770
there's a fear that I'm gonna have my
electoral property stolen

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,000
so how can use identity solutions when
people aren't present

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,880
or two random verifications love like we
did in the old road and mainframes

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,820
to say who's on it shouldn't be on it so
they are compliances

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,290
and so protect my information my
intellectual property

25
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,229
and make sure I'm in compliance those
are the major thing to hear from from

26
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:20,770
customers

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,100
right you guys concur on that is that
what you see is well curtly

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,509
is that a driver for a lot of people
looking to go

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,329
to a managed service offering with you
verses try to do something and house

30
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,170
so we're provider cloud services was
consumer yeah it's what we see is

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,390
is that no one thousand say the day
doesn't go over a friends Hamza

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,500
when cloud is gonna do everything for
everyone right

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,310
to as you start to grab his applications
today and you have more identity

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,079
then you have your data from different
occasions different levels compliance

35
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,409
with its

36
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,920
at 10 today right our date it's probably
not gonna get a public cloud but it's

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,460
something that

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,520
can mean a public value may be the most
laps cations that such lies identity

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,750
crossed all that and tracking it is one
of those hurdles at

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,549
doesn't seem too bad we have one cloud
provider right but the ability to do

41
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,040
that multiply mention it

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,379
things are become more and more
important up times interesting yes now

43
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,610
Stephen Owen we leverage a lot of
different service in the cloud linked to

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,560
my development team it's your today's
been experimenting by

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,099
provisioning servers in the cloud for a
degree in management software

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,870
and be able to leverage quick its I was
amazed by the ability in the speeding

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,180
provision server

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,440
are in the cloud in them being able to
pull data from

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
the on-premise offerings and then being
able correlation in the sky

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,650
everything just it's amazing now
standard seems to come up whenever and

51
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,260
new technology evolution it starts to
occur

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,000
this standard work comes up a lot and
we've talked about this before but they

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,290
what is leisure thinking on that it in
what is the

54
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,310
importance standards in this new world
because there's so many different things

55
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,920
out there are people gonna start doing
in the cloud so

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,890
Leah which is thinking their city up I
guess who are you got that right that

57
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,440
TCP IP HTTP in HD lol 3.0 ever done

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,930
okay with it express I I'm

59
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,200
it I think in many cases day

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,450
people who ask questions like that a

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,010
are thinking in the back of their mind
okay I have this work loaded I've been

62
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,190
doing it in-house I want to move it into

63
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,599
some cloud that's scary here's a
mechanism for moving into the cloud

64
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,260
a and then I decide I don't like that
anymore I wanna go to a different cloud

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,370
vendor so I need some mechanism for
moving that

66
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,629
out have that cloud in and in into
another one it

67
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,030
at the same time in in some cases and
all this in here have been

68
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,540
involved in either producing or
consuming technology and we understand

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,310
that

70
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,549
that the the pace innovation is

71
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,180
never going to slow down one of the
things that attracted me to

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,390
Amazon to work for Amazon Web Services
was

73
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,840
the this that the the sheer rate
innovation

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,330
in the organization Ryan Howard rapid
new products and features are just

75
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,629
coming out that an extremely exciting
thing to be working on

76
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:13,310
and you have to balance that that desire
to innovate

77
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,100
for what customers want as well as what
they might not have thought verses

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,009
how would know what to stand going to do
is it going to hobble innovation is that

79
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,509
gonna

80
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,790
make games actually a little bit more
difficult to do that

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,560
so my view if this I guess probably I'm
speaking a lil bit more personal than

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,500
anything else

83
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,000
is that as long as there's an easy leap
documented mechanism for moving data in

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,430
and from moving data out that's what
solves the

85
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,970
release was going to solve the problem
on I'm not a fan of laughin

86
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,100
if somebody loves Amazon great use as
much as you want

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,310
but if you decide you need to move on to
something else then as long as as a

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,880
mechanism for easily Excel training that

89
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,550
and moving on to another one I think
that sufficient a slim

90
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,610
did you hear anything in your survey
results larry that standards mention at

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,169
all in

92
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,060
in the results again I mean we basically
see the this state the S word standards

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,070
I standards basically plight it just
about every aspect of security

94
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,740
here in the cloud computing it the
domain and I disagree with

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,620
I agree completely with steve is that
you there's a lot of innovation that

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,160
still

97
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,520
needs to be done and if you basically
lock into a set of standards too early

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,729
you could actually diminish innovation
so

99
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,259
we have to be careful because he is a
new domain right and i wanna make it as

100
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,080
efficient and effective in his positive
experience with possible

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,300
but we also need to think about the
security issues the arse

102
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,740
generally accepted standards said
basically transfer very nicely

103
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,590
to the cloud domain but I also agree
that over time as it becomes more mature

104
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,130
will

105
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,100
only desi standards but maybe now is not
the right time paredo

106
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,600
speed is where the people are after and
and taking advantage of these troops

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,210
quickly and

108
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,650
it'll be interesting to see a year from
now on we will have seen panels will see

109
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,280
I'll

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,000
that debate comes out with standards as
a lot of different bodies like the Cloud

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,270
Security Alliance in a lot of different
groups order

112
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,259
the helping drive thought leadership on
this and I think it's a it's gonna be a

113
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,580
lot

114
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,690
parallel going on with life all the
people doing that

115
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,900
providing the services if I come common
all that

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,970
see that totally agree with their point
that yes the easy in

117
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,460
is you know not as much as the centers
are really important

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,710
yeah rip you know I speak a lot on this
topic with different customers and we're

119
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,210
doing a threat model

120
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,020
you know the risk is if it's a a a
provider went away

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,560
right right right had you may get that
while you have it easy in easy out so

122
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,289
that becomes extremely important so when
when you're analyzing power providers

123
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,600
I would worry more about the easy in
easy out then whether

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,250
if it's a specific standard right angry
comply I agree as well cuz I think that

125
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,819
where we're gonna see is see I was gonna
want to be able to evaluate a multiple

126
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,810
different vendors doing similar things
and they won't be able to move their

127
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,199
workload and they're going to want to be
negotiated for those types the services

128
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:56,789
so

129
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,000
on speed and ability to enter and exit I
i think is going to be when the key

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,580
drivers on that and

131
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,220
had just as have something a sec ago arm

132
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,440
I was E at another conference a few
weeks ago

133
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,740
and one of the presenters gave an
example of how

134
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,110
with the existing technology now I'm

135
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,370
he weighs said were just perform some
raw

136
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,380
compute and storage on Amazon's Cloud
yeah

137
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,759
would move that over to Asher force a

138
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,110
some table analysis in the Asher tables
which would then move to Salesforce dot

139
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,160
com for

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,870
processing and finally was displayed on
a Facebook page

141
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,630
although it already I mean we're already
starting to see integration

142
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,870
ugh I love all of the clouds out there
now

143
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,919
and 10 and largely it happens because we
have

144
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,930
PTPA should be an HTML yeah

145
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,300
standard again yeah so Larry

146
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,900
woody in Sydney Roosters is it point out
would

147
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,129
you think might be the security services
that

148
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,940
people will be looking for for secure
damning in just listening and

149
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,720
to end the folks in our audience said
intending this conference in other

150
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,840
conferences

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,970
it seems that the issues around access
governance identity and vindication

152
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,000
on Federation things said

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,520
basically help you too determined
whether someone is a legitimate

154
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,789
or not a legitimate player ever the
player could be an end user could be an

155
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:23,879
organization

156
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,690
I think it to me that is probably gonna
be the most important areas have secure

157
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,060
again other issues to transfer or a
reason security thing to transfer like

158
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,709
for example election and and encryption
is probably gonna be just as important

159
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,519
right on you know I'm not sure maybe
some deal P will transfer maybe it'll be

160
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,089
new technologies

161
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,870
but it seems like a the issues mostly
around

162
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,970
authentication identity on

163
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,060
and and probably access governance but
generally

164
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,290
excellent well you know the identity
guru down there

165
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,019
and apparently that that is that a fair
statement like you guys are obviously

166
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,560
you have a service today so

167
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,010
I think it is but that's why we're so
focused on identity is it because it's

168
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,810
evolving

169
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,390
and he whether its mobile or adjust the
traditional way we've done it

170
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,450
I i think when hinted to have people
think

171
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,490
what the proper way to think about
identity it when people aren't present

172
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,290
and its not

173
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,709
doesn't have to do so much with the
technical architecture its

174
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,660
is Steve jammers him Steve when I'm
trying to commit fraud or

175
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,410
do a bad thing or really misrepresent
myself

176
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,510
on and I think it to continue the
evolving

177
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,089
thing and we've we studied different
paradigm to

178
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,670
identity and where are the touching part
points where we think we can capture

179
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,350
with

180
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,519
consumer's consent the intent up which
they they're acting and

181
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,670
it's a fascinating area but I i do agree
I think

182
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,230
of federated authentication is something
we'll see here right at

183
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,990
definitely in the next year on and you
know where you can authenticate

184
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,880
or verify the accuracy of data that was
provided to you in real time up in the

185
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,529
cloud

186
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,890
right let's I we see the same things as
