1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,889
virtual machine administrators who are
plain all the rules above

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,320
network storage and server
administrators simultaneously

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,410
this convergence a role Springs new
challenges

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,750
will need to rethink policies and
related processes for handoffs between

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,970
security and operations teams one
responsible for governing the

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,630
information infrastructure

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,090
the other insures quality of service

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,059
let's hear more now on the topic
virtualization

9
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:37,210
from Palmer its VMware oh I'm

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,480
over its CEO at VMware IT organizations

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,520
under pressure do three things: at the
same time

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,550
they're under pressure to increase
efficiency

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,079
to become more agile and to increase
security

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,079
of the data center we think

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,930
virtualization is you too achieving all
three of these goals

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,000
in fact virtualization is what allows IT
organizations

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,450
to achieve those goals in an
evolutionary where

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,479
so the work that were jointly doing
today here

19
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,890
is very important if we're to make

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,270
the private cloud up more secure

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,270
we really have to work together is an
industry we have to make sure they're

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,610
that for sterol technological
cooperation happens

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,850
to ensure that security is built into
the fabric

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,630
it means that we have to integrate our
prospective technological solutions

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,560
we have to change processes it's going
to be much more important

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,950
in the future for security providers to
be able to provide

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,340
real time information directly into the
data center

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,240
and we have to address the role of
people it's going to have to become

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,570
a much easier task for the various
people have responsibilities for the

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,790
various aspects of the infrastructure
and security to work together in a

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,380
common

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,850
administrative model but happy to say
they're working

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,060
very closely with our colleagues at Rs a
teacher allow this to happen

34
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,340
and it should take the form of new
products

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,489
that ship from both VMware and from our
essay

36
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,810
in 2010 so we have a

37
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,500
very ambitious agenda ahead of us but we
think it speaks to you

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,920
those three fundamental needs to improve

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,690
efficiency agility and security thank
you

40
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,010
thanks paul

41
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,190
virtualization is the engine and the
cloud

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,810
that will propel us forward not in one
sudden

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,930
Janet Leigh but rather as a journey that

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,030
organizations will take at their own
pace realizing

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,519
tangible benefits at every step along
the way

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,690
and by embedding security

47
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,870
in the virtual layer we get

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,810
our do over we can enforce policies for

49
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,569
information identity and infrastructure
within

50
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,209
this virtual layer as a result we can
shift

51
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,220
from infrastructure to information
centric policy

52
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,269
concentrating on what is most important

53
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,739
information and who gets access

54
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,120
rather than on out meaningless perimeter

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,709
or mere plumbing we see

56
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,379
4 well defined stages on this journey

57
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,030
the journey begins with virtualization

58
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,340
up non mission-critical infrastructure
like

59
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,860
test and development systems as well as
lower-risk

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,780
applications according to VMware
statistics

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,420
about 25 percent have servers are
virtualized today

62
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,310
and many of your organization's are well
into this phase now

63
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,680
given the non-critical nature

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,400
on the applications there are relatively
few new security requirements

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,060
at this initial phase but its in this
stage

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,849
that you will become adept with the
tools a virtualization and begin the

67
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,110
process

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,030
up hardening the virtual infrastructure

69
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,060
in the second stage organizations

70
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,780
virtualized critical business
applications

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,320
here your infrastructure becomes far
more scaleable

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,979
an elastic in your security requirements
will scale

73
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,310
in proportion you leave the same level
of visibility for compliance

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,060
in this virtual environment that you had
in the physical

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,580
but here insider risk increases in
importance

76
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,669
because as the portability a virtual
machines

77
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,509
and its at this point that will want to
push

78
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,210
security down the stack deep

79
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,970
in the virtual layer in bedding controls

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,729
that today are bolted on to the physical

81
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,060
infrastructure in the third stage the
journey

82
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,580
the enterprise begins to develop
internal clouds

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,580
and operate since information
infrastructure

84
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,780
as a utility this stage consists of a
fully virtualized

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,660
an automated data center where
application workloads

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,820
our policy and service-level dreaded

87
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,820
now the enterprise must have far more
mature process ease

88
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,880
for governance risk and compliance

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,220
GRC that can span the physical

90
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,470
and virtual infrastructures and because
of that convergence some roles I spoke

91
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,380
up earlier

92
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,389
server administration network that
senator

93
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,870
monitoring and controlling privileged
access

94
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,860
becomes increasingly important

95
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,020
additionally self-service and self
provisioning

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,479
add new layers of complexity self
monitoring and controlling changes here

97
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,729
will also be critical

98
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,800
in the fourth stage things get really
interesting

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,130
enterprises starter outsource their
infrastructures

100
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,190
to external service providers hybrid
clouds if you will

101
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,419
putt she won't want any part of that
unless service providers can't

102
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,160
demonstrate their ability

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
to effectively enforce policy prove
compliance

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,889
and manage multi-tenancy

105
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,220
at this stage Federation me comes

106
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,340
important capability organizations will
need

107
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,039
the ability to dictate and federate

108
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,090
identity and policy to their service
providers

109
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,120
so information can be handled and
accessed

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,470
appropriately next

111
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,910
they'll need you to demand that cloud
providers deliver

112
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,020
strong proof of compliance even in the
deepest levels

113
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,400
above the cloud service providers

114
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,759
should be able to tell compliance
officers and auditors

115
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,139
just about anything they need to know

116
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,160
with verifiable metrics

117
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,650
the ultimate goal is to generate a
concise summary and relevant events

118
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,099
occurring in the infrastructure that
feeds directly into a GRC dashboard

119
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:32,990
that visualizes the state of compliance
in real time

120
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,139
the last element in this flood stage is
how the multi-tenant

121
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,810
environment is managed this is probably
the toughest part

122
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,849
because service providers must defend
against call mingling the sensitive data

123
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,889
a multiple tenants to achieve isolation

124
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,900
requires controlling the flow of
information between the tenants

125
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,430
to do this we will need to create pulls
up

126
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,580
trusted resources or results

127
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,080
these trust in zones will be directly
managed by the virtual

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,830
infrastructure that ensures the
enforcement a information policy

129
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,720
within and between these zones

130
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,440
but sometimes you just don't want the
same

131
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,590
to tennis on the same physical

132
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,990
machine for example I can imagine coke
would ever want

133
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,660
their virtual machines on the same
hardware

134
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,810
as pepsi's so to achieve this

135
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,039
will require innovative thinking on how
we in essence

136
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,219
reconnect the physical to the virtual
world

137
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,740
this can be accomplished by leveraging a
hardware route up trust at the ship

138
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,410
level

139
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,769
that verifies virtual machines are
running

140
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,330
on the right hardware systems

141
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,720
hardware roots have trust could also
then be leveraged to create trusted

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,050
polls I'm systems with similar security

143
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,600
profiles or compliance requirements that
can then be dynamically

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,330
allocated to optimize workloads

145
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,500
this trusted polls of cloud resources
really become

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,170
the best up both worlds they provide the
fluidity

147
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,480
and flexibility of the cloud with the
assurance

148
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,230
a predictable proven security controls

149
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,820
and processes

150
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,080
this capability to achieve visibility to
infrastructure

151
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,760
as a Service assure

152
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,760
the security posture on that service

153
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,000
trust the resulting measurements

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,300
and prove compliance is not

155
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,870
just theoretical this morning

156
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,930
arce an ounce a collaboration and proof
of Khan
