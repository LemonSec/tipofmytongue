1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,380
under control are we closer not remember
I always couple implementation in my

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,310
mind with

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,940
the theory work necessary to get there a
list not divorcing does

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,490
in that and the money we spent to make
sure that the products cannot be

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,490
penetrated

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,119
is very aggressive new and a controller
me know

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,510
and the holes we take on the missile
shield in the rest at it I don't think

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,199
commercial sector plays I think that
toys that you don't hear

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,900
there and Rd you have a actually again
once I tractors for them

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,809
you know I'm getting too friendly with
iron idea what then if they

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,210
you bullying but they've well data point
which look like you'll use

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,950
a few years ago about the NSA
declassified

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,670
response the freedom of information ok
with I

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,210
day title of all day our papers
published in the intimal

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,949
technical journal top-secret technical
Joanna a

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,270
the papers themselves were not published
only the titles head billy goat believe

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,780
they are hundreds of titles

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,780
in this mall all the way up to nineteen
eighty flee

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,670
and if I like to remind everyone before
the bout

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,340
six or seven years after the invention a
public key cryptography

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,630
I didn't say a single paper published in
the internal technical juvenile

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,450
of the NSA which even mention public key
cryptography

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,150
in its taking so indeed a demonstration
that the NSA

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,340
was way behind in public key
cryptography at least that time well

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,860
people who invent things in parallel
don't necessarily use the same

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,909
terminology

27
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,680
know I might not have been a completely
I do live in fear i okay

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,960
on night this is a dancer dance before
I'm tired

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,220
I al Qaeda I actually know the answer to
that question but

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,420
at bit better than this the NSA
technical journals a very funny object

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,159
its name suggests is like the Bell
System technical journal

32
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,939
but it isn't at all because the Bell
System journalism created

33
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,640
as part of something called the
Kingsbury agreement the required as an

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
anti-monopoly measure

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
the bell system to tell people what it
was doing that is not

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,479
all the intention to dance a technical
journal it is purely a device

37
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,330
for internal motivation the real
literature and an essay as departmental

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,209
reports

39
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,209
and then technical journal and its
successor the crib logic quarterly

40
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,940
what all things for punching you know
like forgetting tenure

41
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,160
it's good feel promotion to publish sons
and technical general

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
I do not believe here here what I'm
confident I love

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,550
you know I can the next they can't be I
do not think it accurately represents

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,730
the importance of work in the agency
there are two papers on public-key

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,280
later in the late eighties in the end in
the grip logic orderly

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,390
a one about outside world

47
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,610
and one about some key management issue
that turn on

48
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,180
over to look at in studies and again a
in in the agency

49
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,480
the tech a Journal didn't cover all the
literature uniformly cuz main

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,610
compartment in areas internal well the

51
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,879
having another rising thing years that
on balance

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
up CommSec is less sensitive than
Sagan's so

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,310
the rather scarce number of papers on

54
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,739
you know route variety of sorts of
systems you don't find represented their

55
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,730
that was to me surprising because I
thought those groups would have

56
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,170
published

57
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,230
more internally the Prime Minister
mental decay

58
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,349
give us another question but well

59
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,209
we have for just enough time at this
point for some closing statement

60
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,840
any thoughts on the discussion today and
the notable omissions and

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,840
your view with which you like a stone
now I see the balance of my time I'll

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,390
have outbursts as time goes on interrupt
up

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,310
for the this is the wrap up around then
last around

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,940
yeah so up the only thing I would add
and maybe even a comment on it into

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,569
interview your last question about an
essay in the act

66
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,799
in the open literature it seemed to me

67
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,319
that the advances in breaking

68
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,000
hash functions came heavily from the
open community even though

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,840
there had been reviewed by an essay so
how does that figure into it up at this

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,480
if someone has time to answer that

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,680
it were to join LinkedIn earlier

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,989
I mean it seems to me in fact evidence
that that's an area in which the two

73
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,810
communities

74
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,859
on not miles apart a stick that the move
what are the differences between the two

75
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,330
communities with one area where

76
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,840
Inessa certainly is orders a major
difference is building systems admin

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,889
the academic community we get a group
with researchers together a factor as

78
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,240
these

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,949
768 the amount of resources the use of
that is

80
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,050
large by academic standards but piddling
by compared to what as they come out on

81
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,790
this and building

82
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,100
Arctic large systems to to attack
occurred

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,460
only problem getting large data sets
together larger version

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,970
order to attack a problem is this
something academic community just cannot

85
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,120
to address all I accepted theory which
which

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,139
you really did you get your hands dirty
with a lot of these problems to do so

87
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,740
up other final say that like US
generically for

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,350
things I think the imports a platform
security is is with us I think I've said

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,780
that before anything

90
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,039
movie 22 the phone is as a universal
proxy

91
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,690
the electronic representative for you
make sure these phones are secure

92
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,820
is critically important browser security
be secure the crystallography

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,190
listeners ideal cloud world where you
know Alice has a key etc

94
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,860
separate and so on and that's just not
worry are you with with the platforms we

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,320
need to be able to

96
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,610
I instantiate that ideal framework of
parties who can

97
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,810
keep secret to use them securely with
will hardware/software systems that the

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,870
Trillium

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,490
weakening South Wales actives we're a
long ways to do that this is getting

100
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,850
critical

101
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,229
but this morning we had I'll the into
the Arctic talked about cloud computing

102
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,910
and want to gain I have to our them the
parade I am not picky with the party

103
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,610
and you see that the big elephant in the
room that no one is talking much about

104
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,530
these

105
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,340
government intervention in all of the
af2

106
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,130
I remember that the elephant fish their
knees are

107
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,430
by click Hewlett has lots of our
technologies billion but then

108
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,130
there is some picked by which is coming
out the back office so far

109
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,440
AT&T from from fiscal I

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,750
phone exchange going all the way to the
NSA

111
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,810
so I think that dying I

112
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,319
well saw most people will move the are

113
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,620
airport IT operations into the cloud it
is going to be the with Bloomberg

114
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,490
Government

115
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,960
and I think

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,199
you you just have to you just have to
remember here

117
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,400
the story of kato et je I you remember

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,009
company ritual sending a large fraction
of they are

119
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,169
a cryptographic devices field world
countries

120
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,349
and I don't doubt 2br form the

121
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,639
company able then if they indeed German
equivalent

122
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,069
and our if rock in the future we are
going to RC

123
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,500
I doesn't doesn't so far companies
offering cloud services

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,979
please don't use cloud AG filled with
that

125
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,729
well I'm not found at the cloud either

126
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,940
frankly you're renting an interface and

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,060
you only get the innovation don't know
what else is cuddling up to it going

128
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,830
into your pockets I to think

129
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,069
you have to writer contract very
carefully at least a month

130
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,250
the service level agreements otherwise
you are great risk

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,729
and that ties and also the that the last
thing I want to talk with you

132
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,500
cybercrime and other malicious attacks
occurring at an increasing rate

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,840
and they are more subtle across more
technology sectors

134
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,259
remember we had a credit derivatives
problem

135
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,120
that caused a meltdown in the current
recession because it was

136
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,150
a complex instrument not fully
understood that was trusted and widely

137
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,330
used

138
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,139
I predict a trust bubble meltdown coming
soon

139
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,080
for our industry and for exactly the
same reasons

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,319
we have complex operations

141
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,169
in place better in very complex tightly
intertwined systems

142
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,620
and the processes are not well
understood are analyzed

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,400
but they are widely used and trusted
that is a recipe for disaster and it

144
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,860
won't hold of long

145
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,979
the killer as a metaphor vendors in
other places

146
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,870
leave start building more quality into
the implementations

147
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,400
it can be done a mission not a at in
your chest today

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,260
skip question but I really want the
dentist to lean forward in the following

149
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,399
says

150
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,479
when you hear a month or two things
going on out there in the dallas won

151
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,539
Thunder abilities

152
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,490
and 0 days the big deal by Kathy got me

153
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,010
but there's a new day is based on the
vulnerability that may have been known

154
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,740
about for a long time

155
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,880
when the recent patch cycles Microsoft
went through and I'm not being all

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,779
Microsoft this could happen to anybody

157
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,420
they're just the unfortunate example
there was a vulnerability been known for

158
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,240
about 17 years not

159
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,170
yet patched and it caused a brutal
problem for them

160
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,870
a image wise in the patch cycle because
the patch cause blue screens the debt

161
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,000
machines are already infected and
therefore how the hell can pick up going

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,269
to happen anyway

163
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,240
the seventeen years and not yet
addressed give me a break

164
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,600
lean forward when you build developing a
product you can't go through all the

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,790
processes we do it in as a student
expansion we couldn't compete with you

166
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,040
and

167
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,339
devices but we do try to give robust
implementation

168
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,290
and for more than abilities you cover
and your competitors don't

169
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,720
fair is your competitive advantage when
there's only emerges

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,310
you survive they die it can be to your
commercial advantage damnit

171
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,080
put some money on the table leaned
forward on the vulnerabilities dole just

172
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,959
won't fit their

173
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,959
it to you first smell the attack in the
message

174
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:58,089
well that brings us to the end of this
year's could talk refers panel

175
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,870
I'd like to thank the audience for
joining us
