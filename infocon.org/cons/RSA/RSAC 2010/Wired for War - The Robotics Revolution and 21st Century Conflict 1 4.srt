1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,990
thank you what I'd like to do is
actually begin

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,190
with seeing from iraq and have you

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,250
alongside the road is what looks like a
piece of trash

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,039
that insurgents had not I ET at
improvised explosive device with great

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,619
care

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:21,039
now by 2006 or more than 2500

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,230
these roadside bombings in Iraq every
single month and they were leading cause

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,699
of casualties among both american
soldiers

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,230
as well as Iraqi civilians and the team
that hunting

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,090
for this I ET scalding godt explosive

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,200
ordnance disposal the pointy end of the
spear in the effort to stop a roadside

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,820
bombings

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,090
at Sabal tour in Iraq and he ODI team
will go out on just about 600 bomb calls

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,100
that is they'll be asked to defuse about
two bombs

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,629
every single day number that may be the
better indicator up there

16
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,199
value is the fact that the insurgents
but reported

17
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,730
fifty thousand dollar bounty on the head
a venir de trooper

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,260
kill one of them get fifty thousand
dollars unfortunately

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,790
this particular bomb call would not end
well by the time the soldier got close

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,070
enough to the device

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,979
see the telltale wires coming out from
it to see that it was a bomb not appease

22
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,479
trash exploded depending on how much
explosives packed into one of these

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,210
devices

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,570
yet to be as far away as a football
field to escape injury from the

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,729
fragments coming out chewable XP

26
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:30,400
back even if you're not hit just the
sheer force of the explosion itself can

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,360
break your lands

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
the soldier though had been right on top
of that bombing it exploded

29
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,939
so when the dust settled and the
research team advanced

30
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,619
they found that a lot not night the
commander of the unit did their sad duty

31
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,670
heard a condolence letter back United
States apologize for not being able to

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,950
bring not soldier home

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,030
they talked about how the rest of the
troops in unit consider them they're

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,950
brave assault

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,960
but then they also tried to talk up the
silver lining that they took away from

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,719
the tragedy

37
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,340
missus what they wrote quote at least

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,850
when a robot dice you don't have to
write a letter to its mother

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,770
that seeing may sound like

40
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,640
a cross between the movies Hurt Locker
an avatar

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,900
but is the actual story of the very
first robach

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,480
killed an action the

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,739
soldier killed was a forty two pound
robot called a cock

44
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,000
the destination about condolence letter
wasn't some farmhouse in Iowa like in

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
the old war movies

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,340
but was a company just outside
Burlington Massachusetts

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,470
on the side of the wall says iRobot it
is a

48
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,099
real-world company named after the
fictional Isaac Asimov novels

49
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,989
and the not so great Will Smith movie in
which robots

50
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,410
start out doing daily chores and move on
to making life-and-death decisions

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,580
now I am NOT one for PowerPoint in fact
we've banned it from my institution

52
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,129
but the Microsoft people tell me I would
get a swag bag unless I use PowerPoint

53
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,319
so what you're gonna see is actually not
wanted the clicks representations

54
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,680
but simply a series of pictures and
images and videos are gonna play behind

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,440
me not time to my talk anything

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,500
but rather just to give you a sense up
the reality

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,620
up this technology everything that you
see here is either already

58
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,489
operative in Iraq and Afghanistan right
now or Rd out the prototype stage

59
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,360
nothing is fantasy now the pull back on
all this

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,650
the book that I wrote wired for war is
about how

61
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,330
there something big going on in war
today

62
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,700
and maybe even overall history of
humanity itself the US military force

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,060
that went into Iraq in 2003

64
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,950
had a handful drones pilotless planes

65
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,010
unmanned aerial systems whatever you
want to call them

66
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,190
we now have over seven thousand

67
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,450
and the US military inventory the
invasion force on the ground

68
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,620
utilize 0 unmanned ground vehicles we
now have over 12,000

69
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,159
to give you another example the sea
change is happening this year

70
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,330
US Air Force will train more unmanned
systems operators and it will train

71
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,430
manned bomber man fighter plane pilots
combine

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,430
what we have to remember though is that
these predators these pack box

73
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,090
are the first generation a lot like the
Model T Ford or the Wright brothers

74
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,100
flyer

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,509
compared to what's already in prototype
stage what comes after that

76
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,720
and the technology term killer app

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
sharper killer application takes on an
entirely new meaning when you're talking

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,970
about these technologies

79
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,669
they're not just disruptive to industry
to war

80
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,229
we are arming them with everything from
fifty caliber machine guns Hellfire

81
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,990
missiles

82
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,580
that's what's happening right now
hearing forward one US Air Force

83
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,580
three-star general time I would describe
how very soon

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,470
it's not going to be thousands are
robots that we use in our wars as today

85
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,650
but quote tens of thousands but it's not
gonna be tens and thousands have these

86
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,210
robots in the next 1-2 Chelsea after
that

87
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,990
it's the ones that come later on
generation after generation

88
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,300
because wanna things that you're
familiar with of course is Moore's Law

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,470
the idea that we've been able to pack
more more computing power

90
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,500
indoor microchips such that they
basically double in their power capacity

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,220
just about under every two years

92
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,039
Moore's Law in action is for example the
reason that if you've ever gotten one of

93
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,960
those Hallmark greeting cards opened up
and played a little song

94
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,860
ever gotten one of those you held in
your hand more computing power than the

95
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,770
entire US

96
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,720
Air Force had in nineteen sixty thats
Moore's Law in action

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
now Moore's law holds true over the next
25 years

98
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,340
our systems are computers but also our
robots

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,270
will be a billion times more powerful
than today

100
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,400
and I don't mean a billion and kinda the
amorphous doctor evil one billion

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,539
way that people use that term I mean
literally take their power

102
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,600
and multiply it with a one and nine
zeros behind it

103
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,979
what if more slot doesn't hold true yet
culture over the last forty years

104
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,539
there's no guarantee that it's gonna
hold true for the next 25

105
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,620
what if it goes just $1,100 this fast

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,729
well that means that our computers our
robotics

107
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,069
will be a mere million times more
powerful than today

108
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,509
the point here is this the kind of
things that we used to only talk about

109
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,479
that science fiction conventions

110
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,590
like a comic-con need to be talked about
by

111
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,830
folks like us gathered here need to be
talked about by people in the pentagon

112
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,250
we're living through a robots revolution

113
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,370
how need to be very clear here when I
say robots revolution

114
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,970
particularly in this state I don't mean
that the Governator is gonna show up at

115
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,150
your door all other Terminator movies

116
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,370
it's the idea that every so often in
history

117
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,800
there's a technology that comes along
that is revolutionary

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,440
that rewrites the rules of the game most
important its not its capabilities that

119
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,580
truly matter

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,880
it's the questions that it forces upon
us that really matter

121
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,729
questions about what's possible we
didn't have to even think about what was

122
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,060
possible for

123
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,669
even more important questions about
what's proper questions

124
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,289
right now wrong we didn't have to
wrestle with for

125
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,949
when you go on ask people in the field
this store comparisons to where they see

126
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,840
robotics now

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,509
they illustrate this revolutionary
aspect for example most in the

128
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,220
scientists will tell you

129
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,620
that innocence we're at the stage with
robotics where we were

130
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,669
with automobiles around 1909

131
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,030
even how we term them unmanned systems
horseless carriages where we can only

132
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,030
drop our heads around what they are not

133
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,539
rather than what they are Ford Motor
Company in 1909 sold just about 250

134
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,080
Model T Fords

135
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
but spurred on by the demands of war
within 10 years

136
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,020
it was selling a million of them why did
automobile matter

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,710
didn't matter because you no longer have
to own for horses and keep them in a

138
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,919
stable

139
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,729
or is it report backs out on the world
mechanization

140
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,129
in war but also in society which leads
to things like for example

141
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,740
suburbia no automobile no suburbia

142
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,560
leads to social rebel attacks things
like dating

143
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,819
very concept didn't exist before
automobiles because kids had to court

144
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,300
on their parents from porch before they
got freedom the automobile

145
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,199
we see environmental a fax to come out
about with global climate change

146
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
but even more important we see a demand
for an entirely new

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,970
rules of the road traffic law so we
didn't have to conceivable

148
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,539
for and rules require an understanding
up the technology itself

149
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,240
so for example the very first traffic
laws entailed

150
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,490
that someone was suppose to walk in
front of the horseless carriage

151
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,670
with a flack to warn people and when
they got to an intersection they were

152
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,769
supposed to fire off a flare

153
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,300
another parallel the people making this
is one that bill gates made

154
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,680
is that we're with robotics right now
where we were with the computer

155
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,089
back in nineteen eighty big pokey device

156
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:07,519
limited set of functions we figured out
for it and most importantly the military

157
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,360
is a prime spender on research and
development

158
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,440
as well as a prime spender in terms of
client for the marketplace

159
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,700
but again why did the computer matter

160
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,550
very soon we learn more more functions
for

161
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,190
and soon it gets to the point that we
stop calling them computers anymore

162
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,320
i've a computer my kitchen I call it a
microwave oven I Drive a car that has

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,680
over 100 computers

164
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,149
and I'll call it a computerized car the
same things playing out with robotics

165
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,890
so for example you have the new Lexus
the parallel parks itself

166
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,580
you have the Volvo and Mercedes Benz
cars that HAP

167
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,680
crash avoidance technology which is a
very nice way of saying

168
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,690
the robot car takes over because the
stupid humans

169
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,820
don't look in a blind spot a lot but
again

170
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,110
computers matter not just because of the
processing power

171
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,670
but the report backs out on our world

172
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,920
they
