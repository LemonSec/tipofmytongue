1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,149
my pleasure to introduce to you doctor
john donohue

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,149
a doctor donahue is the director the
brown Institute for brain science

3
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:11,889
on as you learn he's not a security
specialist

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,380
rather he studies the way that the brain
converts

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,600
saw into motion and develops tools and
techniques to

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,529
eight patients were suffering from
paralysis he was invited to speak

7
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:26,820
at the arse a conference simply because
his work is it so important

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,750
and so intriguing that it kills
naturally to technologies have all

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,449
stripes

10
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,180
i think is is also the type remarkable
work

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,420
that's likely to intersect with our own
industry in the future

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,079
in unexpected ways abducted on who is
going to give

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,750
a slide presentation and once he's
concluded the presentation

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,600
you know I will have an opportunity for
a short question-and-answer session

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,250
please join me in welcoming doctor john
donohue

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,340
skies

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,220
the

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,360
the

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
well thank everybody for coming in thank
you for the invitation

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,170
on I am a bit unusual for an audience
like this but I thought it would that

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,360
show you something about the %uh the
kind of work they were doing to

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,360
connect the brain to the Internet so
what you're looking at here

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,260
is a young man playing a video game it's
called he managed to hit the targets

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,780
that our treasure chest and avoid the
goblins this is something that is

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,570
I you know not so surprise except to say
maybe is not doing a great job except

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,020
this young man who's in his twenties

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,320
name is Matt Nagel is completely
paralyzed

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,350
he cannot move from the neck down due to
an injury in this

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,180
spinal cord and he's controlling that
person with his break

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,390
he has a tiny sensor implanted in his

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,009
what's called the motor cortex its where
his hand commands are generated they

32
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:57,690
come out

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,250
and they're being decoded on the outside
through a series of computers and those

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,740
brain signals are being used

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,380
I had to control the cursor by him
thinking about moving his hand

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,660
so this is a device for developing to
help people who are paralyzed

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,820
but it is it's been called the neural
interface system or brain computer

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,690
interface in all these other things we
just call it brain gate

39
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,180
and the device itself I'm gonna tell you
about

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,730
how this device works and I gotta give
you a little bit a background

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,280
love why that device could actually be
developed how could we possibly go from

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,030
the brain to the outside world

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,230
I with with the cable basically in a few
computers

44
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,410
and then I'm gonna try to give you some
perspective on how all of this

45
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,750
might fit into our world in the future
so

46
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,799
one might ask what why would you want

47
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,900
that even build such a thing and that
one reason is that

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,980
there are a large number of diseases
that lead to the condition of paralysis

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,530
in which

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,989
people's brains are able to think
they're

51
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,519
cognitively intact but the message is
from the movement areas

52
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,480
to the outside world can't beacon are
connected their broken off

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,980
that common one that made you probably
know spinal cord injury

54
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,500
and what spinal cord injury does it
basically interrupts the cable from the

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,290
brain

56
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,620
to the outside to the spinal cord and by
interrupting at the commands can't get

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,920
out

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,860
so the there are millions of people who
are paralyzed from this bear

59
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,780
variety of diseases that I've listed
here and I won't go through some other

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,270
were just

61
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,849
jammers too many view they all share in
common the

62
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,830
up the feature that the brain functions
in the body does not

63
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,750
so we need a way to get from the brain
to the outside world

64
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,370
and this is the system that we developed
it is %uh this is the brain gate

65
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,599
it consistent this tiny sensor I its

66
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,780
a that the little black sensor with the
little hairs coming out of it

67
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,660
is there something the size of a baby
aspirin four by four millimeters

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,940
it has 100 here the electrodes coming
out a bit that are sensors that are put

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,890
into the brain

70
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,940
is put into this was called arm area of
the brain

71
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,830
currently in its sorta crude pilot for
men has a plug on the head were all

72
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,900
those signals come out

73
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,330
the crackling noise you hear is signals
from one of them and I'll tell you more

74
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,379
about those in a minute

75
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,879
and the the signal is then processed

76
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,580
from front through a cable that goes
through cable through an amplifier

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,330
through a cart full of computers and get
converted into basically what a mouse

78
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,979
control

79
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,440
so that's the system that we call brain
gate that we develop it was actually

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,260
develop

81
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,390
up based on a number of years %uh work

82
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,789
handle in my laboratory in other
people's laboratories to show that

83
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,400
these kinds of things would actually
work in humans up but we didn't have the

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,460
testing in humans

85
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,650
im so here here's just a concept diagram
of how we thought through the problem in

86
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,159
lead

87
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,890
from something that was that an idea and
had its basis in

88
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,080
in basic science research but had to
really be tested in humans

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,770
so in this condition the brain is
disconnected from action

90
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,060
I and we're trying to build a bridge
from the brain to the outside world

91
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,610
the brain signals could be used to
control computers

92
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,210
I'm that is directly plugging the brain
into the internet through computer

93
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,050
potentially

94
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,289
to assistive technologies that is
anything that can help people

95
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,520
to robots say assist the robot that
could help an individual who is

96
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,370
paralyzed

97
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,580
to artificial limbs that is people who
have lost their limit you could make an

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,440
artificial limb and then connect the
brain back up to that women

99
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,680
and move it or even back to the muscles
themselves so you could

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,770
reanimate the muscles but the brain
reconnected back to the muscles and and

101
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,560
allow movement to happen again

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,210
so most people say how the heck could
you possibly do that and it is a big

103
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,750
and complex problem and these are some
of the big questions we had to answer

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,470
what what area of the brain

105
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,530
would you even selected get signals say
to move your arm which is the kind of

106
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,150
signals that we targeted

107
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,430
and what what are the signals you'd even
look for what are the brain signals that

108
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,830
give rise to commands what are they like
what's the sensor you would use

109
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,800
are you just saw the center and I'll
show you a little bit more about it

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,160
about

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,639
what is that what could you use to pick
up his brain signals

112
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,770
and for possibly leave them there for
say 70

113
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,160
eighty years how did you code so it fits
in with the theme at this conference

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,430
we don't have a reserve a stone in
neuroscience we have to figure out what

115
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,199
the brains

116
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,870
coding scheme is and try to understand
it and finally what technologies and I

117
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,270
just showed you the kind of technologies
we might connect to

118
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,820
so I just what we're going to do now is
have a little Nora 101

119
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,810
and just give some background
information I think that will %uh have

120
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,630
some interesting

121
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,050
parallels to the the to computing
internet and

122
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,180
inmate generate some interest from

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,000
those if you're interested in security
up but also I think it's a

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,410
fascinating to get some overview of how
the brain works a little help you

125
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,400
understand

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,449
how in fact weekend build brain gate
build it a connection between the brain

127
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,680
and the outside world

128
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,759
so the blue thing there's the brain the
outside is the cerebral cortex

129
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,300
I it's the part we think is the
intelligent part of the nervous system

130
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,889
world the smart stuff goes on it's
covered by this rind

131
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,340
business is so if you slice through it
you can see that sorta grayish looking

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,259
stuff

133
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,330
there's a i a sheet about the size of a
large pizza but it's all crumpled up

134
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,199
inside your head so it fits

135
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,740
at about two millimeters thick robust
because an orange peel and basically all

136
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,090
the computing for your

137
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,639
thinking and speaking in hearing is all
going on in that

138
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,410
there about 10 billion neurons and
neurons are

139
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,520
brain cells their spidery things they
have perfect things you can see in that

140
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,160
wonder on

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,460
are recipient parts have the neuron they
receive inputs

142
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,280
they have about 5,000 have them there
most them are very weak

143
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,650
connections that converge from large
numbers of other neurons

144
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,319
and they emit signals they sum up the
signals and they fire these

145
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,850
electrical spikes I which are actually
called spikes

146
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,900
and they're about a thousand the bus ok
second long impulse and that's the

147
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,530
communications system that neurons

148
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,110
neurons are very sophisticated
computational device is the take

149
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,530
a lot and we can put in convert them
into pulses I'm

150
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,360
and those connections that they have
with other neurons are called synapses

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,949
just

152
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,069
was shown there so there's a

153
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,330
interesting parallel between the brain
and and other real-world phenomena

154
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,030
including the Internet

155
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,900
so those of you who know about small
world nets are those about other kinds

156
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,610
of admiral networks

157
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,889
the brain is I'm on the left there and
on the right is actually a

158
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,250
a the Internet and its connection

159
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,449
a connection diagram above it internet
and personal looks a little bit like a

160
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,690
brain but its the brain is actually
wired like this

161
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,800
and that the parallel is the brain is
wired with lots of local connections and

162
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,479
a few

163
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,459
largely just a few long-distance
connections and by that basically

164
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,380
everything is connected everything else

165
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,110
but functions tend to be clustered in
areas

166
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,190
so if you're trying to find an area I
say for

167
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,730
connecting to something that will
control arm movement we know

168
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,410
it's basically from a hundred years have
nor science that I

169
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,880
functions are localized so in the back
of your head which is to the right there

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,319
is seeing just above your year there's
an area for hearing

171
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,920
and there's a strip that goes from the
top of your head out to your job own

172
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,470
about half an inch wide called the motor
cortex it's a stripper that

173
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,780
cortex and all in your movements are
generated

174
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,530
or funneled through that area and its
subdivided so that the middle third

175
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,530
controls your arm

176
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,670
and in fact now is good for you I'm just
control the army the other side of your

177
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,060
body

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,010
so we know where to go in the brain
that's the area that we would target

179
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,280
that's the place the generates

180
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,490
commands now what it what are the
signals

181
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,650
and brain signals are extraordinarily
complex there are basically two kinds

182
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,500
once called field potentials in one is
called spike so I like a computer which

183
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,459
just has

184
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,199
basically you know a diode that goes up
and down zeros and ones

185
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,810
the the inputs the cells the broad

186
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,070
currents flowing around in your brain is
one kind of signal

187
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,170
which is this FPR feel potential and

188
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,649
you can see one running across the
screen there and it it is the most

189
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,709
familiar example is the EGFP electrical
potentials you can record on the outside

190
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,470
your head

191
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,500
it's due to all the currents flowing
through all the neurons in your brain so

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,790
it's sort of a smeared function
