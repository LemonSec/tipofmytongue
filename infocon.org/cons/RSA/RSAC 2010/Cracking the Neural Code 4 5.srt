1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,580
helping with the world again they feel
cut off you know they're the same as you

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,299
ride the they have the same

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:09,309
I goals and aspirations and they have no
limitations in their brain they just

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,570
have limitations from their bodies

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,610
so all of them are extremely excited
very happy

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,300
they want to move again I mean that's
that the greatest goal is to move again

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,960
and we have to be very careful course

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,820
not to promise too much I C well

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,160
a of course our audiences intensely
interested in codes and cryptography

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,119
and your cracking one of the most
interesting codes in existence it in

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,360
your own coating the brain

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,430
I'm to talk a little bit about your
efforts in constructing the current

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,100
generation

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,520
a brain gay as you work on future
generations

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,210
%uh what is the frontier where did the
challenges lies in the matter

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,210
love on the scale of the problem

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,710
or other actually qualitative
differences as you begin incorporate new

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,340
features

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,039
well it is an immense problem you know
it was one of those things it was an

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,109
easy problem we will figure out how the
brain worked a long time ago its it's a

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,399
very complex problem

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,620
and we don't no up really what the
spiking signals

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,090
actually me they are the brains code we
r

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,560
developing as a kinda encyclopedia

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,960
no run by your honor what they do how
did they get involved in hearing or

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,119
seeing or moving

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,210
and we know that they have common
features but we just don't understand

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,540
the way that transformation occurs from
integrating

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,159
huge amount of information into some
kind of spike train we have

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,270
just beginnings have that understanding
well

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,720
brink it restores lost capabilities to
patients who

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,020
are suffering from it from a dysfunction
on

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,700
but as you've shown it's possible to
control more than artificial limbs

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,000
showed for instance the ability to
control a cursor I'm

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,049
can you envision a day when

36
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,750
on healthy patients have implants that
this sort

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,920
to supplement their functionality in the
world I don't know

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,479
implant that help people stick to their
diets or control devices for a third

39
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,880
armored and something along those lines
so

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
so there are many people who think about
these kinds of things that they they

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,060
want to be able to

42
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,030
extend their capabilities so the first
thing that this is a medical device

43
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,730
we're trying to develop something

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,900
or individuals with disabilities to make
their lives better

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,580
I the biggest barriers this does require
brain surgery

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,940
so we don't take that lightly it's
something that you know is always raises

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,660
a concern

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,900
I am where we will go with this and how
we will use it I think will require

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,410
serious debate serious discussion

50
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,720
but as I said I think the barrier will
always be

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,930
the surgical one that we we will not in
the Cavalier

52
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,330
implant able-bodied people I'm to

53
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,540
to have consider frivolous functions and
the other hand

54
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,090
we have many things already available
that her aides will have smartphones

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,260
that carry around

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,019
that are substitute for memory is again
telephone numbers and thing so we have

57
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,069
many many devices and so it would have
to be clear that

58
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,970
at some point we would outstrip all of
the available external technology to

59
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,620
ever even begin to think about

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,080
enhancing us by implanting something in
the brain well

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,040
have you in fact been approached by
industries or companies or government

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
agencies who

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,099
are hoping to exploit bring gate for
purposes other than the strictly medical

64
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:13,709
one

65
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,170
I wouldn't say exploit I think that that
I mentioned

66
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,200
this EG like signal that is available
from outside your head

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,349
so there's a lot of people interested in
whether how much control can you get

68
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:24,940
from that

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,989
and in fact it is a very noisy and very
hard to manage signal

70
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,420
and it's not very reliable so a there
are number people who would like to see

71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,040
bat signal be as good as the one you get
from inside your head

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,060
it's not going to be I think if you
could want me to do is one place where

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,040
it's actually being

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,950
there's a great deal of interest in that
isn't it toy industry I you can get a

75
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,440
little bit absurd have are you

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,330
thinking are you more rows are you happy
or your little bit more relaxed you can

77
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,709
pick that signal up with a very simple
toy like device and sold for gamers

78
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,970
this'll be a fun toy

79
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,959
and that there are couple companies
already making devices I think we'll be

80
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,890
out this christmas

81
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,090
so could that that had something that
will be around

82
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,379
well or are there frivolous or dangerous
applications that

83
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,980
you're afraid if up seeing I

84
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,709
well the the use a brain gate requires
the participation

85
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,769
%uh the user so if you don't want it to
work

86
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,880
you it it just it won't do anything you
have to actually participate in use

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,419
so we're not too worried about that but
as I said there are

88
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,300
a the people are always trying to say
where will this go and I think they draw

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,250
from that this

90
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,400
science fiction movies as I said the
kinds interfaces that you see

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,470
in in Pickard for example that kinda
integration up the machine

92
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,220
in the human is really extremely far as
we just week at

93
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,280
tapping into the nervous system is very
difficult and taking singles out we

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,110
don't understand

95
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,139
so we have a extremely long time before
work where

96
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,550
a level like that so it may be a little
early for me to

97
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,080
asked this question but I'm as the
technology evolves

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,860
what person that the first ethical
quandaries that that you foresee

99
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,710
a in in terms of the patients a you know
one thing

100
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,780
these are not being ethical quandaries
it's about paying for them

101
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,900
they can be very expensive we have
models love

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,430
how to pay for expensive devices but how
do you decide who gets them

103
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,889
those kinds of things so if there's a a
person who doesn't have the means to pay

104
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:21,960
for it

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,419
and a person who does then who decides
who gets those

106
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,840
the technology well

107
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
let me ask her some questions that may
relate to the technology

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,850
as it will appear in 10 or 20 years

109
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,360
but on well actually let let me ask a

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,600
a question about what what you could do
today if you were given

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,050
ample enough resources so free if we
gave you $10 million dollar grant and

112
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,660
failing

113
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,270
liberal surgical access to patient up
could you build an infallible

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,570
lie-detector

115
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,669
meant that is that within the realm of
possibility no because we don't

116
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,470
understand the basis of lying

117
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,569
and those kinda was ok we're looking at
very simple functions like left and

118
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,280
right

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,830
you know their very simple kinds of
control so we can understand those

120
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,350
there there are few places in the brain
where we can get some insights into your

121
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,370
thought processes but they're really
only

122
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,770
a guess so we were so dim guessing and
sometimes were right but we always

123
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,590
whenever we tap into single neurons we
were all we always have some probability

124
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,069
being

125
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,060
wrong and we had nothing like what up
well i

126
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,360
you know we have no concept of what the
neural representation II would even look

127
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,139
like

128
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,919
so as I said it's hard enough to know
we're working at what is a neural

129
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,300
representation in the spotlight look
like what is a representation uva

130
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,660
wholeness sound a word we is beyond our

131
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,020
but currently I what is the neural
representation

132
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,160
a movement you heard little bit what
that sounds like but putting it all

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,590
together the assembly problem is the big
one

134
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,660
that's a huge barrier and where I think

135
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,949
what we need is this is where science
plays a big role where

136
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,210
for the first time listening into the
human brain thinking acting human brain

137
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,220
were actually able to

138
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,639
ask you know what's going on in there we
can actually asked the participants what

139
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,880
are you thinking about

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,750
and we can get some clue about what that
activity is

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,099
interestingly if you ask Matthew what is
he thinking about while he moves the

142
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,150
cursor around

143
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,090
who make up a different story every day
it's sort of the same kind of story

144
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,220
that if you said to a little kid who
gets up and brushes their teeth

145
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,560
what did your brain tell your arm to get
your toothbrush to go up to your mouth

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,190
they don't know it just works you know
and so pretty much that's what happens

147
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,949
they somehow think about moving

148
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,110
and the first to remove the events
unfold

149
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,560
and we've even found that people begin
to come up with to

150
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,770
crazy a strategy that it begins not to
work so well

151
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,770
they just have to let it flow naturally
on

152
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,340
one thing I would I would love to see
would be a

153
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,720
an external projection of dreams as it
were the movie

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,690
a movie rendering is that simply of the
books or is it conceivable

155
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,580
of them they will be able to do that so
see you are you are actually

156
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,220
bring up but an issue that something
that is looked at some it is known that

157
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,879
if you

158
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,270
do something I'll give you a sense of
how primitive our knowledge is

159
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,960
in rats if you have a rat run around the
room there's a little part of your brain

160
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,280
so deep buried on the inside

161
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,910
that unfold a map of space and what each
little neurons says

162
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,710
I'm here I'm in the next bite him in the
neck spot and when the red goes to sleep

163
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,460
and dreams

164
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,720
it replaced the sequence somewhere and
so you can actually predict

165
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,669
if the rat ran across the stage he ran
out the door any replayed it's been you

166
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,909
can actually reconstruct

167
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,659
that from from the from the activity
that they have in their sleep

168
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,560
but that's a long way from projecting at
your dreams of whatever you dream about

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,940
a out into the solving

170
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,050
cryptography or something you know yeah
onto a projection screen

171
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,850
might bring bring in the line of
questioning and perhaps a little closer

172
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,820
to reality

173
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,830
I'm sure many in the audience were
wondering about the application of this

174
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,260
technology to information security

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm for example to think that brain
waves art

176
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,149
distinctive enough to identify
individuals to computing systems

177
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,190
could they ultimately serve as a
replacement for biometrics

178
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,380
fingerprints for instance yet that there
are

179
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,130
I think the the the variability is so
great and

180
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,680
it's also the reliability of detecting
the signals as you can just put your

181
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
head in a

182
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,350
you know dome and get in a simple
structure and get

183
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,140
get a get a good signal that is it's
very sensitive and exactly how you set

184
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,950
it up

185
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,930
so there's a lot of variability just
from that and then an individual's

186
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,240
arm I think it would take a pretty
sophisticated system

187
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,339
to see whether there is a a neural
signature but we do know already for

188
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,750
example there are some people that have
a potential in their brain

189
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,279
it's called a p0300 but it's a surprise
potential if I show you something

190
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,190
something pops up new on the screen

191
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,970
you have this little electrical
potential it pops up you can record it

192
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,250
even from the outside

193
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,470
but it's not that reliable and about 15
percent people don't even have it
