1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,330
and yet the people that our customers
are saying over and over again

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,359
make it stop make it go away it's just
too hard

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,750
in fact you know what to do when they
have a major data breach right now in

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,429
companies

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,900
this guy said I'm really weird about my
company lose my data I'm a driver I'm a

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,710
further lose

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,810
day that they put online 'cause use
third party service providers

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,820
you know what happens when people
actually bridger data the parliament

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,930
Institute study said

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,010
there's five things in you wanna miss

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,320
these more corruption a charge
compression company and lucky to have a

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,640
legacy pgp behind me but I'll tell you
something

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,140
encryption is not a solution by itself

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,879
anybody tell you that is lying to you
again make sound as good as they want

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,670
we've been doing it for 20 years

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,309
and it's not the sole remedy the content
classification

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,640
let's find out what day is important and
let's put that stuff

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,660
work along some by the way let's not put
it on the web

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,829
let's not make it work can be attacked
so the new in the OP

20
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,579
data classification they're adding more
access controls

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,260
the recent announcement seven major
cloud suppliers the last two weeks to

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,130
come out said

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,210
we're ready to go to the cloud and what
we've done is we've put more locks in

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,860
place

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,229
we've put more train people in place

26
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,140
we put better authentication place that
someone 1965 the men from

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,200
and then this is something that I one of
the guys that

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,049
from founded the CSA the class security
line seven this morning he said you know

29
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:30,640
doc

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,869
they tell you to trust them market runs
with that seen in animal house where the

31
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,790
guy give this car over the guys in so
what happened early so they trust us

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,189
that's what happens when you get in the
ass right now sell and some research

33
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,619
lost all my customers dead another suing
me

34
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,990
this said Asian the process that a
solution

35
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,540
we're gonna have to take this hat on if
we're going to make the cloud come to

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,310
fruition

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,740
and diversity see all we want you look
at the clout

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,710
it's really interesting because people
think a bit in some definitions as

39
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,690
is a big ubiquitous mass when in reality

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,430
it's a whole bunch of other kinds the
club's and they all meshed together

41
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,890
in the interesting pieces this is that

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,849
I look at things like the custom
application platforms and Internet

43
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:22,660
platforms

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,970
and all the other technologies are going
to this niceee

45
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,230
so what's different about the cloud
versus those first three rows

46
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,480
because some people are arguing that
they're just extensions and other people

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,870
saying it's a brand new paradigm

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,580
max hopper would say its different
except for two things because he was the

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,200
sarbanes-oxley expert

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,140
in a second career after time for
American Airlines those two big drivers

51
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,489
that didn't exist nearly as much then as
they do now

52
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,680
one is compliance and the unholy
alliance if compliance with regulations

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,879
and all you know the compliance
regulations do not I repeat do not

54
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,489
equal security ask anybody who's passed
a PCI audit

55
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,640
and then had the records bridge and a
growing threat

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,590
are definitively different than the
people had first the first three rows

57
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,659
this all started roughly eight years ago

58
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,920
when people started to say we're gonna
have to defend people had their data

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,500
breached

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,690
data breach as I talked about is still a
major problem has a major cost attached

61
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,629
to it but this part of the cloud the
complexity environment

62
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,290
compliancy regulations red make sure job

63
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,420
is IT security practitioners that much
more

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,900
difficult in fact I would say a
near-impossible

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,209
I don't know any other group for people
in the world that if you were

66
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,280
a professional athlete call yourself a
professional baseball player in america

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,310
and you hit $9.99 at a thousand

68
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,370
your failure I don't know your
profession the world that you guys have

69
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,590
that kind of pressure on your

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,670
baseball player for those are you're not
from the US

71
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,959
if you hit 30 to 10 they give you have a
hundred million dollars and call your

72
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,700
fundamentally much tougher job in the
data security business is this

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,849
I mention the Cloud Security Alliance
Cloud Security Alliance came together

74
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,480
6500 people as a grassroots movement

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,690
to publish a series of documents to say
we're the best practices

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,750
so if you're going to go to the cloud
what can you do here's one place you can

77
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,600
go to get great information because

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,740
the docking was put together by two
hundred volunteers and some the best

79
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,949
minds in the industry

80
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,860
designed to help you if you're gonna
take the plunge in the cloud can put

81
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,190
your date out there

82
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,160
this is what you can go look at to do

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,690
it says that the first thing your gonna
run to that's different is a technology

84
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,449
said issues

85
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,620
it's a set legal issues so

86
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,930
you thought you had trouble with your
own attorneys and how so you're outside

87
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,090
counsel

88
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,410
fundamentally when you go to the cloud
the way data is treated

89
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,979
legally is very different wants of
Primus

90
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,669
sold the legal issues are going to be
paramount as you move forward

91
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,080
regulatory environment we talked about
it some these are well known you can add

92
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
the European laws

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,310
you can add what they're doing in Asia
right now they're looking at the on

94
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,380
national breach laws in the EU

95
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,729
all these things are gonna continue
becoming continue to bother you

96
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,539
we had a bunch of people talking about
this PCI all this regulatory things

97
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,100
they are going to continue to press on

98
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,650
the ability to move data freely and
securely in the cloud

99
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,800
he's gonna have to answer to these if
you breach

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
but the one I find most interesting and
when we don't talk a lot about his

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,699
jurisdictional data

102
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,350
and that is where your clout Supplier
takes your information

103
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,570
and actually moves it to third party or
offshore where the laws may be honest

104
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,960
friendly

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,020
remember the government's on this
friendly or maybe the

106
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,550
laws governing intellectual property are
as friendly

107
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,250
its at third when jurisdictional
grouping that you should spend a lot of

108
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,199
time on

109
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,500
because it's one that you have no
control over once you've given the data

110
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,500
over to the cloud

111
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,009
or the other differences there's one key
technical difference

112
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,539
that is really come up version are said
he believes is the one that if we don't

113
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,020
solve

114
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,319
we're really going to have problems in
the car the future said you federated

115
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,860
trust

116
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,569
you know prosper find yeah great
marketing slogan for PGP

117
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,639
VeriSign's been using it for years and
there were people talk about who do you

118
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,919
trust in the Internet

119
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,410
will fundamentally federating trust in
this environment is going to be the

120
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,460
biggest issue

121
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,919
how to people who are sharing
infrastructure and sharing

122
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,490
storage in sharing processing ability
have those people come together

123
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,060
and agree on watch that our rules and
laws are going to be governed by

124
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,919
federating at Ross and making sure trust
providers deal trust providers is not a

125
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,050
morning shift

126
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,750
you got three new external issues that I
think turkey

127
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,360
first one is one that people don't talk
a lot about and that's organized crime

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,949
well criminal gangs has just been proven

129
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,530
are the guys that are the twelve largest
data breaches that we've happen in a row

130
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,750
same group of people estimated over 100
million dollars was their tech

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,069
and there and pretty for in the world
for about three and a half years

132
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,199
so there is a sense finally caught the
kingpin

133
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,530
who unfortunately also was an inside
informant

134
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,410
to the government past two trusted

135
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,759
providers trusted sources fundamentally

136
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,849
would you trust out there if you can put
your data in the cloud these guys

137
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,190
attacked week system systems or patched

138
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,030
used a variety of things that went
through that but they were prompted by

139
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,039
crime

140
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,960
and profit it's a big issue if you look
at the second area

141
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,500
and it's an area that i think is is is
very very interesting that we don't talk

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,389
about insider threat

143
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,090
every time there's been a downturned
economy in the last thirty years

144
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,289
correlated studies have shown that data
is stolen

145
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,650
last fall there was a study that said
most people are laid off

146
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,590
do something or can or would do
something maliciously to their employers

147
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,990
including stealing information stealing
I P or shutting down K systems

148
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,080
huge insider threat with the 1i think
that we've seen

149
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,300
that brought the most process and i
think is a

150
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,560
is a crossroad moment for most of us the
room the reader suppliers are

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,690
practitioners

152
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,259
decided nation-states and the bad actors
who are they were they do

153
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,120
and who they work in concert with
because this takes it from

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,300
are we gonna lose our jobs are gonna get
finder we gonna have some regulatory

155
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,870
problems

156
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,930
tour we lose our intellectual property
and see it pop up someplace

157
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,100
that could put us out of business even
worse in now to reassure customers

158
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,269
individually targeted

159
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,060
and even worse in at we're gonna see
things that we make or supply

160
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,610
going to be lost ultimately and here is
the prime defense

161
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,740
in the war in cyber terror folks this
isn't but this just happens in front

162
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,730
page every newspaper

163
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,850
secretary said clinton got up and talk
about it publicly we need to do

164
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,970
something about this

165
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,440
those are areas that the people in the
air is a computing never had to deal

166
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,220
with

167
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,950
red work-up which you do it's a
completely

168
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,480
different completely different

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,560
said expectations on use practitioners
in the last when you're gonna have to

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,420
consider

171
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,779
is trusted providers you know again who
do you trust

172
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,610
we gonna buy from who are the people
that you're already using the cloud

173
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,130
you're gonna put your data there and
what promises they make you

174
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,430
trust me given the last three I talked
about my really want to think about that

175
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,779
because geolocation and restriction

176
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,649
is going to be a big reason why or why
not you picked those providers

177
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,580
and the vendors I'm a vendor

178
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,709
we're not doing a good enough job for
you back in some cases in the cloud we

179
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,339
failed you

180
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,480
with type 2 we told you lower your cost
and then
