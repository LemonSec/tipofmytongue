1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,550
data cloud provider says no we think you
did Manager ID is right

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,710
now someone has to investigate the cloud
providers as well we'll investigate the

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,780
clout components

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,870
and hospital says no we don't want you
to investigate what we think is your own

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,759
misconduct

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,890
we want to investigate and then the club
by say Happy New investigate we have co

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,470
tenants on this machine

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,859
you can see there data how we can manage
those kinds of problems going forward is

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,410
going to be very interesting but having
a trusted stack having a good audit

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,710
trails will be critical

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,200
to getting trust in the cloud model
identity and privacy are going to be key

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,170
why because as people move more and more
there dated the clout their identity

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,390
is the access point to that data as can
be critically important

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,289
their companies produce technologies and
we've been talking about it for years

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,469
but produced technologies that allow us
to better manage identities

16
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,510
particularly across trust domains

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,250
so we have some good news to announce in
this regard first of all we're releasing

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,770
Forefront Identity Manager 2010

19
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,430
which is a policy-based ID management
system

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,189
that has a self-service model 1 says
much easier to manage identities

21
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,189
the other thing is super important
though is we're releasing you prove

22
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,170
technology

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,150
is this something Microsoft uninvolved
in a few years ago

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,380
and the key to understanding you prove
technologies and I'll show you a video

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,490
about it in a minute

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,780
is it allows people to have multiple
ideas if you remember my presentation

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,470
last year

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,990
the way you avoid the National identify
arguments

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,150
is the grant people multiple like these
that they can use different ID's at

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,229
different times

31
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,950
it's a claims based model so you can
pass claims about yourself instead of

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,110
your whole identity

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,790
any provides for limited disclosure
tokens

34
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,210
so you can limit the amount of
information you disclose

35
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,130
so that you can execute a transaction
without revealing too much about

36
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,890
yourself

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,990
at the same time we have Active
Directory Federation services that will

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,790
allow you to

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,429
to now federated eighties across trusted
domains

40
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,430
so how can we put this stuff together
last year I showed you a

41
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,879
small prototype that we were doing with
the Lake Washington School District with

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,330
children got proved in the school's
office

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,959
and then had a credential well we
continued along this path and we are now

44
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:26,950
been working

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,640
with a partner in Germany getting ready
for the Germany ID card that is coming

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,540
and I wanted to share with you a video
to show you the work that is going on in

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,090
Germany

48
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,090
on as citizens and businesses expect
more access to public services

49
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,420
the demand for stronger protection
measures and greater privacy grounds

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,480
on in Germany the Federal Ministry of
the Interior station

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,080
includes any government program to issue
secure electronic identity cards

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,819
beginning in November 2010 from hafer
focused in Berlin create solutions for

53
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,120
partners in industry

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,920
research and public administration
solutions developed by focusing its

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,030
partners are designed and tested in
their demonstration center

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,150
which hosts the German he ID system

57
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,050
the range of requirements that form the
basis for the identity project at Focus

58
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,970
laboratories

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,819
include legal privacy and technology
considerations

60
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,540
to help protect enable the citizens and
businesses in Germany

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,080
one key requirement is a process if in
person proving with legally acceptable

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,879
forms of documentation

63
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,860
this step helps to provide a trusted
relationship between all parties

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,709
involved

65
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,840
insuring online identities are created
from certifiable sources

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,950
to facilitate safe confidential exchange
information

67
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,370
while protecting individuals privacy
another key requirement is that personal

68
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,090
data must be secured

69
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,700
the system should enable people to
disclose the minimal amount of identity

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,610
information:

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,049
with their consent leveraging focuses
competencies in this area and featuring

72
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,019
some of Microsoft's identity and access
management technologies

73
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,230
including Active Directory Federation
services

74
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,820
information cards any you prove minimal
disclosure technology

75
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,710
a system is being created that enables
universities and students to safely

76
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,199
interact online with trust and
confidence

77
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,470
to demonstrate this system Erica uses
her government the ID card

78
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,470
and is able to enroll at the Technical
University of Berlin

79
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,100
open communication systems the
University

80
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,500
issues a student information cart Erica
equipped with privacy enhancing you

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,940
prove tokens for use in various web
sites

82
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,880
part of the certified information about
erica is derived from her government the

83
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,100
ID card

84
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,080
while the rest is added from the
University registration process

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,160
the university has a trust relationship
with a commercial

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,180
online bookstore i and Erica's program
includes a subscription to a large

87
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,900
catalog online books

88
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,860
because the university and bookstore use
the you prove technology with

89
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,479
information cards

90
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,139
Erica can disclose that she is a
registered online student and nothing

91
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,030
more

92
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,870
a verifiable statement eligibility to
access the e-books

93
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,650
at the conclusion of each semester the
University collect feedback to improve

94
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,330
the quality and delivery education
programs

95
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,449
Erica can rate your experience and
comment on professors freely without any

96
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,460
concern of retaliation or follow-up

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,090
the only information she consents to
disclose is that she is a registered

98
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,539
online student enrolled in specific
classes

99
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,080
she has the option to disclose other
details such as gender

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,900
for questions on fair treatment moreover

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,699
with this system the minimal amount of
information that she disclosed in these

102
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,729
two online sessions cannot be linked

103
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,729
the online bookstore cannot learn
anything more about her

104
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,199
any university cannot track your usage
if the information card

105
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,350
Erica will have access to a world online
experiences with her citizen ID

106
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,690
and she will now have choices when it
comes to her privacy and personal

107
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,350
information

108
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,479
these choices embrace the freedom to
participate without traceability

109
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,020
without concern for reprisal or the
collection unnecessary information

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,789
the work the Fraunhofer fokus the German
government and microsoftr doing

111
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:33,490
is helping to drive a new generation
online public services

112
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,000
these offerings will provide businesses
and citizens the flexibility of online

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,330
transactions

114
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,340
with the benefits have stronger
protection measures and greater privacy

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,950
them so that's an example of how we can
take some with the principles we've been

116
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,310
talking about for the last couple years

117
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,670
and actually start applying them in
real-world environment

118
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,750
but we've also said that this is not
Microsoft problem this has always been

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,140
an

120
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,170
ecosystem problem and so it's critically
important that everyone participate

121
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,970
so today we're announcing a couple of
things first law with regard to you

122
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,270
prove we're releasing

123
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,990
under the open specification promise the
patented crypto algorithms have you

124
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,210
prove and we're donating under the
FreeBSD license to reference tool kits

125
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,350
implementing the algorithms additionally
we're releasing a second specification

126
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,490
under OS P

127
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,840
for integrating you prove into open
source identity selectors

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,640
that will be accompanied by preview code
integrating you prove

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,080
ADFS windows identity foundation

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,840
and card space the key is to get more
people to embrace these kinds of

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,070
technologies

132
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,720
so that we can create the identity med
assist in that we've been talking about

133
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,940
for quite a while

134
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,690
and that finally I want to talk about
the cloud

135
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,010
and social political alignment one of
the things about the cloud is this

136
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,820
elasticity and the fact that data can go
anywhere

137
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,840
but what's really interesting to me is
that

138
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,320
the cloud has the potential to alter the
balance of power between the individual

139
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,640
in that state

140
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,970
in a pre IT world if the government
wanted

141
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,130
data from a they have to come to me to
get it

142
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,300
they can bring a search warrant to
search my house

143
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,490
where they could bring a subpoena and I
could move to quash the subpoena

144
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,560
or produce the documents of course the
world has changed

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,510
first came the telephone and the
capability to wiretap

146
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,840
a wiretapping was about a federal
communications

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,229
you to capture them in real time where
they were gone

148
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,350
then came the first killer app for the
internet email

149
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,840
and suddenly there was a
store-and-forward technology

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,140
and suddenly government to go to a
service provider and say

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,060
here's a subpoena or court order or
search warrant you have to turn over

152
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,690
certain records relating

153
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,250
to the subscriber and even the content
of their males

154
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,400
and so over time there's been the
ability of the government to get more

155
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,949
data

156
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,240
added this IT environment but as we
migrate to the cloud

157
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,839
they will be even more this everything
will go to the cloud of the vision is

158
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,330
right

159
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,800
your help recoger tax record your diary
which you want to be able to access

160
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,540
from all sorts of different devices from
your phone to your PC

161
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,250
to your x-box to whatever and the fact
that the matters as we move more and

162
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,740
more

163
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,800
this data to the cloud it means

164
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,740
governments and let against can go to
the clouding get that data

165
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,839
without ever coming to the city's the
question is is that the right place to

166
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,470
be

167
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,130
wanna the Center for Democracy and
technology has done some interesting

168
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,839
work looking at reforming the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act

169
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,320
but it will i think be a big issue for
social cloud acceptance

170
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,910
about whether not people one apart their
data
