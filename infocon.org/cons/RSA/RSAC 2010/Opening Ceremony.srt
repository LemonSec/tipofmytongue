it was English Parliament Thomas Young
however who first made headway

had a breakthrough

in which he understood the gym sacred

fascinating age world that might have
been forever

must time done

48
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,810
no one individual can take full credit
for this extraordinary feat to decipher

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,790
it took an international team brilliant
minds to solve one of history's most

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,070
fascinating to me

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,930
today the Rosetta Stone

52
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,610
is more than in each Mon it is a model
for the future

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,270
in average

54
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,360
it inspires us to work together on

that when we join forces

we are stronger safe and smart
