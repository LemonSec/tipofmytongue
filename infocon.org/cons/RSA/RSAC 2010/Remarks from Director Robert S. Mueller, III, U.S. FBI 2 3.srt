1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,089
some industry have liken this to death
by a thousand cuts

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,880
we are bleeding data intellectual
property

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,840
information source code bit by bit

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,929
and in some cases terabyte by terabyte

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,240
but the solution does not rest solely
with better ways to detect

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,720
and block improve in the camps we are
playing

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,010
the cyber equivalent of cat and mouse
and unfortunately the now seems to be

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,700
one step ahead most I've the time we
must work together to find those

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,700
responsible must make the cost of doing
business more than they are willing

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,710
to bear we in the FBI

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,879
pursuit cyber threat from start to
finish we have cyber squad to each of

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,170
our 56 field offices around the country

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,620
with more than 1,000 specially trained
agents

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,620
analysts and digital forensic examiners

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,920
together they run complex undercover

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,119
undercover operations and examine
digital evidence

17
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,409
they share information with our law
enforcement and intelligence partners

18
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,580
including the secret service which also
has strong capabilities

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,920
in this area and the teacher counterpart

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,270
both at home and abroad how best

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,590
to investigate cyber threats but

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,479
the FBI not do it alone we have the
National Cyber task force that we

23
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,610
stood up which include seventeen law
enforcement and intelligence agencies

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,750
working side by side to identify key
players

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,799
in schemes nicole is goal is to predict

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,270
and prevent what is on the horizon in to
pursue

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,759
the enterprises behind these attacks the
task force operates through

28
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,350
refuge in cells smaller group A agents

29
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,390
officers an analyst from different
agencies focused on particular

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,649
threats as an example the botnet

31
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,180
fusion our focus L investigate
high-priority

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,090
but maps we are reverse engineering
those botnet with an eye towards

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,230
disrupting them

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,739
and we are following the money wherever
it leads to find

35
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,660
and stop the bot masters this week's
takedown america owes a botnet

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,580
by ourselves in the Spanish is but one
example

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,860
up that collaboration as you may know

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,349
map poster was information stealing
botnet

39
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,370
when that infected millions of computers
from

40
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,120
fortune 1000 companies two major banks
in this case like so many others

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,650
emphasize the need for global
cooperation

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,569
we now have more than 60 FBI

43
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,110
attache offices around the world sharing
information and coordinating joint

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,110
investigations

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,720
with our host countries we are special
agents embedded with police forces in

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,629
Romania

47
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,220
estonia benevolent just a name a few

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,400
and together we are making progress

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,090
last october we worked with Egyptian
authorities to dismantle a computer

50
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,090
intrusion

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,030
and money laundering scheme operating in
both the United States

52
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,480
and Egypt with our partners

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,000
in the United Kingdom Germany and Turkey
we dismantled

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,150
dark market what are the most
sophisticated

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,810
online criminal syndicates and 10 the
forerunners in using the internet to buy

56
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,580
and sell

57
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,150
stolen financial data and we have work
with the Romanian national police to

58
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,670
arrest more than 100

59
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,970
Romanian Nationals in the past eighteen
months

60
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,810
four years ago several american
companies threatened to cut cyber times

61
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,890
with Romania

62
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,640
because %uh the ramp attacking
originating from that country

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,280
and yet today Romania is one of our
strongest

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,510
partners these cases per cent

65
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,519
unique hurdles and terms are
jurisdiction and prosecution

66
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,790
we see borders as obstacles whereas
criminal see them

67
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,560
as opportunities but together we must

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,210
continue to work towards and
international standard for cybercrime

69
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,160
and we must continue to press forward
country by country

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,430
and cockney by Copley

71
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,169
in recent years we have investigated a
number of cases where

72
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,530
financial institutions have been
breached with losses

73
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,460
in the tens of millions you've likely
heard about

74
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,750
the recent global bank ice where the
hackers broke through and

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,560
encrypt it system to steal account
numbers and pintos

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,639
they created more than 400 fake ATM
cards

77
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,970
and recruited hundreds of mules from
around the world

78
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,460
just 24 hours in roughly 280 cities

79
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,910
they stole nearly 10 million dollars

80
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,100
the loss was limited only by the number
of yours

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,820
and the cash in the ATM machine

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,900
this was a revolutionary attack in terms
of minutes

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,440
sophistication and success but our
approach to finding those responsible

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,920
West revolutionary as well them

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,200
first and foremost

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,760
the cup me came forward quickly which
was a great help to us

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,120
we deployed a mobile FBI cyber Action
Team a highly

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,380
train group world agents analysts and
experts in both computer forensics

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,500
and malicious code these teams travel
the world on a moment's notice to

90
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,740
respond to fast-moving cyberthreats

91
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,240
such as this one we work closely with
our counterparts here at home and

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,290
overseas to investigate the attack

93
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,490
and we alerted our private sector
partners to the potential danger

94
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,280
so they could make the necessary patches
and today as a result of those efforts

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,630
the top three hackers behind his
attacker in custody in eastern europe

96
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,590
but the simple truth is if this company
had not come forward

97
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,090
we would not have been able to stop
these individuals from hitting

98
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,130
the next victim this is where we can be
a value not just in finding these

99
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,920
criminals but

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,640
in making certain they cannot get to you
in the first place

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,730
and if we cannot prevent every attack we
must stop them from striking

102
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,600
again and again and to do that we need
your help

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,740
so let me again emphasize the importance
a private sector partnerships

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,500
historically there has been a dichotomy
between network security

105
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,320
on the one hand and the investigator
process

106
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,600
on the other it has been the Great
Divide

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,640
between us but it needn't be we in the
FBI understand

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,210
that you have practical concerns about
reporting

109
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,780
reaches up security you may believe that
notifying the authorities will

110
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,260
harm your competitive position in their
privacy concerns remain think that the

111
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,480
information flows

112
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,130
just one way and that is to us in tell
you we do not want you to feel

113
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,020
victimized a second time

114
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,790
by an investigation and we know that
putting on ray jackets courting the

115
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,360
media

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,460
and shutting down your systems is not
the best way to get the job done

117
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,570
we will minimize the disruption to your
business

118
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,729
we will safeguard your privacy and your
data

119
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,140
and where necessary we will seek
protective orders to preserve trade

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,840
secrets

121
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,100
and business company geology and we will
share

122
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,810
with you what we can as quickly as we
can about the means and the methods

123
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,130
up the attack as an example we recently
worked with our partners in the

124
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,930
financial sector to draft in

125
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,550
intelligence report on threat patterns
in certain

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,520
banking transactions we share that
report with more than 4,000 partners

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,810
and together we were to limit the
breadth endoscope

128
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,550
up this potential threat we close the
door to countless hackers

129
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,760
please remember that for every in

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,250
investigation in the news there are
hundreds that will never make the

131
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,080
headlines

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,500
we are generally behind the scenes
working to find those responsible

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,099
and disclosure is the exception not

134
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,219
the rule that said we cannot act

135
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,500
if we are not aware the problem and
maintaining a code of silence

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,900
will not benefit you or your clients in
the long run calls to mind the old

137
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,420
joke about two hikers in the forest to
run into a grizzly bear

138
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,589
first tiger says to the other we just
need to outrun him

139
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:01,630
the second replies I don't meet up on
him I just need to outrun

140
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,020
you them he may well outrun

141
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,020
that first attack but you aren't likely
to avoid the second to the third attack

142
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,310
and are set the air safety lies in
protecting not just our own interest but

143
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:21,080
are critical infrastructure as a whole
following World War one

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,050
France build a line of concrete
fortifications and machine gun nest

145
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,490
along its borders it was designed to
give the French army

146
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,870
time to mobilize in the event an attack
by Germany

147
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,260
the secondary motivation was to entice
Germany to attack Belgium

148
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,330
as the easier target

149
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,280
as we all know the match Milind held
strong for a brief time

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,020
however in the long run it did little
good

151
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,390
the germans invaded Belgium flank the
line and stormed

152
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,339
France so in the end I therefore
churches nor fortifications

153
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,000
stop Nazi Germany our success
