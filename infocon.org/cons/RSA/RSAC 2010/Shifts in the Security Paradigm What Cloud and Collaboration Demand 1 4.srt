1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,620
the afternoon and thank you for joining
me today

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,960
this is my third consecutive RCA
keynoter am very excited to be here

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,259
I it's a fantastic conference and we
really enjoy

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,190
be a big sponsor here today we want to
explore

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,930
be the challenge are is security

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,140
really an inhibitor to using the cloud
in a cloud adoption

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,330
if you read the press and the journals
in everything you read about today

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,099
you'll see that securities generally
identified as the number one issue

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,480
security compliance privacy

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,510
for people to really adoptees great new
services

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,829
so that will be exploring today in my
role prior to running CA security

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,390
business unit I was the CIO the company

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,500
and our chief security officer Bill
toppers in the audience today as well

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,870
if we go back three or four years bill
and I had summer challenges like we

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,680
wanted that

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,579
and evaluating you Software as a Service
we wanted to use remote host

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,719
applications

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,000
we started experimenting with Platform
as a Service

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,479
all very successfully we we've all been
doing this for a few years

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,540
it's not that this is all that new and
sometimes I think

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,490
we fail to communicate effectively that
we actually can do a lot of this

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,619
and maybe we need to the bong the myth
the legend that security is really this

23
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,710
inhibitor so today I am

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,150
we decided to go with the a
distinguished panel the really dive into

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,869
this issue

26
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,950
and the panel is diverse they come from
different backgrounds

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,829
someone panelists our cloud providers
summer cloud consumers

28
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,240
and summer both so we're gonna get their
insight

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,130
and we'll share that with you so afraid
I'd like to introduce our panel

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,840
first we have Tim Chrisman from axiom

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,000
next we have

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,399
Steve Riley from Amazon then Kurt obably

33
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,049
from Lockheed Martin and last but not
least

34
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,250
doctor Larry Parliament from the
parliament Institute

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,479
thanks guys so

36
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,430
I wanna turn it over to

37
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,490
Larry to kick things off larry is a a
very distinguished researcher

38
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,140
but well-recognized world-renowned misty
told me that in our interview

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,900
and yeah I I wanted to kick off the
dialogue by sharing with you some other

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,860
work in research that he's dime

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,349
and gotta start the juices going and
then we're gonna diving with the panel

42
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,020
with some

43
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,870
interesting questions the discuss and
debate so larry and thank you Dave

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
appreciated

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,069
and good afternoon everyone thank you
for staying late in listening to us I

46
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:32,730
think we have

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,150
I have some really interesting
information to share with you on

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,560
just and you know where in the repin a
min Institute Larry pondimin here

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,360
we basically do research very boring we
focus on things like information

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,069
security and we're very interested in
cloud computing security we're doing a

51
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,500
number of studies myspace

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,989
but is kind of interesting walking
through the exhibit hall

53
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,769
I saw on a hundred we counted that
scientifically after we've missed a few

54
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,330
but 127

55
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,920
different security products supposedly
dedicated to security in the cloud

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,300
so that I think it leading indicator
that we're onto something here that it

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,290
must be important

58
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,150
herein are both I was only in there for
I 127 messages on cloud computing

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,260
security

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,560
so but i wanna do is this sign tattoo is
it is like one picture is worth 1000

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,370
words he said that it was a

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,920
confucius said that but was kind of
interesting is that if you look at this

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,760
and you're on the high when you see this
sign you can have a heart attack because

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,220
he's just too much going on

65
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,659
and really when you think about the
issues that are keeping us

66
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,080
up at night from our cloud computing
prospective is really how insecure is

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,260
the cloud isn't as bad as people say it
is

68
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,000
or is it more fide appearance there in T
and doubt and so it's

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,989
just another security issue but not
worse than any up the gazillion

70
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,010
security issues that we have to deal
with every day another issue

71
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,390
can not cloud computing actually not
just diminish but

72
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,439
enhance the security posture that
organization is that possible

73
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,420
in a bit maybe very possible I'm how do
we had negotiate privacy and data

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,870
protection issues you know they heard
the privacy word

75
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,220
throughout this conference does it
become harder to

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,629
enable privacy to ensure compliance with
data protection was specially european

77
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,449
allies your data transfer

78
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,259
lies who is responsible for security the
company the vendor

79
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,860
on the IT gurus in an organization are
they

80
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,449
do we become less important ways it
really an end-user

81
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,669
responsibility how do we respond today
to live to date if after data breach in

82
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,650
the cloud

83
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,300
we have more make it data breaches
because we'll have more data

84
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,970
that can be lost or stolen I what
security trumpet

85
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,449
technologies transfer in the cloud and
what technologies are going to be left

86
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,300
behind

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,530
because they don't transfer to the cloud
is security as a service

88
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,500
is it is a big one is it economically
viable I mean we think it is but it will

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,889
it actually create enough

90
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,169
positive economics to now find
investment

91
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,020
in better technology and less than but
not least in this map here

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,330
is while protecting the cloud leave us
vulnerable to other areas

93
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,320
I mean are we gonna nor other important
pieces the security puzzle

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,539
so hopefully we'll learn a panel
discussion will answer most these

95
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,310
questions

96
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,130
actually next five minutes great thank
you larry take that from me

97
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,870
on so when we look at

98
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,860
II the the panel had not Steve here from

99
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,229
Amazon and an Steve that runs around the
world be in an evangelist for security

100
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,410
and for at

101
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,350
a Amazon Services and ec2 is it is a
great

102
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,690
service you guys offer I know we use
every many things like testing were

103
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,639
doing there

104
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,039
on so do you think that security is a
bear ears the for people to adopt those

105
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,759
services

106
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,789
I think people think it's a barrier a
mostly from

107
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,639
just not having a complete understanding
love how a cloud

108
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,449
environment might look a lot like the
existing environment they have and how

109
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:02,870
it differs from

110
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,699
from traditional IT environment so a
large part of my job

111
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,520
is to help people understand what we're
doing

112
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,650
to protect the infrastructure to protect
customers from each other to

113
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,389
provide high degrees have compute and
storage isolation

114
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,389
a.m. but in many respects I i think that

115
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,350
much of what we've all learned as
security practitioners

116
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,380
overtime applies to the cloud as well
simply giving up ownership for the

117
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,979
infrastructure does not mean you have to
give up on a ship that the data

118
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,440
and with appropriate controls like
encryption

119
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,410
right security standards and things like
that we can still maintain that

120
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,630
that that ownership for the information
right and that's what do I think ski on

121
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,120
on the transparency is is key
transparency Eagles trust

122
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,789
and one of the things I think we could
all help each other out with this kinda

123
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,800
demystifying this whole cloud where

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,289
I think there's a general perception
that there's this big a more precise

125
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,410
cloud that doesn't really be you know
isn't really cable cuz my

126
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,580
anything but there's private clouds and
public cloud and hybrid cloud

127
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,900
and there isn't anybody that would ever
offer up their IT security

128
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,220
order compliance properties to say one's
gonna put up in the clouds I think

129
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,810
there's a

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,900
a bit of an educational that to you guys
transparency Eagle stress I think

131
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,190
more transparent cloud providers can be
you'll see more more customers adopt

132
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,090
that's great not Kurt down you run that

133
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,050
an amazing center in maryland the the
NextGen cybersecurity center

134
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,229
that protects love the infrastructure
the US I

135
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,319
lucky margins is really a global
security

136
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,470
leader and you miss a lot of customers
you're managing supporting

137
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,990
defense customers watch their customers
what's your reaction

138
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,050
in from the federal government site and
how they're adopting things is there a

139
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,509
fear from the federal government to the
hide of so many services and use them

140
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,080
what are your thoughts on that so we're
very very customer focused a

141
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,930
in their customers have a diverse set of
missions they understand their missions

142
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,229
that they have

143
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,940
you can see whether some concerning
clout right but when you look at

144
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,960
certain missions they have like
confident facing

145
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,360
missions on EPA Eric and get on a a
cloud over the PA

146
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,650
you can find out all kinds information
to be about you know

147
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,160
buyer knows where you are right in one
of our customers

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,389
I've been working with remains proud
example week

149
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,979
but I secure cloud private cloud inside
the printer

150
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,339
and when we looked at certain workload
it makes sense to keep it there

151
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,860
but another workload they had some
interplanetary imagery that unlike whole

152
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,479
week

153
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,620
to do what they needed internally right
but when they

154
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,950
went out to the cloudburst to ec2 over a
weekend

155
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,570
about six hours they got the same thing
done and that was dated that was going

156
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,060
to happen in the public so

157
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,220
you understand average profile then you
can start managing that fear

158
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,170
excellent Solari did a little research
on are different groups whether the

159
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,779
federal government to keep their
commercial markets

160
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,890
on what do you see news is there a
difference in the responses from

161
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,180
the government people versus the
commercial sector folks that's kind of

162
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,360
interesting we just had a steady and
involved executives in the

163
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,649
federal government its final government
is federal government departments and

164
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:16,820
agencies

165
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,970
and we were fun we we found some
uninteresting

166
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,910
findings with respect to cloud computing
I think we were not dazzled by am

167
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,959
as we work a little surprise that cloud
computing as a security risk

168
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,620
rain before and have 12 it doesn't mean
that's not in it thats

169
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,720
that's still suggest it's really
significant but there are other issues

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,630
that were viewed as much more

171
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,800
pressing a much more important will have
another study

172
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,350
look that folks who are at a lower level
in the same governmental organizations

173
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,740
here

174
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,240
we call people folks in the trenches
folks like unis

175
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,100
these people looked at the same security
risk in actually put cloud computing in

176
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,820
a much higher level so I've year

177
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,649
the wrong where they know something that
the Chiefs the senior-level

178
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,880
folks are now where okay
