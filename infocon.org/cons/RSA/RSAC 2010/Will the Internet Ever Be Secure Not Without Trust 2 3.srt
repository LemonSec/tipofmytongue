1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,610
I'm to us an intimate group up security
professionals

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,890
should be a pretty small group of people
man I walk out here and I see that we

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,250
need to put in early for the table

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,150
up like a lot of view I operated
infrastructure

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,950
we consider that a critical
infrastructure many have you consider

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,789
what we run critical infrastructure

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,510
now critical infrastructure means
different things to different people

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,109
but for the purposes of the internet DNS
is pretty critical that's one of the

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,140
things that we provide

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,400
now the things to keep me awake at night

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,809
are the same things that keep you awake
at night I have to protect my network

12
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,860
I have to deliver those services I have
to do it seamlessly and efficiently and

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,190
I have to be able to do it

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,020
in a way that my customers never see any
impact as ever

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,010
failure have any sort of server fails to
drive fails power goes out in a building

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,660
at center

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,030
these are the same kinds of things that
you have to worry about we do is on

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,879
so that our customers can trust our
services

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,920
if you couldn't trust that we could
deliver certificate revocation list

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,000
earlier we can deliver a DNS entry

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,580
I'm to you I'm then you would look for
another provider for that service

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,979
all of us here to one degree or another

23
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,530
trust some cloud based service you have
to you whether a private cloud

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,200
from services that you built a cloud you
build within your own

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,799
environment for their services that you
get from somewhere else now

26
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,320
over the last couple years as this whole
concept of cloud computing has become

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,590
more of a buzz word that has a
functional

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,920
element of our infrastructure but the
reality is that we all do you something

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,880
we have to use 'em

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,600
but we have to find ways to trust

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
a broader set of services that are
migrating to the cloud

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,130
every time we turn around we find out
someone is moving

33
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,579
yet another kind of service that we used
to do exclusively

34
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,290
on our own premises we now are trying to
migrate to a cloud we have to

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,430
and we or we're creating a cloud for now
here's a dilemma that we had a couple

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,240
years ago

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,750
this was a pretty serious situation we
had a number data centers around the

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,189
world

39
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,060
all of which could come under attack at
any given point in time and we need to

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,860
protect those because the knowledge
service tax are serious

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,959
and they were threatening the health
love our services if we couldn't

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,950
if we could start keep our services
available wall while we're under attack

43
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,040
our customers didn't really care what I
was going to have to do to protect that

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,970
what they cared about was three things
was a secure was a reliable and wasn't

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,810
going to scale

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,110
with the growth of the Internet so
whatever I had to do to protect those

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,900
services

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,629
I had to do and I couldn't exactly go
tell them what I was going to do

49
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,599
on simply because he didn't care they
didn't care what i was gonna do that in

50
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,060
care how much it was going to cost

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,739
didn't care about any of that but what
they need to know is that they could

52
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,810
trust that the service was going to be
available so to provide a level of trust

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,909
I had to consider key sex 817 data
centers

54
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,209
we had $75 plus point to present at that
time

55
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,260
they were all vulnerable to a denial of
service attack

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,310
if we didn't provision sufficiently or
provide the proper equipment incapacity

57
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,940
to deal with it and the price tag

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,379
for providing all those appliances the
traditional way of dealing with

59
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,629
denial-of-service attacks

60
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,390
the the price tag for applying all

61
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,310
those appliances all those locations and
then over provisioning the van with

62
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,310
sufficiently

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,920
to be able to withstand the largest
attack I would expect to see

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,269
at that data center was gonna cost me
about thirty million dollars and that's

65
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,000
pretty expensive but I can tell you that

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,409
you guys out our customers didn't really
care how much of that was gonna cost me

67
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,489
which you cared

68
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,510
was at the service was going to be up
when it was available so we had to

69
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,500
abandon the traditional approach

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,420
to dealing with denial-of-service
attacks in in other words we were gonna

71
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,030
brute force this problem

72
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,250
at every single data center we were
going to replicate all that

73
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,000
a couple things we could have done we
can reduce the number of data centers

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,790
that we had but that was impossible

75
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,390
at least not at that time we could have

76
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,170
ran at risk in just said you know will
will with will weather the storm if we

77
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,019
have to

78
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:18,009
I'm and then we'll just say we were
sorry later on that was an option

79
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,150
so we really just went back to the white
board we we thought

80
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,060
how we were going to deal with the Nile
service attacks how we were gonna deal

81
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,669
with the overwhelming costs that it was
going to take it to deal with them

82
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,910
so we came up with another solution we
essentially created a private cloud

83
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,000
which would allow us tour to put all of
the brute force

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,400
in just a few areas in just a few of the
data centers

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,650
and then whenever one of the other data
centers was under attack we could

86
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,479
redirect traffic through

87
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,040
the data center scrub that traffic to
follow the bad traffic

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,250
and let only the good traffic make its
way onto the other data centers

89
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,419
that work pretty well and turned out to
be much much more cost-effective

90
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,990
and we were able to to essentially say
that thirty million dollars

91
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,500
and provide every bit as good a service

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,870
but at a much lower cost now I would
argue that when it comes to

93
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,990
denial-of-service mitigation

94
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,560
I really don't want that bad traffic in
my data center to begin with

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,620
I would I would argue that for dial
service mitigation

96
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,840
in the cloud is really the only way can
be done properly

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,919
now that worked out so well that we
ultimately wound up making making that a

98
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,639
I'm

99
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,110
a service that we offer to our customers
now

100
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,070
it really is for not just for cloud
providers but for anyone to provide the

101
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,560
service

102
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,470
it's about trust it's not just about all
that gadgets that you put all the

103
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,389
firewalls that you put in

104
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,539
how many servers that you put behind it
how much you weigh goes into your

105
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,690
software

106
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,000
all that stuff adds up ultimately and
rolls up to trust

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,060
but in and of itself none of those
things actually provide trust

108
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,919
people want to know can they rely on the
service if I'm buying a service from you

109
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,419
can I rely on we're restoring my data

110
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,860
because I have to account for my date if
I think data is missing or corrupt or

111
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,630
what have you

112
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,810
I need to go find it somewhere and also
need to make sure that you're not

113
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,319
yet again outsourcing the storage at my
data somewhere else and possibly

114
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,030
violating my compliant

115
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,800
guy need to know is a service secure
it's a component it's not the only

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,340
reason I'm going to select that service

117
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,780
is always going to be on backing up my
data how are you are dedicating other

118
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,000
users on the system

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,300
can other users see my data what have
you done to make sure

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,039
that the tenants on that platform can
see one another's day

121
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,789
and also need to know whether complies
with my government smile because now

122
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,830
1 I'm audited you're gonna be audited to
some degree or another

123
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,220
so all week long I'm sure that this is
probably the first time you heard

124
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,960
anything about cloud computing

125
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,240
this week the reality is everyone's
talking about it

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,849
everyone's touting how wonderful it is
how great it is how cost-effective that

127
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,740
it is

128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,690
if that's the case then why is everybody
doing already if it's so obvious

129
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,460
why isn't everybody already doing pretty
simple

130
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,030
they don't trust in many ways they
simply

131
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,940
don't trust they really only trust
themselves

132
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,479
they will go to great lengths and spend
a lot more money to run it

133
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,930
themselves in their own environment
knowing full well that outsourcing a

134
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,639
service

135
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,900
could be more cost effective in could be
cheaper they simply don't trust it

136
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,560
and the more critical that services to
their operations

137
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,190
the more critical the trustees to that
now I've talked a little bit about sorta

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,470
you know what we do is the provider of
services

139
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,169
but what really matters and the reason
why most

140
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,970
you would care why the services are up
and why you would want russia services

141
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,910
because you want your customers and you
want the consumer

142
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,319
to trust they care but they don't care
what kinda firewalls are you still care

143
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,729
how many servers I have

144
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,110
they just care that the service is a
picture that your services up

145
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,319
an order for your service to be up mine
has to be a now

146
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,259
to talk about the consumer site at this
and the experience to this

147
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,599
like to bring out Fran Rosch is our
senior BP

148
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,599
for authentication business ramp the

149
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,920
thank you can

150
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,430
good afternoon everyone here it's great
to be here at the art a conference 2010

151
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,040
have an opportunity to talk to you
briefly this afternoon as can talk about

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,420
for CIO's in CT owes there's still a lot
of challenging trust

153
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,110
for them to be able to start really
adopting the cloud and using all the

154
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,080
capabilities that are there for the
having

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,470
in the short time that I have to be this
afternoon i turn on a Segway away from

156
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,480
the OC to:

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,530
CIO issues in focus on the trust
challenges

158
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,420
a bindle individual enterprise users
employees in our company's

159
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,420
as well as consumers out there on the
internet I've had a a good opportunity

160
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,430
over the past couple days to attend a
lot attempt will sessions here they are:

161
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,350
say conference

162
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,540
and it's amazing to hear all the updates
and all the different malicious behavior

163
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,210
that's continuing to grow out there and
the networks in the public Internet

164
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,350
things like by and armies and the word
tax

165
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,530
any PT's and web now where it's clear

166
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,320
at the Internet is continuing to grow
continuing to be a scary place

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,050
for people to be able to transact in
work was also great to be able to go and

168
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,940
spend some time

169
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,800
on the expo floor and see all the
different companies out there

170
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
both large and small for developing
technologies to be able to combat the

171
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,030
growth in this malicious

172
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,580
code cell even though our our problems
arising

173
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,090
so our solutions however individual

174
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,880
users of our employees are companies and
consumers out there on the internet

175
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,970
certainly knocking off
