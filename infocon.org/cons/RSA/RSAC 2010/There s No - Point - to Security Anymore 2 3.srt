1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,000
a critical access to information trying
to understand who can access these

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,730
critical

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,099
repositories so they could invoke kinda
social engineering

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,750
leveraging these types of tools to go
after spearfishing

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,630
some kinda communication to these pipes
a Q+A your quality assurance type

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,350
personnel

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,320
so they can essentially initiate attack
towards them in a highly coordinated way

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,330
to do a couple thanks get the mound
where

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,490
into the system leverage it by enabling
them

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,230
to go after infect them by getting them
go to website

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,260
in this case a Taiwanese website

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,290
that eventually loaded down JavaScript
code

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,890
that JavaScript code then enable the Jay
pag

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,629
disguised as a binary that eventually
ran an executed

15
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,750
very powerful complex attack vector now

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,079
that exploited a major vulnerability but
at the same time

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,190
leverage spearfishing as a major
mechanism for doing so

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,130
alternately ending up with copper

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,939
opening up sports SSL like protocol port

20
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,310
took command and control centre that
enable long-term persistent threat

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,780
observations I critical assets in the
infrastructure

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,860
this one on for many many months

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,310
very very difficult type attack vectors
to resolve because it wasn't just the

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,060
malware

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,979
that was sitting on these endpoints
combination of understanding the threat

26
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:31,900
at the network

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,689
believing in many cases the two factor
authentication

28
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,930
into the network was enough what was the
reality here

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,560
many the source code control systems
were wide open

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,259
once they were in the network and we're
leveraging credentials

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,750
a key employees in the company they were
able to observe for a long period of

32
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,189
time

33
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,920
why is that the source code control
systems

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,969
unencrypted traffic between client and
server

35
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:02,240
basic username and password loggins

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,770
very very little capabilities for
security once inside the network

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,569
are most critical infrastructure assets
were being protected

38
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,000
ability to go in and have admin rights

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,440
on a source code repository that
essentially could turn of archiving and

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,099
auditing

41
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,020
on a critical asset and no one
understood who changed what and what

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,140
one's a source code

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,209
pretty interesting attack vector so
we're seeing new types of threats

44
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,220
occurring combinations for the Korean 42
July attack

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,420
combinations Aurora a really creating
new ways that we have to think about

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,730
solving for x

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,620
we have to advance our technology we
have to think it each step for these

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,340
attacks

49
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,970
what to do what to look for and how to
be smarter about the problems were see

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,730
thinking about step one how do we
understand where this phone ability

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,590
could exist

52
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,290
with now more than a hundred companies
affected by this alone

53
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,110
we're seeing and learning that we have
to understand the boner billion our

54
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,840
enterprise

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,659
the risk to that vulnerability and very
quickly be able to react to it

56
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,819
so technologies like vulnerability
management risk advising

57
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,980
the ability to understand web security
through the Internet Explorer critical

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,440
in that first step to block it

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,879
we had educate these technologies from
the cloud

60
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
same one step too how do we begin to
understand as JoePa got loaded

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,640
how to block it how to prevent that from
occurring again

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,510
on-premise technology talking to a cloud
intelligence repository was critical

63
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,010
here to stop these attacks

64
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,159
on the first day each step up there were
attacked had different things that we

65
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,049
could learn

66
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,519
on how to do it probably the most
important thing that we learned

67
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,200
in addition to the source code control
systems being very own secure

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,830
was data loss prevention products were
absolutely critical in these cases

69
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,400
how do we make sure for the network and
through the host

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,930
that we have policies in place not just
for credit card numbers

71
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,129
PIII type date or a PC I typed data

72
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,319
really for our most critical assets
source code

73
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,970
confidential data assets trying to make
sure we've classified them

74
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,979
could do blocking in detecting at the
protocols

75
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,600
through the gateways to make sure
nothing could leave

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,850
if we had an appt inside the
organization

77
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,000
interesting things to learn each of
these examples that are critical

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,630
to the strategy is moving forward I
think for all of us

79
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,850
let's take a look a little bit for a
minute here's the basic problem we see

80
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,940
as a company protection gap

81
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,509
we know this too anti-virus product
blacklisting products we have to fix

82
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,680
this gap

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
what happens today all know this it
takes a long time

84
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,930
when mauer is discovered in the wild all
the way through toll protections

85
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,990
available

86
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,880
from a vendor took its downloaded
deployed remediated

87
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,300
and it just too wide a gap certain
applications are fine for this but we

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
need a management

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,910
that can really close this gap really 20

90
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,470
the technology is existing today the
ability now to happen all the time

91
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,600
real time now we're management system is
there

92
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,380
we can close this gap down to really
milliseconds at this point

93
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,479
when we think about our strategy at
McAfee here's what we're trying to do

94
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,770
it's all about global threat
intelligence

95
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,620
we're really focused 100 percent on one
major problem at this point

96
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,380
how to have the smartest intelligence
repository in the clap

97
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,030
we initially launched our big solution
called Artemis

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,580
Artemis now has tens of millions of
computing devices communicating to it

99
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,009
and we learned a lot in the first phase
cloud intelligence report

100
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,210
and now we're taking it to the next
level whole idea is creating

101
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,470
intelligence into

102
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,360
moving from defense in depth multi
products

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,060
multilayers defense to really
intelligence across all those layers

104
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,210
most critical piece what are the three
components of this

105
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,780
the first one it has to be real time

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,509
we have to create a private-public
partnership as well as private the

107
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,750
private partnerships that allow us to do
real time

108
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,139
communications between premise-based
solutions in the cloud

109
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,020
measured in milliseconds I receive a
file on email

110
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,710
I get a file on a USB stick how quick

111
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,160
can I look that up in the cloud see if
i've seen it before

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,090
see if it's bad and respond in
quarantine not file

113
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,270
even if there's not a signature for it
somewhere in the cloud with all that

114
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,009
content before

115
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,099
we can stop it or at least warn the user
that it's there

116
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,830
real time access is absolutely critical
for the next wave

117
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,199
the second major thing reputation
services

118
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,729
we have to evolve to the point we have
reputation-based

119
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,729
no longer is yes and no good enough
should we allow the final ensure we

120
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,050
blocked the file

121
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,380
we need to learn the behaviors of the
content

122
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,220
the applications the user and really
understand the environment they're

123
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,800
worried

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,650
how do we understand that an IP address
the 2011 Korean IP address

125
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,889
was very bad address how do we
understand how to make sure that we can

126
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,729
create a reputation to that

127
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,009
that was a very high-risk reputation for
URL address

128
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,680
real time and reputation on the last
component that's key

129
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,300
in our opinion is the cuts across
specter's its interlocked

130
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,979
trying to create this intelligence as a
Service

131
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,490
intelligence in the squad service so
that we can drive it to every vector

132
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,690
across your enterprise that Victor could
be an ATM machine

133
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,340
police still register that Victor could
be a PC

134
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,379
mobile phone an appliance anything that
allows us to communicate that advice

135
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,910
and interlocking and do it across the
whole enterprise quickly and efficiently

136
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,449
so somebody asked me what are we trying
to build that McAfee there it is

137
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,069
very powerful real time back in
reputation system

138
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,379
that is very interlock with everything
that we do

139
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,979
let's take a minute look here's the
major problem we keep see

140
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,280
this past year had a mini these exploits
occur

141
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,769
we had lots of layers a difference
defense in depth has been our strategy

142
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,490
for some time

143
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,820
but the point products were
communicating there's no we're

144
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,029
operability between them

145
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,399
the email filtered and talk to the web
filtered and talk to the far wall didn't

146
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,779
talk to the endpoint

147
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,000
and talk to the risk management score
and we couldn't solve problems

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,149
the attacks that we're gonna see in 2010

149
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,250
he had to be solved by integrating these
technologies together

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,140
has to happen just absolutely has to
happen

151
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,390
or we will find holes in architecture
everywhere

152
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,070
and we are so the key here is to really
create an architecture that allows us

153
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,760
the crate single agents integrated
across the white family features and

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
functions

155
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,399
things like blacklisting whitelisting
encryption

156
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,490
data loss prevention host intrusion
network emission controls

157
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,440
forensics it could be any number
features packed into an agent that can

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,540
communicate

159
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,000
together and cooperate together

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,130
this is a critical component that the
engine should be everywhere

161
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,980
want every type of device

162
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,910
these agents exist today and we can
leverage

163
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,180
the second major thing we've got to be
thinking about is how to manage it all

164
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,519
we think about this a single agent
single consul

165
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,029
but not just the agents on the end
