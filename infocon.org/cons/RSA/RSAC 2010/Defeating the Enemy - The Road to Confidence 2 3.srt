1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,889
in must be protected and as much as we
tell employees that they can't put

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,180
information on the Internet

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,280
it will happen and what we can control.
perhaps

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,630
a little bit of what they say about our
company's but they're not able but we're

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,320
not able to do is control what they say
about themselves

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,850
now ubiquitous connectivity cloud
computing

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,710
digital devices and social networking
all put information at our fingertips

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,000
at our fingertips and they

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,439
changing how we think about it.
accelerate the needy

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,440
for us to take information centric view

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,870
to security and that is the theme
everything that I'm covering

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,700
if I'm organizations are going to be
successful

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,280
we need to adopt new approaches to
securing storing

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,780
and managing information the independent
up where the information lives or what

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,989
device it's on

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,059
or what employees is communicating with
other people

17
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,250
in the industry around the world the
other thing that we know is that

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,460
cybercriminals

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,609
and hackers are more determined than
ever to steal confidential information

20
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,670
these attacks are shifting from being
broad-based

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,689
to being very targeted since 2006

22
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,060
we have been predicting that these
highly targeted attacks

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,880
be silent threats would go after
confidential information

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,100
our 2010 state

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,750
enterprise security report we surveyed
2100 CIO's

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,250
CIS does and IT managers came back some
very clear data

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,680
over the last 12 months 75 percent

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,750
the companies in a survey have had a
cyberattack

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,409
the same study found that a hundred
percent

30
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,869
ABI survey respondents had experienced a
cyber loss in 2009

31
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,840
now that loss could come from an
external attacker

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,920
a malicious insider or a well-meaning
insider but we know that the target was

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,000
always the same

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,140
it was information now the top three
losses they reported

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,320
first the theft of intellectual property
second

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,329
they talked about stealing financial
data or credit card data

37
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,440
and not lastly we talked about that I've
customer PIII

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,569
but what's dramatic to me is that a
hundred percent

39
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,030
the 2100 company surveyed said they'd
had

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,470
a cyber loss now

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,020
we've been saying that these attacks
would absolutely become targeted

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,860
and hide rack brought that point home it
target specific companies

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,739
across the world and look for
confidential information

44
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,349
it leverages zero-day vulnerability and
I E and used 250 cated social

45
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,080
engineering techniques and tactics

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,910
to distribute its payload what we saw

47
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,330
was that I am with malicious links or
emails

48
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,420
with PDF attachment and malware embedded
inside them was the way

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,290
but the attackers got into the
organization they also targeted

50
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,720
specific individuals inside a specific
companies

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,010
and a back door ultimately made it
possible for them to get

52
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,120
free access to a lot of the information
inside

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,750
their target companies and what were
they trying to steal clearly

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,830
it was the lateral property and
information inside those companies

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,500
our traditional signature-based
approaches to security

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,390
are not keeping up in 2008 we had to
produce 1.6

57
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,400
million signatures that's more than the
previous 17 years combined

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,500
in 2009 we had to produce 2.9 almost
doubling

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,060
the previous year so what we've had to
do

60
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,489
has come up with a new approach an
approach that we call reputation-based

61
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,470
security

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,989
the idea is it has to be able to deal
with

63
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,010
attacks that we've never seen target it

64
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,010
targeting attacks that have been
previously unseen

65
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,090
a reputation-based security will
leverage

66
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,280
the wisdom the knowledge the tens of
millions of users

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,540
use our products around the world
reputation-based security is based on a

68
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,239
few simple characteristics

69
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,730
origin age in the program and prevalence

70
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,510
would bring that together with other
information we have about the program's

71
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,629
and we can create a reputation today we
have over one billion

72
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:14,840
reputation ratings in the last six
months we've had a 177 billion

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,199
queries to our reputation database we
believe that this is the only approach

74
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,220
today

75
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,580
that can be used to detect is highly
targeted

76
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,810
attacks and we're seeing great results
we launched

77
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,419
in our consumer 2009 products this new
technology and one

78
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,889
in every 2pcs detected a previously
unknown threat that was five hundred

79
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,380
thousand threats

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,639
on the first day well we also have seen

81
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,790
is it back gave us a 15 percent increase
in detection

82
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,250
on the first day now this new technology

83
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,020
was designed specifically with hydro act
like a tax in mind

84
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,410
and we believe that these attacks will
continue to spread and become much more

85
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,320
targeted

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
now we're using this technology today on
a PC platform

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,770
it's not just gonna be limited to PCs it
will also help secure

88
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,490
a range of mobile devices because we
know

89
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,110
there what actors do is they target
platforms and devices

90
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,669
achieve critical mass sort only a matter
of time

91
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,270
before they'll come after whatever is
the latest new technology where

92
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,840
information is being stored

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,449
in 2009 we saw the first real attacks on
smartphones

94
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,139
the sexy space warm about basically
targeted

95
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,090
the Symbian OS platform using a
text-based

96
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,060
messaging approach to spreading but we
also know

97
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,770
is that while these devices are becoming
targeted we're also saying that there's

98
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,910
an increase

99
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,370
in the riser insiders people Hui

100
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,050
have come to trust they're stealing
information

101
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,449
we're also starting to see that the
malicious insiders are being able to

102
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:54,120
embed

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,780
significant new malware in our
environments that can create

104
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,930
opportunities

105
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,960
not only for information did the actual
trade at the organization

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,030
but also to create the potential for
other

107
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,360
future access points to be used now the
question I pose ta love you is

108
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,580
how do you know that an individual who
sits

109
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,199
next to you back in the office or here
today

110
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,410
is not masquerading as a trusted
employee

111
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,960
who is only planning when bill attack

112
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,220
the answers you don't know ultimately
you can never be sure

113
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,520
who you can trust his threat to real

114
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,120
in the trends continue to make it clear

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,759
that we need to be more careful the
information that we create

116
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,490
now let's look at the requirements we're
seeing is the change around

117
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,750
cloud computing mobile devices and
social networking

118
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,259
what do we need to do about security
well we think that they're all 24 keep

119
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,120
things that have to happen

120
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
the first is we have to move security
much closer

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,940
to the applications and to the data in a
shared infrastructure

122
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,199
it's not sufficient to share to protect
the clout perimeter

123
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,630
the data center the server or restore
direct we have to think about

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,419
how do we protect the entire environment
in a highly virtualized

125
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,889
multi-tenant environment what becomes
important

126
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,900
is we have to think about specific
applications we have to think about the

127
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,000
virtual machines

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,430
we have to think about the stored by and
that are associated with each individual

129
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,090
customer

130
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,599
for example with today we were to scan
every virtual machine to detect if there

131
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,250
was any malware

132
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,630
that would potentially bring down the
entire server so there's some simple

133
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,750
things that we can do

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,870
we can start staggering the scans we can
start thinking about how we create

135
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,419
what we call a single instance security
module

136
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,680
that means a single-engine that means a
single instanceof the content

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,000
it drives those engines means a single
set up update

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,280
regardless of how many virtual machines
you currently running on

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,490
the goal is to infuse security into the
whole virtual infrastructure

140
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,900
second automatically protect everything
that you're doing

141
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,319
last october we delivered a new
technology that we called file store

142
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,479
which is a cloud-based storage product
that makes it possible for you create

143
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:14,669
cost-effective

144
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,750
scaleable storage services but most
importantly

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,729
we infused with the endpoint security
technology because it became clear

146
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,430
the storage system without embedded
security was ultimately not going to be

147
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,430
secure

148
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,479
and these are just examples of how we're
moving

149
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,010
security closer to the applications
closer to the data

150
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,219
next you must have and information

151
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,440
governance model you must define it

152
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,140
you must but procedures in place you
must educate your

153
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,810
and most importantly you have to enforce
it

154
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,290
it's easy for me to say and much harder
to do

155
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,769
I've talked a lot subsea ISO's across
the world

156
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,070
and what they worry about is that the
information that their organizations are

157
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,670
creating

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,600
will be strewn across the internet and
they've ultimately

159
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,830
lost control but they're still
accountable

160
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,120
for the protection their organizations
this is a real issue

161
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,690
and so we've got to do speak about how
do we keep

162
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,700
the user's from doing and and run

163
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,600
around the IT organization we have to
have a new approach

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,480
so how should we respond at this point

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,110
putting an ass a lame place is an
important first step as we vet cloud

166
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,850
providers

167
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,330
is a series of questions that we can ask
that allow us to determine

168
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,130
if then you take the right steps to
protect our information

169
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,260
but we need to know is where is that
information gonna be

170
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,330
who's gonna have access to it where is
it

171
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,480
how often is accessed and so we've got
to do

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,500
is put in place the appropriate tools
and technology to allow sensitive

173
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,080
information from being removed

174
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,980
two years ago here at the arse a
conference we spent a lot of time

175
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,420
talking about data loss prevention

176
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,730
and that was an important step we need
to do a lot more
