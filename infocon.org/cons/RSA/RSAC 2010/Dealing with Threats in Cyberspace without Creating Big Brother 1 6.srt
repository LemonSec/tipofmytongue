00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,669
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
national editor

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:10,669
Forbes magazine Quentin hardy the

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,060
thank you very much as you know there
are two great teams at this concert

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,529
though

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,320
week on conference excuse me I see crowd
like this in

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,130
I expected a hold-up matches I as you
know they're two great teams were you

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,510
the one you saw coming in there is that
a stone which the skeleton key to

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,210
several great civilizations

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,629
clearly isolated and reflecting each
other it took a lot of brain work but

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,640
people could come at it the systemic way

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,180
and the other one that you're hearing up
on stage is like this in conference

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,580
rooms and among each other is

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,729
the growth for the cloud depending on
your religion the cloud is either

14
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,799
all of your data or a great deal of your
data

15
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,479
coming soon and its geographically

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,100
remote and ultimately not really
significant it's just sore about there

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,820
somewhere

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,890
your data is shared passed around

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,020
used in varieties a purposes I

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,220
the user might be the owner of the data
the time maybe the government it might

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,460
be a phone company it might be a bank
might be Facebook

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,409
could even be you who knows I'm and

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,579
this is a fascinating issue from a
security point of view cyber security

24
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:26,299
issues

25
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:30,020
around what identity means

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,820
what boundaries are anymore I spoke at
the resort a stone is having hard and

27
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,810
fast boundaries

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,450
we don't really have boundaries like
this in the world we're building

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,759
a great example for security is what
recently happened with Google in China

30
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,270
you know they announced this hack and
appears to come from the University well

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,490
was at university students universities
connerly to the chinese military with

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,460
the military

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,539
wasn't criminals was that hackers with
somebody else where who hijacked their

34
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,240
servers

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,929
was it the Chinese government and the
answer is a resounding

36
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,740
I don't know yet probably something like
that you look at what happens in

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,230
a Russia around Georgia there are
attacks inside the government

38
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,920
destabilizing it before the russian army
comes in

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,600
sup the boundaries of identity about

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,100
what a criminal attacker is what a
government attacker is what something

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,630
between is

42
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,620
we don't know arm and our own responses
in some ways is this responsibility of

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,370
our government

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,320
is the responsibility of the private
sector do you get ad hoc

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,160
fans have good guys coming together to
try to stop it and again the answer is

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,200
bit of everything at this point for
privacy point of view we have issues

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,020
around

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,390
well as this core how do we know what
score what is our Privacy what is are

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,830
appropriate role for this

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,890
and here to solve all these questions in
the next thirty seven minutes

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,760
mean 26 seconds I we have

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,520
3 experts in the field please welcome
Michael Church of

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Richard Clark and Marc Rotenberg

54
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,390
payoff so call

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,030
I'll start with you you recently carried
out an exercise

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,780
around this called cyber shockwave what
it should talk a little bit about that

57
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,750
and what the outcome in the exercise was

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,630
at this was a stage by the Bipartisan
Policy Center which is a bipartisan

59
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,520
group that

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,970
triste here we should I'm a factor and
complicated public issues

61
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,230
in this case it was a hypothetical
attack

62
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,980
on our communications networks using a
botnet and

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,020
a follow-on attack on the power grid and
reenacted a national

64
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,830
security council meeting the idea being
to lay on the table

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,870
some of the issues I that would emerge
in that kind of attack both the

66
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,580
dimensions of the consequences

67
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,880
but beyond that some the unsettled I'm
resolved questions

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,730
authority I strategy and implementation

69
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,290
that would come into play if we had to
respond to the attack was the stop on

70
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,990
the exercise

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,090
stop when the exercise was a general
consensus

72
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,520
among the group which were basically
former a senior public officials

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,810
that the president would have to take
vigorous action both in the world cyber

74
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,489
high in terms of shutting down parts of
the network Adam a.m.

75
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,300
requiring certain kinda response on the
network and also in the physical world

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,620
because they would be

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,320
consequences in terms of the ability to
you I secure

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,170
facilities in that kinda very have a
disordered environment that would

79
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,370
require literally

80
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,530
a federalizing the national guard had
really

81
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,240
imposing a serious have restrictions so
I think it was a

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,060
a core for dramatic and vigorous
response

83
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,060
but a recognition that a lot of the
controversial that have to be debated

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,170
in advance slows the time line and how
bad it have to get before the

85
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,430
president's the steps like

86
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,330
route you know we we operate over a
period of a about an hour and a half

87
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,880
a total I was that dimension in the
meeting during that hour and a half we

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,200
show our an exponential increase

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,479
in the degradation of the network and
then of course a

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,480
a blackout followers and that spread
rapidly over the eastern seaboard show

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,400
incentive a crisis at that unfolds over
days and weeks

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,680
this was a crisis that unfolded in
considerably less than 24 hours

93
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,610
keenan and ultimate you richard as you
hear about an exercise like that

94
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,360
is the structure appropriate and is that

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,440
a reasonable time one the the sunlight
that taking place in those

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,270
in that context well if there's a major
cyber war attack it is

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,610
but what's really happening in every day
is that

98
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,610
we are being attacked were being
attacked by

99
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,790
either the government or the criminal
gangs and there's very little difference

100
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,030
i think between the two

101
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,860
from China and Russia wouldn't every
major company

102
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,950
a in United States and in Europe

103
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,030
every major government institution has
been successfully penetrated

104
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,370
terabytes to petabytes of information
have been extracted

105
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,880
and our firewalls don't stop in our EB

106
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,130
was that industrial espionage hours at
work fare its industrial espionage

107
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,280
and it may never go to warfare

108
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,350
other lots of important issues if it
does

109
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,710
there are now twenty to thirty nations
would have warfare units

110
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,910
cyberspace warfare units including us
and we have no public strategy

111
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,900
for how the fight cyberwar fact I don't
think we have a private strategy

112
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,990
you truth be known but the day-to-day

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,800
espionage that's going on is eliminating
our economic

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,020
competitiveness do you feel like we're
in a low-level war at this point

115
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,610
something like the cold war was fought
by proxies are indications what could

116
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,270
get worse

117
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,970
I think what we have today is the
government of China and to some extent

118
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,270
the government to Russia

119
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,240
a and others but mainly them engaging in

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,320
daily activities successfully the United
States government is not stopping in

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,970
private industry is not stopping

122
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,880
and they're stealing anything that's
worth stealing terabytes in

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,450
love information and we can't even stop
them from actual trading it out of our

124
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:14,310
other corporations we're all here you
know talking about the cloud as though

125
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,940
that were the most important issue

126
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,270
when there has been a quantum change
over the last couple years in the nature

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,140
of what's going on in cyberspace

128
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,380
we're not even talking about will go
ahead

129
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,840
what is it so it it is this these to
fall

130
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,159
players nation-states have created cyber
warfare units

131
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,120
they are preparing the battlefield
that's the pentagon coz

132
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,580
praise for what they're doing the Wall
Street Journal reported

133
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,250
few months ago that somebody had laced
the US electric power grid

134
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,550
with logic bombs that's not espionage

135
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,969
thats preparation for worker yep and so

136
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,659
are we doing that too are we doing that
China is that why china did it to us

137
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,870
we'd be remiss not to announce well are
we creating a

138
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,340
a situation that the public doesn't know
about probably the congress doesn't know

139
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,200
about

140
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,729
where we are increasing tensions in
cyberspace

141
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,500
a in the way that is destabilized

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,909
in but that's going on that's relatively
new with the same time you have this

143
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,159
massive actual treasure enough
competitive data from corporations

144
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,940
throughout the country

145
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,409
going in large measure to China and
Russia and all the

146
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,599
little fiber devices with the company's
here sell

147
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,520
have been unable to stop in now mark as
a

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,650
privacy civil rights advocate

149
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,470
when you'd hear people talking about
federalizing the national guard after an

150
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,330
hour and a half activity

151
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,240
or the state a war we r at without
knowing it

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,650
how does that make you feel
uncomfortable but

153
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,700
yeah arm I don't think there's any real
dispute

154
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,970
about the need to improve network
security to recognize

155
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,180
that there are threats to US federal
agencies to US firms and I should say

156
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,050
US consumers those threats are real and
they need to be addressed

157
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,390
I think the big questions are what do we
do

158
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,550
do we give the government a lot more
authority do we start

159
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,430
authenticating all users do we start
tracking all communications this is

160
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,640
where the debate

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,850
really begins because I us to the goal

162
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,890
I think all three of us would agree I
mean we

163
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,380
we don't want a situation with the
network is vulnerable or services can be

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,460
shut down

165
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,440
where consumers are risk identity theft
we need to come up with

166
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,060
solutions that are smart and I think
we've had the experience with the

167
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,720
clipper chip for example were some
people said you know if we have

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,740
unbreakable encryption that could pose a
real

169
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,390
risk to national security we thought
about some more we realized

170
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,779
if we have escrow key encryption that's
going to pose a risk

171
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,140
national security to you so we need a

172
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,910
good solutions I think to some other
