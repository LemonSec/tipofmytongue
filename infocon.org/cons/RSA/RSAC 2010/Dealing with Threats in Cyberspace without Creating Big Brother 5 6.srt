1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,419
action this is the you know wait for the
cyber Pearl Harbor and then everything

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,390
will be good

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,450
because will always be up the next
morning and say we have to do something

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,530
argument and

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,889
in the problem with the wait for the
cyber Pearl Harbor argument is we're

6
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,740
having little pearl Harbor's every day

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,560
and the the amount to privacy
information that's being stolen

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,770
the successive cybercrime we're
prosecuting a very

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,980
Pelini weeny little percentage a
cybercrime

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,279
and where's the initiative to deal with
that

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,400
why do we always have to wait for
disasters

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,000
to solve problems that we all can
recognize in advance of the big disaster

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,340
if we do

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,540
we're going to lose out economically

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,070
because the drip drip drip every day up
industrial espionage by China and Russia

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,000
a is going to cause us to lose out to
tell your lawyer say in a sense is

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,020
treated and name it as important as if
it were

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,520
its physical corollary by no hi I think
we all agree with that

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,309
and act and I will tell you that people
have been preaching about this issue

20
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:08,130
four years in years take as I the people
have I've talked about it %um

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,740
Mike McConnell has and the reaction from
a lot of the public is either

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,820
indifference

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,240
or from some people which overblown it's
not a serious problem so we need to

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,890
understand why it is

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,740
that people don't take it seriously and
my belief is part of it is

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,869
that we its this solution seems so
complicated

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,939
the average person that they can't
really understand it a few

28
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,180
disempowered and therefore the your show

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,090
what I'm suggesting is to get ahead to
next Pearl Harbor is you've got to give

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,720
people

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,420
a solution that is accessible that they
are comfortable adopting

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,840
and then they will respond to it okay
arm

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,479
it's interesting area because I started
out talking about the ways in which

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,100
this infrastructure move breaks down
boundaries and you're saying in some

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,509
ways

36
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,790
it's the role government to name things
and set up distinctions

37
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,930
establish common standards maybe even
Q&A among saw

38
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,250
%um software companies so that we know
the reworking and

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,140
and start to establishing the working
down trees another role

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,560
is of course naming names when things
fall down

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,040
Richard in 2003 you said

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,370
let's take Microsoft at their word
they've made some problems they vowed to

43
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,940
do better

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,760
how have they done since 2003 really
haven't done worse

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,459
a.m. okay

46
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,930
but I i think Microsoft to be fair
Microsoft is

47
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,640
I will take up the iPhone Ross don't
worry they're not pride a little and

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,590
it's gotten a little better it's not
just my kids love the iPhone owners

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,110
you're a blackout last August

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,120
everybody was outdoing each other and a
new hack for that for the iPhone

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,170
a there's no government or private

52
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,560
a institution trusted institution that
his rating these things

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,660
there's no consumer protection agency

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,550
thats reading any of the cyber product
is nowhere that you can go and learn

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,390
that the iPhone is is practical by a
three year old for you so you think

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,530
there should be an agency where people
just go in

57
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,080
rated I don't think it should be the guy
to hack into rated I don't think anybody

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,450
here wanna work there

59
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,900
a know ep I don't think it should be the
government but I think there should be

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
some trusted

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,550
you know when when electric candle
lighter laboratory underwriters

62
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,340
laboratory started when when

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,739
Oilers began to blow up not sold on
drugs laboratory is but there's no

64
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,670
similar

65
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,260
trusted good housekeeping seal of
approval for these things

66
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,620
well you know we've spent some time over
the years

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,900
trying to educate the Federal Trade
Commission Washington about these issues

68
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,659
a.m. we do tanker consumer perspective
and I was actually I think back in 2002

69
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,590
that would raise concerns about passport
I think Microsoft at the time was

70
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,940
calling it hailstorm

71
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,939
are well chosen name but I was a single
sign-on

72
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,129
for the internet we went to the FTC and
said you know I could also be a real

73
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,260
vulnerability

74
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,299
may spend a lot of time and look dad
went back to microsoft:

75
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,280
so I may miss out the best way to go and
I think Microsoft actually eventually

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,330
came around and you see new system serve
a identity management that are much more

77
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,599
privacy protective and I think we're
pretty well on the security side

78
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,859
but it's still a real effort in
washington you know cloud computing for

79
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,859
example are going to talk a bit about
that

80
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,169
but we had gone to the FTC a year ago
and we said lesson for the end user

81
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,680
their real privacy and security issues
is going to be date out there they won't

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,710
know who's responsible they won't know
for some cryptid me

83
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,800
they won't know who has access to it can
we at least begin a process

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,509
developing some policy in this area and
some incentives for

85
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,139
for industry to recognize from those
issues and you know we keep hearing that

86
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,960
they're very interested in looking at it
but it's been a year

87
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,040
you now it workload is concerned you've
said

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,770
privacy in some ways has a lot to do
with

89
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,100
who's using at the time in what the
government does your data with the cell

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,960
phone company doesn't your data

91
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,430
with the bankers with your data you get
different access to different degrees

92
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,389
is the software behaving that way is
this something you see being stitched

93
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,850
into the process

94
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,210
well it's very hard for me to answer
that question because I don't

95
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,419
you know understand how this services
are operating I think obviously from the

96
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,520
user's perspective

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,100
you know there's tremendous benefit in a
lot of cloud-based

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,210
services and we're not against a
cloud-based services but we do think

99
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,030
that the privacy and security issues

100
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,419
don't get as much attention as they
should I mean even simple things for

101
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,530
example you know like encrypting gmail

102
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,220
right meaning that happened very quickly
after the

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,639
China episode a but there are a lot of
us is set for a long time

104
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,240
you know shin that should not be done
routinely and those kinds of issues

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,830
going to come up over and over again for
more these cloud-based application

106
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,750
and so there's a role for government
again with regulation that dirty our

107
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,580
word

108
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,840
maybe something should be encrypted
maybe they should be requirements that

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
sometimes things are encrypted

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,830
I don't know I don't have an objection
in principle to have the government

111
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,280
prayer roll but when I fear is knowing
how

112
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,340
the process works in administrative law
process hi

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,940
you know it's going to be years before
you get the kind you

114
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,669
a regulation you're talking about and
this move very quickly

115
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,910
sure you're talking about this for 10
years we've got the right we could have

116
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,669
it done by now

117
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,060
we could have but that's the nature of
government as a group that marketplace

118
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,150
your questions your act it really turns
out to be

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,100
a field in which you have to attack the
problem in multiple ways simultaneous

120
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,919
yes there's a role for government to set
standards particularly to prevent

121
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,370
people who freeloader of a good security
worker for other people

122
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,900
but there's also a role for the private
sector to make sure that you are looking

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,500
at both

124
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,490
access issues security issues encryption

125
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,729
hi making sure that just doesn't fail
because of some natural

126
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,080
up disaster that helmet and don't forget
again

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,410
this system is only as good as the
people who operated and you've got to

128
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,160
figure out how to work

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,340
out with the people who are using the
system so they don't undercut

130
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,419
I with protections you brought in
because

131
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,599
in the cloud if someone introduces a
vulnerability

132
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
into what you have until a series I have
a fire water air lock you could wind up

133
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,340
with a lot of collateral damage

134
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,449
show this is an area where but but again
it's only gonna happen if people

135
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,370
valium the privacy and security of the
data they put on the system

136
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,470
and here's my my belief again that and
maybe to start with a sophisticated

137
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,180
business huge

138
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,870
they will look at the choices at there
and they will begin to migrate to those

139
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,210
systems

140
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,729
that work for them a higher level
security for going to go on the quad

141
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,590
they haven't well I think that's gonna
start to happen and I think the

142
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,509
government here by the way can lead

143
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,770
not by regulating but by using its
market power there's huge market power

144
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,750
the government has won contracts

145
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,169
I Anders discussion now about having a
series of class

146
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,990
some much more art security oriented
perhaps more expensive

147
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,550
and others less expansion I think the
government could

148
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,400
as a consumer partial I Vista Del we
have just a couple minutes left them

149
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,940
I'm gonna ask a a final rundown markle
start with you but

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,990
same question all three what is

151
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,860
speaking from your passion your area
knowledge what is

152
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,949
in terms of what's going to happen next

153
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,910
the best possible outcome the worst
possible outcome

154
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,490
and the likely outcome you think will
happen a

155
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,699
well of course I tend to focus a lot on
washington

156
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,440
and what policymakers are doing and how
well they understand these issues

157
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,459
so in my ideal world

158
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:40,140
they have a good understanding of these
issues and they have a good

159
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,709
understanding of these issues and they
make some decisions

160
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,529
based on their understanding I'm not
someone who says government shouldn't be

161
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,290
involved

162
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,490
I think they're invariably involve and
when they are involved

163
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,200
you know I want them to know what the
issues are in particular to consider

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,260
privacy and civil liberties

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,790
worst outcome of course but people don't
know what they're doing

166
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,000
disregard arm these concerns

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,510
and the go ahead and act anyway a lot of
that happens

168
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,680
I am you know would be tempting to say
what the likely outcome is gonna be

169
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,760
somewhere in the middle

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,940
yeah and some places that's true a

171
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,110
but you know it's a fascinating area
because I think for the people in

172
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,980
washington really take the time to
understand it

173
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,830
they can come up with some innovative
stuff and if they can get people behind

174
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,769
them

175
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,380
who aren't afraid and have a bit of
political well you might actually see

176
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,000
some smart ideas a coming out on the
policy front so that's that's what I'll

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,330
yeah Richard I think the best possible
world would be one in which we stop

178
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,670
telling

179
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,790
every company that has two master
cyberspace and

180
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,870
and putting the onus on individuals and
putting the onus on every company

181
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,220
we do a little triage a problem seems to
me there are three

182
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,209
problems in government is well suited to
address those three problems

183
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,000
one is cyberwar where I think we need
