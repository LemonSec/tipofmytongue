1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,620
have it so you can't use that was it was
by that actually been tested in court

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,759
is whether that could be used as a lie
detector and

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,009
it it doesn't work because if we try to
show you something novel to you

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,469
we don't know whether maybe you have
seen it in your past that maybe you have

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,830
so sometimes that you can't you can't
know what's novel and what's not so you

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,320
don't know how to interpret the signal

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,980
so it's been actually thrown out of
court as a possible lie-detector

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,220
I C well as the is the problem in
identifying the

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,739
a individual characteristics that up the
brain on

10
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:35,980
a matter of the sensitivity of existing
equipment

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,700
or is it just that it's only

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,070
the major structures at the brain seen
in toto

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,670
that really distinguish one individual
from another well it could be

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,879
that its it is probably true that the
the overall electrical patterns

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,270
generated in each brain

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,530
is is somewhat unique I think we don't
have

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,609
accurate measurement techniques yet to
do that eyes as I said the noise

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,449
introduced by the measurement would
probably

19
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,700
masback but it wouldn't be surprising
each of us has a unique said that

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,110
neurons that are assembled in a unique
way based

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,500
in part on our experience so it could be
that we could have

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,930
direct neural signatures so someday you
might sit in front of your computer

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,979
but put your head in a little helmet in
there with their recognize you and

24
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,530
you could at least do certain modest
functions I think turning on turning it

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,100
off or

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,790
maybe directing it but again we have all
these great interfaces

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,180
already keyboards and fingers are not
bad so

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,509
victory we have we have these that to
have a that the one method that can do

29
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,200
this is something called
magnetoencephalography which has to have

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,860
SuperCon

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,439
cool magnets and I think they're
probably in the million dollar range so

32
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:42,780
we're

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,390
a long way just financially for having
any G's in front of everybody's computer

34
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,399
well let me ask a different

35
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,610
security-related question I'm one

36
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,780
a.m. development you for C in

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,680
in bring gate is the I'm fully
implantable version

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
which would require a wireless link
between the device implanted in

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,270
in the brain and the prosthetic limb or
whatever else is being controlled

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,430
so how do you protect the link between
the implant

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,530
and the prosthetic how do you prevent a
robotic arm from being maliciously

42
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,569
commandeered

43
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,590
already prevent jamming at the up a
signal on under

44
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,110
in include so when I'm ready to do that
I'll be back here

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,870
but actually get to you people have to
tell us how to do that I'm

46
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,290
I'm not an engineer I might know a
biologist by training so

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,510
we we do I mean there are you know
practical guide to simple things that we

48
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,790
would do like short-range

49
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,459
there are government bans that are
limited for medical devices

50
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,250
but really I think encryption would-be
important that we

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,260
chatted a little bit earlier about
controlling the wheelchair which is

52
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,629
actually quite simple to do

53
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:52,959
but in fact imagine the terror being in
a wheelchair

54
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,360
and trying to cross the street and to
bring control and have someone interfere

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,540
jam your signals

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,620
you would have to have a wheelchair that
had its own intelligence to know whether

57
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,310
to move or not move across the street
weather was dangerous to go backwards or

58
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,730
better to go forward so

59
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,459
these will be serious concerns that the
current system that we're using actually

60
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,890
uses an infrared signal

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,239
that only goes a few centimeters and
that you know course will

62
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,720
help a lot because it's like and its
very very short distance but

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,780
these devices you know that can

64
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,709
that are we were going to be you know
communicating short distances across the

65
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,209
body

66
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,659
and as this technology there may be you
know eisin years in

67
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,590
brain motor control devices people might
become my loaded with

68
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,269
radio devices and it would be a you know
something that has

69
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,560
conservative how do you protect all this
information coming through

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,780
okay so we have a homework assignment as
your at guys can do that

71
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,629
think about it over the next couple
years well we're out of time for the

72
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,269
session

73
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,470
but there will actually be an
opportunity for you to ask your own

74
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,280
questions

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,709
in the crypto Commons after that the
session has concluded

76
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,170
I'm thank you very much too all love you
her attending

77
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,310
last session today and please thank her
doctor Donna

78
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,909
well I'm and I hope to see in the pic
the comp are
