1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,030
the girl who got a gram and aunt when
Drew

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,250
have come up with a much better
algorithm amazing brings the time down

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,139
to the to the point three and roughly

4
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:12,570
space about the same so weird burners
and we were seeing the

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,080
so breakthroughs in somebody's
fundamental albums for problem

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,170
and keep cryptographic problems for a
long time um

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,269
the one project that involved was when
the pension

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,130
earlier david charmer led a team of
people for my was one on the skin

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,760
Tegrity

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,119
up voting system in to come apart are

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,739
that was really the story collection
really brings sophisticated

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,780
cryptographic techniques to bear on

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,480
on just regular election for city
council members and Mayor

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,379
are the voters into to like it or able
to take this technology

15
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,950
and make it usable as well as secure
which is that's the challenge with was

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,239
on the bodywork is the is to make it

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,690
be not only the security requirements
but the usability requirements that we

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,239
need to have kids

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,300
everybody needs to vote um

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,239
moving on another seed was planted 1991

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,390
when we publish the list the bars a
challenge numbers are so there was a

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,020
list of

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,409
numbers starting off with a hundred
digit number which was a broken

24
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,720
fairly quickly and that was the a
hundred and twenty nine digit number

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,830
that the was a pollution Scientific
American that was broken a few years

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,409
later

27
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,729
at this year's Azari said we've seen her
a breakthrough again with with the team

28
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:22,950
Afaria minstrel

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,950
your Montgomery in about a dozen other
folks breaking her say 768 768

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,470
it's not seventy six eight digits a and
its limits a major accomplishment

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,610
they started about five years ago
developing polynomials for the Civic

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,210
process

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,600
spent several years old computer time
doing so it's been broken

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
implications for our site went 1024 are
the cup 1024 Megan

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,130
broken in the next decade and people
since I think about moving to the ours

36
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,549
8048 or other schemes

37
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,850
over the next few years um and the final
01 that I i've been involved missus

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,860
have the seeds planted again in 1991
when md5 was published

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,060
I've been involved hash function so
since about the ninety-four as well

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,590
I forgot to get calls about people say I
would like to use md5 an application

41
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,420
and I think I think I sound a bit like
Monty Python and the parents get wanna

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,290
I talk to these people are saying my md5
that the dead hash function

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,660
hash function as extinct it is no longer
a hash function

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,660
a people see want to use in

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,530
up this has gone on too no taken

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,599
into account the the breakthroughs
showing in weighing and others have done

47
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,800
with hash functions in

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,480
and to have a competition think we need
to do to improve our technology base for

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,970
hash functions IMD 6 was submitted our
team at MIT submitted that

50
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,930
are the competition with was over the
world lot of good submissions

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,800
week one of the interesting events such
as we withdrew MB 6% from the

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,530
competition

53
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,709
for the next round we so that love the
albums were much faster than ours

54
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,230
and/or we felt it was very important to
have a proven security guards

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,680
differential cryptanalysis

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,360
are in order to reduced number rounds to
be competitive speed wise

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,920
are proof would work so we withdrew and
thus lot of good entries left I'm sure

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,140
we'll see a great result from

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,220
shot three competition little things
like in prepared remarks but i just

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,709
wanted to say also that I i

61
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,140
like up truck turns up

62
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,580
introduction to you prove technology
it's nice to see some sophisticated

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,730
cryptographic technology come into play
for identity management

64
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,840
and the ability to show arm credentials
without having to try your identity in

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,019
reform is very nice I hope that gets a
well-received

66
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,140
cinema remarks thank you I'm

67
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,709
dying to our night the my self-belief

68
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,629
of the most car no two of the get the
Olympics

69
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,680
and i must tell you that about this year

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,069
I was one of the best I've seen I'll
there were

71
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,220
lots and lots of our into the thing
development ranging

72
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,510
all the way from the most practical
ethics are two

73
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,080
medical ethical month so is an example
of major electrical it they

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,450
are a couple of months ago a group
headed by %ah

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,049
under oath on the UK I published an
amazingly simple it they

76
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,670
on the archie pimpin thief them which is
used to %uh politic

77
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,949
the credit card in the UK so it comes
out that you know that to make their

78
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,239
credit card is the most secure you put
our

79
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,900
achieve on the out the hand

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,940
then when you want to buy something in
this poll you are

81
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,590
himself to the cob into a small device
and you punch the possible

82
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,400
I into that thought the five and that
possible please check

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,169
are owned the are a cheap a

84
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,259
which is in your own car nothing there
back in 15

85
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,150
so this specification for obese him via
chip and pin

86
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,550
assist them is on for about 700 page if

87
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,660
it but the carville every possible
effective security

88
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,580
now with us on the phone and he speaks
caveat is their

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,169
their way the cheaper both big that the
possibles collect

90
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,539
is to send back the message 900

91
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,259
real always so it doesn't matter they
have wifi is not the amount they are

92
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,979
being paid that day

93
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,060
I any other details the cheap save

94
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,030
I am happy with the bus rolled I think
9000

95
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,180
so you have to do is throughout just
replaced the shipping been called by one

96
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,820
which will always love port 9000

97
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,039
and then you are done it's going to take
Shaw

98
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,100
moving to more to let the car the kind
of a pic

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,410
the fear was the really bountiful are

100
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,639
weekend I look for example it got this
state

101
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,699
about with as: security AAA should be in
the

102
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,870
look for many many years and Ethio

103
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,530
for the first time it Asia creeped up
2009

104
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,319
out there was the paper published by out
to russian-born could come early

105
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,180
are a.m. showing that it impossible to
break our

106
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,430
ATF with that one hundred six-b_ than
the other ninety

107
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,590
to be Keith faster than exhaustive
search

108
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,039
a major political heir important

109
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,069
and then it I you look great

110
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:17,639
2010 there's going to be a paper by
those are two guys and basically israeli

111
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,759
researchers

112
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,930
I'll who a where we are going to our

113
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,630
a.m. the Skype in a cake I which

114
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,110
ken Blake it 88th

115
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,039
I 128 with them down

116
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,530
if you try to make it more secure by
replacing the 128 be

117
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,979
by 256-bit key then we can

118
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,560
actually break the click to see if
they're in about 2 45 which is

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,669
completely break

120
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,750
so op a yes this kind of hybrid

121
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,250
which have 10 rounds as: 128

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,190
but will you try to make it key longer
up I can be broken

123
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,009
our respect the complexity and finally
I'll just mention they are

124
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,690
a.m. an attack which was published about
a month ago

125
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,900
a breaking the security 0 this soon to
be deployed

126
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,250
a 5-3 you all know this said story of
our a 5-1 in a 5-2

127
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,440
which where probably designed to be
Blake a boob a

128
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,660
from people and

129
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,930
then i win a 5-3 when

130
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,580
a 5-3 was designed to they decided to
take a great click the 50m

131
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,150
I'll I designed by up a

132
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,099
Doctor Who I am a fully formed a fun and
they try to improve re

133
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,220
they took me 50 and improve the into

134
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,479
Kusumi and it down thou that you can
break the full Kusumi click to see them

135
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,660
in the bow to the filter to tie

136
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,930
it

137
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,629
first required is claiming I speak today
as a private citizen

138
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,900
I love comments to make that they are
mine alone and cannot be attributed and

139
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
should not assume that the initially
endorses

140
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,539
them it's not that they are against them
they just haven't played in them so

141
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,979
they're mine alone

142
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,840
alright I found several interesting
things this year and the responses from

143
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
those as well

144
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,569
forgive the vision so this is detailed
I'd like to congratulate

145
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,539
the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology NT in you

146
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,180
they have a point in hacking group and
many you may know they broke a quantum

147
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,979
cryptographic

148
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,569
device by eavesdropping catching 100
percent at the bit

149
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,269
perfect and my other in point knew it
completely

150
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,789
total catastrophic demonstration and as
they say the proof is wrong

151
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,490
know the people for the security was in
physics the physics is fun

152
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,990
they went after the implementation it
was a brutal the compelling

153
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,310
demonstration at the need for quality

154
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,660
implementation please vendors in the
audience listened to that

155
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,300
there are three papers I read that I
thought were very interesting I do not

156
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,279
be broadly to the front the bastard

157
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,000
they just tweet me up but they were fun
Andrew let's go known to many as you

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,220
wrote a paper providing security within
secure systems

159
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,940
is no extended expect on his web page
he's getting it as a keynote speech at

160
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,320
the white thing conference coming up
this month

161
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,560
but is a good twist a short synopsis

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,550
a mix-up in perfect nickel security
measures and imperfect human processes

163
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,060
may synergistically provide good enough
security

164
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,279
and by the way publicly the Burton Group
things a summer song

165
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,320
but there are waves out of the mess we
find ourselves in today if not

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,160
having a math good security primitives
if you lashed together

167
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,950
things a innate appropriate way Justin
trout looked into the Raman

168
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,120
have a paper green cryptography cleaner
engineering through recycling

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,240
it was published in two parts by the
IEEE security and privacy

170
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,470
in September and August last year

171
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,149
they discuss how to package crypto
process has carefully for implementers

172
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,420
so they don't screw up when they've
install it into equipment

173
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,610
I'm going to keep beating on
implementation throughout the session

174
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,550
today

175
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,000
okay we know standardize cryptographic
primitives
