1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,149
cryptographic primitives like block
ciphers hash functions in math

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,180
they state we should also standardize as
well compositions have such primitive

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,800
if carefully crafted and that's the
really juicy praise

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,410
it should kill a lot of attacks now
managers can start treating infections

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,609
six to be and let a plane English very
good description of what he's getting at

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,930
the tough part

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,350
the techies can really get down to
section 6 Class to that as well

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,380
but the basic message is that you can do
Rackers around cryptography with

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,290
protocols control it offering a more
benign surface

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,210
to the using system and those are
specified in standards

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,989
emitted easier for the implemented just
a plug-and-play pick them up and put it

12
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:41,410
man

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,570
and not leave openings recite channel up
attacks and other sorts of things which

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,469
are embarrassing

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,640
or 900 effect or the other thing that
you mentioned

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,710
a forget the moment many these things
were flaws in implementation not

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,600
necessarily

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,910
with the underlying crypto by itself
alright

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,770
and finally at last paper by Neil called
with Mount Vernon invade

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,090
the brave new world up bodacious
assumptions and retire gritty

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,820
it's published in the notices in the AMS
the March 2010 issue

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,920
emerging so they mainly discuss and
their point is that proves up security

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,610
even if valid may deliver less than may
seem to

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,939
sometimes much less interpretation his
saddle

25
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,659
it's a cautionary tale and again
something that managers and implementers

26
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,500
need to re

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,090
I'm not trying to say proves are bad boy
we me bill

28
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,630
give you a basis to start if you don't
have one why even try to start

29
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,350
but they are not sufficient make sure
you understand the limiting

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,270
things they're offering my heaven on
earth and that it still matters

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,780
the implementation as the norwegians
demonstrated if you don't build it right

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,259
give up okay there were several other
topics that of other than just that I'd

33
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,090
like to hit on just

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,689
interesting news quips they came out
I'll you

35
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,850
are fully aware that but myths about
they're going after key scenes you

36
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,780
should not be aware 34 coming out also
going after

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,770
modems and routers so they can don't
have to call in the machine

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,459
all they can control who you see in what
on nameservers you go to

39
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,640
from the router that frightening and
it's very

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,739
compelling work a additional

41
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,730
areas like this what else can be falling
not yet but we're all beginning to use

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,870
iPhones and other mobile devices

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,980
for transactions the mobile devices
becoming much more powerful and complex

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,910
that makes it very juicy as a target
malware is already beginning to show up

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,030
for these instrument so whole new

46
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,790
pieces %uh the technology spectrum we
depend upon our are now subject to

47
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,470
malware

48
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,830
the situation is getting worse not
better and I'll

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,879
fame or in later sessions on how we can
try to get out of this mess

50
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,360
that is getting worse not better folks
and candidly

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,150
a I find it fascinating my last point
darpa

52
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,599
nice dodgy research process for the
Defense Department hired hacker

53
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,890
much and gave him a nice budget and
authority as a program manager to come

54
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,540
up with a new research agenda

55
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,330
I like that at show me that that culture
could go that far

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,980
ending that way I like much is very
aggression has nice but and has a

57
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,489
different

58
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,330
point a deal in getting there I have
high hopes

59
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,780
is also of course high-risk this could
be a collision made in hell no

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,250
fires and I don't know and I have great
hopes for and I think it was a good play

61
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,690
on the part of dark and

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,599
comments thank you very much crime I
thought it might be interesting for

63
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,290
audience this year to fill

64
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,489
here a little bit about your working
methods and you're all

65
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,620
of course rightly regarded as from the
most important features in our

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,480
community I'm back to a true story

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,890
a few years ago I was in the luv in that
part museum where they have the

68
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,080
bust serve into Greek philosophers Plato
Aristotle

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,060
Socrates and so forth and I'm looking at
these bearded sages

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,989
and suddenly one of them steps forward
and says hello to me shake my hand

71
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,220
and its run rhamat I

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,610
I don't know from was on display in the
museum in today or what was going on

73
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm but seriously you

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,950
all have important roles among the wise
women and wise man %uh var

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,190
community so let me ask you have you
ever done anything foolish

76
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,180
and has your doing something foolish in
the end actually turned out to be a wise

77
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,740
thing

78
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,870
would like to be bold enough to feel
that question for

79
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,610
have rarely done anything else some a

80
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,180
for for what I might under my favorite
talks is the wisdom of foolishness

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,520
and I i used I start off by saying
you've invited me here today because

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,870
by reputation in cryptography in the
irony is that while no one wants to

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,830
appear foolish

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,270
particularly in a place like Stanford I
got hearing you invited me because I did

85
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,949
something

86
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,210
literally all my colleagues told me was
foolish which was to work in Qatar for

87
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,990
free

88
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,570
back in the early seventies and until we
had good results

89
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,259
that was the uniform a with a

90
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,710
attitude and they had two very good
reasons NSA had a

91
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,300
humongous budget we didn't have big in
those days they've been working on it

92
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,820
for decades happen you hope to discover
anything they don't already know

93
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,979
and if you do anything good the
classifier

94
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,410
and both targeted came back to haunt us
later

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,860
the the first one more later with the
GCHQ

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,220
claims and and information and

97
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,990
them the one in to classify it that it
was a conference in October 77 at

98
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,009
cornell where

99
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,759
on the advice step its general counsel I
gave the papers instead have

100
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,410
to my students because we think there
are some concern we might be arrested

101
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:42,850
from

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,060
delivering the papers and yet in
hindsight you have to say was very wise

103
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,100
to be foolish and again like what I'd
say we're at hardly done anything else

104
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,199
if that's where you

105
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,569
really do good work is to do things that
are pollution most of the time they

106
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,169
don't work up occasionally have what I
call for a home run

107
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,479
I think in the sacred precision it ought
to be pointed out that the law will

108
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,340
being threatened with

109
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,229
I am at at at cornell incidentally I
went out of the way I hadn't have a

110
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,220
paper schedule

111
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,710
I went out on the way to give a a rum a
session talk

112
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,069
are with someone knows up because I was
younger and more foolish

113
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,360
but lonely threatened with was export
control I

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,650
classification except in the Atomic
Energy area

115
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,940
doesn't purport to brought everything
except contractual arrangements

116
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,680
there there's a a style foolishness what
goes on the theory committee which i

117
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,509
think is a son was two behind the two

118
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,410
we often assume that the what we know
now is this the best that

119
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,419
can be done p is snuggled in P

120
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:48,160
because we don't know either so many
prominent p are we think this problem

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,870
will take

122
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,690
forty quadrillion years because we don't
know any better in or things like this I

123
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,479
think I think it's helpful to

124
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,699
to to make foolish assumptions like that
explicitly

125
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,460
I to know when your basing a
cryptosystem on

126
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,349
some assumption that the weirdest you
know with we don't think we can do

127
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,919
better than this in the

128
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,729
crystallizes open problem for somebody
to Sol as a kind of foolishness which i

129
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,039
think has as mara

130
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,630
I thought often wrong we we often find
better algorithms which is so the

131
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,430
absecon remember the bet the factoring
overThumbs about that one has to be

132
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,190
fortune

133
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,889
sup other day while locals draw the line
here to rate this is the best we can do

134
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,319
and we can leverage it this way the you
cryptographic purposes

135
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,130
I did a quick mental calculation and I
have to admit that I'm about

136
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,169
ninety-nine percent for you because

137
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,979
every morning you know society if they
go to me of a different day

138
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:44,379
the five to walk on a hopeless problem
something to eat shop

139
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,449
people have look there for many many
years without success

140
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,349
something we she is a very very long
shot

141
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,389
and I'll about once every three months

142
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,599
and that they feel so I have a good API
but

143
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,629
I in the other 99 days they are coming
the morning it is like to welcome

144
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:03,599
something

145
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,620
they make no headway water bill and that
for just normal

146
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,069
and in our profession and up
surprisingly I'm sure that my employer

147
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,030
could have hired someone would be 100
percent clear why

148
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,449
every morning he was stepping fail fuck
Shea I

149
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,470
simple stuff that he will succeed at the
end of the day

150
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,060
in achieving whatever he affect the to
do and for fun with the pill me over the

151
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,030
other guy

152
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,260
good

153
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm going to cheat sheet I'll change the
question a little bit

154
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,560
rather than myself which is boring I'd
like to talk about the government

155
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,640
if not being foolish possibly taking a

156
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,779
unmerited risk RM on calibrated risk
something they weren't really aware

157
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,700
I'll come back and talk about the ATF
competition that selected ruled out as a

158
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,399
winner

159
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,490
I believe it's the right answer was a
good choice have no plans to the result

160
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,640
whatsoever but I think it has a strong
factor of luck in it as well as

161
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,700
being right and the basis for this is
reveal the process

162
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,880
how it happened a.m. started very

163
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,690
brief history here with the conference
were fifteen people stood up describing

164
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,860
their candidate and the audience got a
chance to take shots back it was a

165
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,290
social process

166
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,899
from coming to the only look good others
would be you're too fat

167
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,279
and other would-be you're too slow or I
have an attack

168
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,930
and these bullet to be spent and
typically it's a nice social process

169
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,649
among humans stopping the chest

170
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,089
that can it be dead on the floor that
yet

171
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,010
by stylist went beyond that point
Randolph was one up

172
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,190
in a short period of time about a year
after that it was me announced as the

173
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,660
winner

174
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,990
after further review and less than a
year after that something was mailed

175
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,500
call the Beas the big encryption
standard your system with a group hack

176
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,720
a right and the Cup the world became
very nervous for those who hear that

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,830
mike got do we have a dead standard on
their hands

178
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,680
do we really cook arrogance that's not
the fly want to talk about

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,519
because it wasn't
