1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,179
you in a coma are you alive those kinds
of things

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,310
but the other signal below is

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,860
are the spiking that's the spy cam one
nor on their their impulses

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,000
and that is this the code that computers
that

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,300
sorry the composed that neurons use to
communicate to each other that is the

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,490
language of the brain

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,090
and it's our job to crack that code
understand what is that syriza

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,010
pollsters mean in terms it's a 12 so

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,119
you're listening this is what North
physiologist do all day long they listen

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,390
to those crackles and try to figure out
what they mean

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,390
I so you actually listening into the
brain I

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,750
and the problem with the signals which
are the information-rich signals on the

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,070
on the brain if you want to get access
to them the only way to get to them

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,129
is to put a microelectrode in the brain
microelectrode is basically a very

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,579
the in needle I you can see one next to
a hair here

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,840
and it's a it's introduced into the
brain and basically the tip of the

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,190
electrode is a sensor

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,140
and it has to be noted that very close
to the cell the sellers like a broadcast

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,739
power and

20
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,940
for short-distance it generates these
impulses and the problem we have is not

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,380
only do we have to put electrodes in the
brain but we have to have a lot of them

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,470
because we don't want to listen to sort
one conversation we have to listen to as

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,590
many as we can get

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,119
and the way we do that now is we

25
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,400
we basically invented this 100
microelectrode array

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,909
as they said it's about the size of a
baby aspirin and it is implanted just

27
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,200
into the surface and the cortex that
peel on the outside

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,850
and as a as you can see there the little
plug on the surface that goes through

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,079
the skin and brings that signal to the
outside

30
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,150
and this is the device that we developed
in my laboratory

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,210
I just to give you a sense have the the
scale it's actually quite tiny that's a

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,409
penny so barely covers Lincoln on the
any

33
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,439
now the other big problem is knowing

34
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,229
a how to make sense and the signals you
heard that was actually a movement

35
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,920
related signal you would never guess it
just sounds like a crackle

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,100
basically what happens is you can see
here

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,630
I trade have many neurons spikes coming
out to those little tick marks or spikes

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,110
and basically at its maximum flow rate I

39
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,229
if you're listening to a hundred neurons
are recording a hundred neurons it's

40
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,280
like getting a hundred

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,789
bit I information stream at one killer
hurts

42
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,500
that's about as fast as it goes it's not
real fast but there's a lot of

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,390
information there

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,420
in our job in decoding is trying to
relate

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,890
something like a kinematic Vale variable
like the velocity

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,569
to a the spiking and we use techniques
like linear regression or other more

47
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,319
complex techniques to map

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,050
what is the relationship between the
spiking we see and something going on in

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,090
the outside world

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,420
the rather than spend half an hour
explaining the math I thought I would

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,940
try to give you just some intuition at
the approach we take

52
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,519
so you can imagine you had one of these
microelectrodes in my brain in my

53
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,060
arm area motor cortex and we're
recording while I made

54
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,129
small movement say to the left or to the
right my arm

55
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,090
and every time I moved to the left that
nor on May 7 at the spikes

56
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,590
every time I move to the right it made
to the naked have a decoding scheme 7

57
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,970
means left to means right

58
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,769
I went behind stage and all you heard
with the pulses if you heard seven you

59
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,590
would guess I had just moved to the left

60
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,489
so that's fundamentally the way we we
look at this code we count the number

61
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:08,390
spikes in a small time interval

62
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,560
usually about 50 milliseconds the
problem is is that the code is not that

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,200
reliable

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,230
the number of spikes every time I move
say a little bit to the left

65
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,300
is not the same sometimes it's fewer
sometimes it's more

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,300
so what we have to do is average across
many neurons and by averaging that count

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,190
over many neurons in these behind in we
actually do get a very good

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,959
estimate where you're moving your hand
in space so

69
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,709
with all that background knowledge some
some knowing where to go to get

70
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,140
arm signals knowing what that signals
look like and

71
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,379
what kind of information they had all
done from basic science

72
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,080
we we then I applied to the FDA and got
permission to test

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,920
in a a small group of people the
feasibility of

74
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,239
then using the signals to actually
produce movement in

75
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,010
so there have been five people implanted
the two you see they're called s1 and s3

76
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,400
actually Matt Nagel and Cathy Hutchinson
Kathy and Matt I'll call them

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,480
and if I want talk II won't show

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,489
as many videos as I'd like to show but
if you wanna see more Kathy she was on

79
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:12,549
sixty minutes

80
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,079
I where they told her whole story and
and are you so they bring a technology

81
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,239
all other people with implanted are all
paralyze the cat with their arms and

82
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:20,970
legs

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,380
it's a seriously debilitating condition
where you rely on

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,030
others completely for anything you do

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,270
so what are the big issues for us was
you know

86
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,840
could what's going on in the brain after
its been disconnected from the world for

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,759
years in every case our patients were to
an in cathy's case

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,479
nine years since they had actually moved
a limb we were concerned that the brain

89
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,750
would be shut down

90
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,070
or even if they thought about moving
nothing would really happen

91
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,449
so what I'm going to do is let you
listen in on Kathy's brain

92
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,540
and you going is that the pink thing you
see there is one of those spikes spread

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,419
out in time so this is what it looks
like but it's only 1.6 mil a second in

94
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,040
time

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,990
or if you look slightly to the left to
be to see a lot of these pink spikes

96
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,210
going by

97
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,610
I'm and those are the that once cells

98
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,340
I signal going out basically just listen
to it you can hear

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,940
the activity and what you'll hear
technician do is ask her to imagine that

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,300
she's

101
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,690
opening your hand closing your hand or
relaxing

102
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,979
and what you can hear is you'll hear her
thinking about moving and those

103
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,539
clicking the spiking noise you hear is
listening to human thought about

104
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,410
movement

105
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,380
and you'll hear that when he says open
your hand it'll be very active in which

106
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,370
he closer and it'll be almost silent

107
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,910
act

108
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:41,910
talking in your hand cadillacs

109
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,540
closer and relax

110
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,180
open hand kill you you're listening

111
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,750
21 brain cell and its signal about
movement and I think actually it just by

112
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,390
listening to the sound you can tell
there's information there

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,460
this is what we capitalized on and we
were very excited because we knew the

114
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,050
brain remained active even though it was
disconnected and

115
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,670
and cut off from the outside world so
week we could build

116
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,850
are using all the neurons in all the
information from different neurons we

117
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,270
could

118
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,650
up build a decoder and here you go to
see Matthew nari

119
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,150
his own early use up the system so here
you can see him with the technician

120
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm he's got the connector on his head
is sitting in his wheelchair

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,500
and he's going to do two things that
he's going to narrate himself the first

122
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,760
thing is going to do is open and email
program by

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,600
just drag your cursor over an envelope
it's a real email program is one we made

124
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:38,870
up

125
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,810
and he's gonna try to draw the world's
first neural 0 is gonna draw circle

126
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,020
with this just using his mind so you get
to see him do that

127
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,580
you can see him there there's a
ventilator to

128
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,870
is a little bit quiet because the
ventilator is he has them support to

129
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,310
brief

130
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,380
okay without panic that up way like

131
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,220
depressed all

132
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,850
my email okay p

133
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:11,850
first-line you know the first class its

134
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,290
graduation June 21

135
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,640
I get sec

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,310
email okay says hi

137
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,350
toss

138
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,350
great half-naked back to the by Haaretz

139
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,510
I the one that

140
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,450
excellent a trials in a draw circle

141
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,210
of for this is just a little inkwell and
he tries

142
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,210
three times and you can see him get
better as he practices for yeah

143
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,050
right player

144
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,000
up

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,330
here high in the air is at hand sir

146
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:12,330
like to avoid okay the dow we try to get
a few minutes later

147
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,230
extra now just try I we just witnessed
the world's first

148
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,270
up drawing a minnow using only your
brain

149
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,180
so we were interested you know given
these that then that was an early side

150
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,590
a being able to control a cursor but
with that some improvements we were

151
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,300
asking

152
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,960
well what can we demonstrate that you
can actually do that would be a use for

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,860
these individuals

154
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,570
so so here you see Kathy doing two
things with the computer interface

155
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,980
on the left she's using a kind of
smartphone by typing

156
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,310
where she's pointing and clicking at
letters and I asked her what she thought

157
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,660
in the technology and she's typing out I
love it

158
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,520
I and secondly on the on the right you
can see her using just basically what is

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,900
a

160
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,319
TV remote control but she's now using
just thoughts to guide the cursor to the

161
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,820
TV channel or the volume and and be able
to select what she wants to do with the

162
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,350
TV

163
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,880
in addition we wanted to know

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,540
is it feasible for people to control
real-world objects these people really

165
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,530
want to be able to interact with the
world

166
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,350
so we asked met with that Matthew up
with this prosthetic hand

167
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,540
it's a motorized and it opens and closes
usually driven by some switcher some

168
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,110
muscle

169
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,510
here he is fucked up to to from his
brain directly to the handle is the

170
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,330
first thing that he controlled in years

171
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,520
directly with his with any output and
here's that you can see his reaction

172
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,290
know you can listen to it

173
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,870
once we start this video 0 hold

174
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,630
should all and let's set will run it
again because it usually get

175
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,740
but I think it shows the impact so can
you back up in

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,440
and do it again there 0

177
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,670
school share 0

178
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,980
so though obviously it important
