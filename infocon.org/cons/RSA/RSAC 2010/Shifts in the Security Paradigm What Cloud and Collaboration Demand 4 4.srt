1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,199
the prion or miss topic to try to figure
out

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,960
you know what are some other security
issues are the impediments to getting to

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,710
a success and I think that if we
basically take this issue and we start

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,260
looking at it from a couple different
perspectives

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,460
for example we think about the
perspective the

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,730
end-user we look at the the IT expert
really

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,909
the the community of IT practitioners in
an organization

8
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:27,079
we also look at the provider community
as well I think that's going to be very

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,919
important

10
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:31,409
because he's maybe a lil bit high for a
lot of hype right now in the market

11
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:35,610
space and so we need to learn from
providers as well as end-users terms of

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,230
what's really happening out there and

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,040
is in fact security a major driver
inhibitor

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,920
is it exacerbate the kinds of problems
that you see an on-premise technologies

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,950
either to some other things and I heard
today hey

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,329
on now you'll notice there's a beautiful
picture the cloud

17
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,170
thank you for that are working you'll
also notice at WWW

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,250
that pondimin Dow toward slash our essay
we r

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,190
looking for the best people in the world
we want you

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,369
to go to our website and register for
this

21
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,090
absolutely terrific survey so if you do
it here's what I promise you

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,479
I promise that we will see provide a
summary I

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,950
we will not violate your privacy and we
will

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,990
share that information with you and

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,289
and I think it's really important that
we learn from you have

26
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,810
being a talking head here we need to
spend time understanding what's in your

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,600
head in that

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,939
the survey will be very helpful to I
sell hopefully everyone will participate

29
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,509
I really appreciate that you know to
celebrate email address or anything

30
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,999
we get that second there that now dole
you don't get good I was checkin

31
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:45,109
yeah I thanks larry in it thanks

32

a it's a great thing it's it's larry is

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,880
working I legacies a world renown in a
stable work in research in anything will

available the early in May

35
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:00,060
it will publish it back out so I really
encourage you to do that

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,789
so it's a wrap up I think that I started
talking about his security inhibitor to

37
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,200
cloud adoption and

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,160
and I i really don't think it is i think
the based on their knowledge and

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,140
intellect to the people in this room in
in the in the security organizations in

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,090
our company's

41
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,530
but I really think that we can stop
being looked at as an inhibitor

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,290
but I really truly believe that we all
can be enable others to help

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,860
organizations take advantage of this new
technology as it continues to evolve so

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,140
I like to thank you very much

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,530
