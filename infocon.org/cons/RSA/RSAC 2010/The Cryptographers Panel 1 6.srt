ladies and gentleman please welcome
chief scientist and director

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:11,120
RCA Laboratories re: jewels

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,730
time

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,320
thank you ladies and gentlemen it's a
pleasure and a great honour

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,740
host this year's cryptographer span of
as in past years were privileged to have

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,400
with us

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,100
four legendary founders at the field
this year we also have a very

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,810
interesting special guest

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,030
so please join with me in welcoming with
defeat

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,370
Martin Helmand rendre best

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,370
I think shamir and Brian snow way

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
well this year has

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
certainly been chock-full love
interesting event a

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,460
landmark arce factorization

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,230
major espionage attacks against US
corporations

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,850
I'm a very interesting new cryptosystem
invented

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,040
so many possibilities to discuss today
out perhaps it if you can

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,390
take a few minutes though and tell our
audience what

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,170
boxer for most in your minds these days
were you thinking about what he would

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,110
you working on

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,700
with would you like to be in well I
think for anybody who

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,200
doesn't now the most important security
development have the past year

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,240
is that I have left Sun Microsystems I

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,710
for for for and I'm now available to do
more interesting work

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,280
I don't think I'll actually say very
much more I think I'm

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,430
looking forward to some other questions
that have been cooked up in the

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,440
the discussion that's going to follow
I'll give you this is my custom

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,170
a couple bobbitt's wanna home is will be
known to the mathematicians in the

29
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,810
audience

30
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,680
man and Sean Wiley died John Wiley

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,250
was is best-known some people for

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,120
indiscreet memos saying that he couldn't
find any fault with James Ellis argument

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,290
in favor a public key cryptography but
he wished he could

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,550
on he was chief mathematician he worked
in

35
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,269
GCHQ at at Bletchley Park it was off
back to Cambridge for a while

36
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,820
he's now direct apologist he is the
author though one in the office at

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,970
Hilton Wiley

38
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,310
an algebraic topology major feature in
up

39
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,600
Cambridge mathematics plan century
returned in the fifties

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,510
as HR I the head mathematician

41
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,590
the other one will be known to almost
nobody

42
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,850
I his name is net newburgh is a man a
very good taste

43
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,230
I first met him at the second Europe
crept

44
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,170
including a in the day Italy in 1983

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,070
I is known as a man and he tried to
recruit me

46
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,620
and the other thing he did at that
meeting I wouldn't you

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,579
small wiry incredibly energetic guy when
the chinese guy got up to speak he was

48
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,489
just all over it taking notes running
around the corner from

49
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,590
get a better look at the blackboard I
last saw him a couple years ago and his

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,500
death took me completely by surprise

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,459
I'm last thing how this comment on as I
had the privilege

52
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,519
about two weeks ago a book three weeks
whatever it is

53
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,549
going to the information assurance
exposition

54
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,630
at the open land hotel in nashville

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,160
up this is that this was three days
before Sarah Palin

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,980
held forth from the same venue and

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,829
and it was described to me when I was
told I should try to get an invitation

58
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,510
as the crypto custodians con conference
this is where you go to find out you

59
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:50,840
know

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,919
what new kinds of equipment coming out
%uh Venice say what you wanna be

61
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,130
having to account for in this that and
the other and I'd say two things

62
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,260
later then to leave you think this
conference is bad try going to that one

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,209
it has FourTrax I all running
simultaneously with no space left

64
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:07,959
anywhere

65
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,000
except I never got beyond the first
track because it has six tracks within

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,250
on but one thing or two things I want to
comment I i there was

67
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,280
they seem to be taking sweet be very
seriously

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,419
I said when a cop to bed now appeared in
2005

69
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,900
that I be a was very much very much a
matter of principle

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,040
issue a regulation says this is going to
be authorized to this that and the other

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,850
in approved implementations and so

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,160
I now see a good deal more evidence that

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,389
the are approved implementations being
developed

74
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,139
and that the this may in fact give us

75
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,940
eighty a new era of interoperability and
at some level

76
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,090
upgrade a harmony between the government
organizations

77
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,230
and the private sector the other thing
um

78
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,260
say they're their revising the key
management system

79
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,280
and the stamped everything they said for
official use only but I hope they won't

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,610
be offended if I say this

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,360
they've model the you to review the talk
about modeling the user interface on

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,319
Amazon

83
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,470
on you get a web page you need key you
any web page in your turkey

84
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,240
or you know that affect like getting a a
textarea Kendall

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,139
on the other hand maybe you need a hard
copy if you need a piece a crypto

86
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:25,919
Quitman

87
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,699
you go on the same webpage and you order
it give the defense Korea service

88
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,310
address

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,710
and the ship it somewhere so I E A

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,310
I'm noting in two respects a convergence
between the

91
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,419
the public world and the slightly less
secret world

92
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,639
well with focused on people who died I'm
gonna focus on people who led

93
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,050
and and thinking about that some have
been born event

94
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,539
and the last year I think you've it was
february 7

95
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,550
have this year David conjured eighty

96
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,580
and thinking back twenty years ago I

97
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,310
people here a building on the work that
was done 2030

98
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,620
years ago by some of us in some cases
but in

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,620
certainly which in my case I think yours
ron and I just found out Brian's case

100
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,430
also

101
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,449
the code breakers which is David Kahn's
bestselling book

102
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,220
from the late sixties played a key role
in are getting edged in cryptography and

103
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,500
also in providing

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,150
background beyond that when Whitten I'm

105
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,449
first join forces and the literature was

106
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,300
very minimal and very hard to get a hold
of David had amassed an amazing library

107
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,729
on at in Great Neck New York which he
made available to us

108
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,259
copying things for us letting us take
things out to copy which showed great

109
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:39,930
trust

110
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,639
so I'd like to wish David Kahn a happier
eighty birthday on all or parts for his

111
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,629
part in

112
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:49,139
leading to Inc arce 2010

113
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,000
yeah

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,699
the the other person I'd like to mention
briefly is Ralph Merkle

115
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,189
this is connected with the AA in a word
that wit

116
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,479
ralph and I will be receiving in June
it's been announced already

117
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,479
it's a major IEEE award the heading
battle and

118
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,240
Whitney I have many awards Ralph has a
few

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,669
and deserves much more credit than then
he gets

120
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:19,960
so just to wait out here a ralph was a
master student working at berkeley

121
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,469
and he came up with the idea of secure
communication over in secure channels

122
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,080
with no prior arrangement

123
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,840
and then he wrote on his project
description which the professors that

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,169
didn't make much sense

125
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm not kidding

126
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,719
and had a second project that the
professor preferred but he

127
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,930
he went with the first anyway he dropped
the course I recently found out because

128
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,830
to that

129
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,330
and his paper which appeared the CAPM a
year roughly a year after which than

130
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,870
mine

131
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,120
new directions in cryptography has a
submission date which is prior to ours

132
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,969
but he had a reviewer who said you can't
do that

133
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,530
whereas we had an editor who got our
paper in from the final submission in

134
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,060
July 76 to November 76 on her to

135
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,580
a repeatedly just a bit the issue didn't
actually come out till February

136
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,370
it up it and I'm sure routes issue
didn't come out to four months after two

137
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:11,990
so

138
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,240
a I was very pleased to see that a
Merkel

139
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,650
was getting some the credit that that he
deserves a long way with myself

140
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,650
for inventing public key cryptography

141
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,889
like to respond to the question with the

142
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,379
some things I've been involved whether
the company I over the last year

143
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,210
and what do these things have seeds the
go quite a ways back and would like to

144
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,289
sort of a summer the seeds to

145
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,590
up for prime logic order with the seeds
in 1978

146
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,659
Mike 22 is also a little bit and I wrote
a paper on

147
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,900
I'm keeping databases private by having
all the data

148
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,680
be a cryptid working on the safer text
without having to be cryptic

149
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,540
it seems that a fanciful the time and we
weren't able to to do it and it's been

150
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,970
an open problem since that %uh this past
year

151
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,100
it's been amazing to see the problem
solved Craig Gentry has come up with the

152
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,600
actually more than one now proposal for
achieving homomorphic encryption

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,490
a way to encrypt data so that a server
cloud computer say

154
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,580
good the work on on this data

155
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,730
without having to be cryptic do
arbitrary computations

156
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,680
so amazing stuff its runs in polynomial
time

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,160
and the security primitives its a like

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,130
security primer to the 10th power which
is a polynomial only a theoretician

159
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,460
could love

160
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,670
but it is so it's not practical yet but
it was just amazing a

161
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,130
breakthrough I'll we're continuing to
see

162
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,280
TC breakthroughs even on things that
have been done a long time ago won the

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,630
cup my either I was involved with the
reduced

164
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,130
are a seed was was the paper that I the
road with rich repel back in 1981

165
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,330
a breaking the knapsack ask even Rd and
Richard A

166
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,920
wonderful scheme which had time to the
end over to for an element knapsack

167
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,910
and space to the in over four and that
means an open problem now for thirty

168
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,620
years

169
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,730
as to whether that could be improved on
finally
