1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,009
good afternoon and thank you for that
warm welcome and thank you for joining

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,150
me here

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,179
this afternoon you know IBM

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:12,519
we have an outstanding team focused on
delivering IT security

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,850
capabilities to our clients all over the
world fact it was just two days ago two

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,750
nights ago

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,410
were recognized by SC magazine who on
earth

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,630
with an award naming IBM as the top IT
security company

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,090
well I'm planes to represent that team

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,050
especially here at the 2010 ours a
conference

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,760
which appropriately proclaims itself to
be the place

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,100
where the world talk security now

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,940
the same spending as I'm here today to
speak with to you today

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,100
about this ever-changing world that we
find ourselves in

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,320
the future business security and how
would really impact the company's

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,149
we work for as well as you and I in
every aspect

17
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,579
a are lives you know it's really
impossible to open a newspaper turn on

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,539
the TV listen to the radio

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,619
even go on a business trip without
reading saying or

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,049
been personally impacted well with the
issue of security in our lives

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,700
and it could lead to some interesting
interactions a

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,299
is I checked in at the airport on the
way this conference

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,540
the ticket agent ass me some standard
security questions

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,720
has anyone given you any packages that
you didn't actor sup

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,560
well I told him that my mother-in-law
he'd give me a parcel that

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,100
she wanted me to deliver to my wife was
gonna meet me in San Francisco

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,549
he looked at me very carefully and asked
does your mother-in-law like you

28
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,450
well

29
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,220
again it's everywhere as I prepared for
the keynote here today

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,220
award learn more about the present a
stone which

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,969
of course is the that they move this and
that and as you know

32
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,159
but now I the Rosetta Stone was created
by the ancient Egyptian council approves

33
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,719
in either a buddy to hello me the Fed

34
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,489
and in reading the translation of this
ancient

35
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,870
text I was intrigued to see that
security was a topic of concern

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,230
and focus even back then at the good

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,430
King has praised or his focus on the
safety and security of those people

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,489
and though we might call this today
strategic risk management

39
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,170
but according to the text at the King

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,849
belgrade armies and maybe to protect the
land from invasion

41
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,660
build fortifications incredible
fortifications to protect cities

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,379
in people from harm in built dams to

43
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,959
protect the flooding up the plane's he
spent great sums of money

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,220
and again this was all to subdue

45
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,200
things that could do harm bring harm to
the people other priests praised the

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,300
King because

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,390
they saw that over time with strong
security

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,659
had come strong prosperity no topic that
really i think is timely for us

49
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:13,360
here today now obviously a lot has
changed in the past that two thousand

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,370
years since

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,010
the carping at the stone yet much as the
same we still praise or

52
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,090
condemn our leaders and we worry about
the prosperity and well-being

53
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,720
a people but fortunately we no longer
pink a while sir

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,920
have to carve text in the stone the
communications about thoughts and ideas

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,230
Rep revolutionized by the printing press

56
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,980
transmitted in minutes now but telegraph
and telephone in a course then carried

57
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,549
into

58
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,780
other homes and the masses for mass
media radio and television

59
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,970
these things are all now completely
ingrained

60
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,000
in that the fiber a very day everyday
lives

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,049
up in again technologies that we
considered science fiction here fifty

62
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,060
years ago

63
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,340
our everyday things that we use mobile
applications

64
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,909
tweeting as possibly summer you're doing
right now

65
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,870
Facebook and blog again but the simple
fact remains

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,169
with strong security calms strong
prosperity

67
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,729
now I'm sure that here on day three at
this conference

68
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,759
I don't have to explain to you how our
lives are getting more complex

69
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,270
the pace of change in business politics
technology

70
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,470
it's all accelerating exponentially

71
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,919
and we're not talking about mile
episodic change

72
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,330
we're talking about indeed turbulent
change

73
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,560
economic disruptions cyberattacks

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,240
political upheaval technology lead
products

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,800
and even naturally that disasters that
occur

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,400
up without warning even when we
anticipate change

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,199
may be driven by new partnerships
mergers acquisitions are

78
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,650
other strategic management initiatives
up

79
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,800
in requires our leaders to really deal
with making decisions

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,930
in the face of uncertainty a in order to
continue

81
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,220
economic growth and expanding
stakeholder value

82
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,740
well in the face while this uncertainty
are we anticipate

83
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,699
how we prepare for all the bad things
that can happen

84
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,370
organizations at the end of the day have
to learn to not only

85
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,880
embrace change but to thrive on it in
these times

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,020
now I believe every person in this room
knows all too well

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,360
the complexities and the challenges with
the technology that is creating a world

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,190
that's becoming evermore wherever more
real-time

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,190
more interconnected and indeed smarter

90
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,710
everyday I'm sure that that by this
point the conference

91
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,800
you gone over every fear every bowler
ability

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,319
and all these things that create stress
in your workday Mb on

93
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,949
I in the bin thoroughly expanded on in
with good intent because

94
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,590
awareness is one of the things that
getting these inspire action

95
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,699
so this afternoon I've come to talk
instead about a vision of the future by

96
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,259
T security

97
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,919
because vision can also inspire action

98
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,430
now over the last two years I'm sure
you've heard IBM's

99
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,000
speak a lot about the concept we call
smarter planet

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,210
know some people call this the
intelligent world others have written

101
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,060
about it

102
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,410
as the Internet of Things the concepts
are all

103
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,360
quite similar our plan to grow smarter

104
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,270
because the sheer magnitude the data
that we can collect

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,490
about events and activities in our
everyday lives

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,500
the ability to share that data I where
billions of devices have built-in

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,849
intelligence

108
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,020
a is really what gives us the
opportunity to use this data

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,440
to understand the control what happening
in changing in the

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,520
environment around us now this year 2010

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,660
marks the beginning of a new air I
welcome you to the decade of smart

112
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,870
in these next 10 years more than ever
before

113
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,030
you will find ways to make the
collection

114
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,270
and analysis of the data we collect
actionable

115
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,509
so that we can change the way the world
works or the bat

116
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,870
now these changes will be delivered that
will happen because

117
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,710
up the development %uh leading-edge
capabilities leading-edge software

118
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,199
capability

119
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,120
because are smarter planet its release
software that is the power

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,789
up the innovation that's changing the
way that we live

121
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,590
just think about the impact of software
in our lives

122
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,569
you know were able to transform
utilities industry so the people

123
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,669
only consume what they need when they
need it

124
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,669
for example leading utility provider in
Spain is launching

125
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,879
an automated energy management system
that enables more than 300 industrial

126
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,889
customers

127
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,470
900 service providers and 11,000
households

128
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,669
to better control their energy usage
users will be able to

129
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,240
establish consumption protocols but to
minimize our electricity usage

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,009
in peak periods and take full advantage
of renewable energy resources

131
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,979
when they're available this is a example

132
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,399
a house of horrors helping utilities add
a layer of digital intelligence

133
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,740
to the grids that they operate today the
smart grids use sensors

134
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,169
meters digital controls in analytic
tools have all types to

135
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,890
automate monitor and control the two-way
flow of information

136
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,649
up around energy across their operations
literally from

137
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,790
the power plant to the plot

138
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,990
now the smart grids a again a lower
power company to optimize performance

139
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,670
prevent outages

140
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,500
restore outages and allow consumers more
control

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,860
over their energy usage right down to

142
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,970
network appliances

143
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,690
now of course solutions like this
naturally raise

144
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,260
concerns concerns around privacy and
safety

145
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,029
greater efficiency relies on data better
data but thats of

146
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,580
then the most sensitive data that we
have available

147
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,779
greater control relies on better access
to these meters for example one

148
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,050
all the devices installed on the power
consumers premises

149
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,709
but it also opens up new avenues for
criminals a whole new wave

150
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,440
up denial of service attacked

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,399
up the smarter planet also means that we
have to be smarter about these issues

152
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
it means that we've got to build
security and privacy controls

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,980
into the system's not as an afterthought
but right from the beginning

154
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll come back to this thought assumedly
mayor
