1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,060
the war them as opposed to the cyber
espionage

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,150
goes on everyday you worry about cyber
war

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,179
the first thing that happens all the
scenarios what happened in your game the

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,820
other day

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,450
electric-powered goes down so

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,070
why is the electric power grid connected
to the Internet right

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,460
and is it really beyond the technical
capability %uh all

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,699
these people here I in this room to
design electric power grid

9
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,830
that can't be attacked from the internet

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,219
or when one part goes down the rest just
go into lockdown immediately

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,350
so in what you know why are we doing
because

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,360
would require the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,620
get serious about regulation and they
haven't been

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,420
know they say they're going to regulate
this year they say they're gonna find

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,620
people this year

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,379
who are don't have that cybersecurity I
don't know how they're gonna find

17
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,190
anybody because they have no staff

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,780
that would be able to do an audit have
any Electric Power Company for

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,680
cybersecurity

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,930
mark these guys are talking and I'm
talking about doing these incredibly

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,840
sweeping

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,549
global pervasive tax are there

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,850
things that are true Inc or about
privacy that you need to think about

24
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,939
when you're making policy like lol I
mean privacy ends up being the

25
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,330
collateral damage

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,750
yeah you know in a cyberwar battles
because people play out the scenarios

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,890
and I say gee if we can to real-time
attribution we won't know

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,509
where people are coming from we can shut
them down if we don't catch

29
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,259
in advance of the Act the indicators
that might have told us something was

30
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,340
about to happen

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,320
we leave ourselves vulnerable so
everyone to get me to 24 scenario well

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,500
of course the necessary to every one of
these

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,880
scenarios becomes a justification for
some new

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,509
typeof intrusion on the user's frankly
doing nothing wrong

35
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,490
running I mean these are the people just
na online taking advantage of a service

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,229
or getting

37
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,680
caught up in the cyber war scenarios and
are now being

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
you know 11 a remember john poindexter
proposal he wanted to do he DNA

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,740
wanted to a hash every person's DNA with
every online transaction they have when

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,369
they went to website or an email

41
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,209
because that way you have perfect
authentication you know exactly what I'm

42
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,770
Asian awareness exactly where he where
do you stand on offer the case you said

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,500
a minute ago

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,950
be okay under some circumstances well
you know I think there are ways and that

45
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,819
boy to talk to this group about this
issue is really to

46
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,370
you know Santa whatever it is Newcastle
coals to Newcastle right

47
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,470
but I mean a you know speaking primarily
as a lawyer

48
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,560
I've always been intrigued by the idea
that you could separate

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,920
you know authentication from
identification and David shamah you

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,720
honor the other day had a big influence
on me because he said there should be

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,110
ways to do this

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,340
should be ways to ensure that you know
money

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,360
is moved between people in both sides
are happy

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
without exposing people to the risk of
identity theft

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,800
as you start building up huge profile so
I'm I'm still hoping that we find those

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,790
kinds of solutions those solutions that
build in

57
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,170
a strong authentication but do so in a
way that don't leave individuals

58
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,569
vulnerable to this kind of deep profile

59
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,810
but this Privacy individual identity the
sanctity of the individual if you will

60
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,220
have any common standard yesterday

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,489
a structural parts to hear ya and she
says you know

62
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,080
people tell you one thing about what
they want with privacy

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,650
but then you offer a service and I'll
give you up all this stuff

64
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,230
you know what they say and what they
want are different but thats

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,310
and then there's an issue of sovereign
to methanol and recycle you

66
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,370
to me that's always been a very unfair
question I mean let's think about this

67
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,110
one you know

68
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,780
many have you are doing online commerce
right so imagine a scenario where you

69
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,180
could say to our customers

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,360
G will give you you know five cents off
if you choose not to do

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,530
secure HTTP because it's a little
cheaper for us if you don't do it

72
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,739
and so will return the savings to you I
mean is there any scenario under which

73
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,069
would make sense to actually give people
that

74
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,810
offer to have last online security so
they can say five cents and a lot of

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,819
these privacy deals kind of have that
feel about that yep

76
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,849
I'm gonna get most people to a
vulnerability that if you think about it

77
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:07,930
for a moment why

78
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,340
why would we want to do that a little
later let me tell you that the internet

79
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,530
and our site is useful

80
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,590
that kind of pricing for surrendered
privacy every time

81
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,239
I someone or purse you a free thing you
just have to register and unregister you

82
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,410
give dad a UART

83
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,930
I mean the reason it's not free what
happens especially exciting let's take

84
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,919
that example what if the free thing
you're

85
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,350
I are offering you turns out to be you
know thats or acting right ankle

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,810
that's exactly right so the question is
now how do you deal with that problem

87
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,440
you can

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,570
of course regulated way can basically
say

89
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,880
people don't have the right to post your
pictures are themselves on Facebook they

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,000
don't have the right to get free offers

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,280
in return for giving their their
identity information up you could

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,350
regulate

93
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,259
anything that you could do you pick
educate people we are really bad at

94
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,540
educating people on operational security

95
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,180
we don't take it seriously now what you
know the effects of in a way fiving of

96
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,180
the problem I send just educate people
but

97
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,930
I would argue that when we structure our
security particularly interface between

98
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,520
that and the user

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,729
we need to construct it in a way that
takes account psychology

100
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,460
up the way people actually behaved not
the way people who are steeped in

101
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,770
security behave

102
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,910
by have the average person behaves so
that means you know

103
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,660
the way we you with passwords is often
not realistic in terms of what people

104
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,590
actually willing to do a lot on every
day that means we gotta look at other

105
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,220
kinds of systems for securing

106
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,500
that work with the psychology user and I
think that's a great area to be focused

107
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,009
on

108
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,560
as part of this effort is that a
government or I've I think frankly too

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
great

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
opportunity for the private sector
because ob

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,900
as people value privacy and security and
here I confess

112
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,820
we I do my firm does counsel people in
the cyber security space

113
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,960
so you know down shocked my sayings

114
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,240
your is an opportunity in the private
sector to

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,770
promoting that value in a way that is
efficient people

116
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,240
and we haven't done enough well i i
agree with that but I think the trick is

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,910
to

118
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,030
is to help people not make mistakes
right I mean

119
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,400
sometimes people say this is about you
know putting less on the dashboard and

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
more under the hood

121
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,460
wanna build an safeguards for the people
don't find themselves tripping up but

122
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,650
if you end up with a buncha privacy
policies for example which is how most

123
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,270
users experience privacy issues on the
Internet

124
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,130
I don't think that have been very
helpful because the privacy policies

125
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,400
basically say

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
this is how we're planning to use your
information if you're not happy about it

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
you know got another site the government
rolling all over this

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,660
is to have somebody some institution

129
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,639
that people can trust with Republicans
and Democrats on

130
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,090
with privacy rights people on it perhaps
with subpoena power

131
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,130
that protects our privacy rights in our
civil liberties

132
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,520
after the the Homeland Security
Department was created a

133
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,560
the congress mandated that there be a
privacy protection and civil liberties

134
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,280
projection

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,150
board and it's been tough choke and it
continues to be a joke on the Obama

136
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,270
administration

137
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,599
congress wanted I think we all want it
but where the where the demands to

138
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,340
actually

139
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,240
staff it and have to go out there and do
something

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,009
because of the abuses that occurred in
the last administration with an essay

141
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,729
and and others

142
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,370
we need to reestablish some government
credibility in the areas privacy rights

143
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,590
and civil liberties

144
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,919
one way to do that is to have a vigorous

145
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,130
cyber but just cyber but in general

146
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,280
civil liberties and privacy protection
boarded vigorous what

147
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,569
yeah I mean here you know I agree with
richard very much

148
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:47,180
this is all about the need to establish
oversight mechanisms

149
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,680
the equal to the new authorities who've
given government are you going to create

150
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,210
a

151
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,800
lots of new systems of surveillance and
tracking you need on the other side of

152
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,919
the balance

153
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,069
you know people with the expertise and
skills to assess

154
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,330
if they're working as they should be
work and legal authority yes and Michel

155
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,319
Therrien by there are also put in a plug

156
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
you know for the president's civil
liberties oversight board %uh this was

157
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,970
us

158
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,720
another part up the creation of Homeland
Security

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,590
post-9/11 performance and less than we
really need an independent agency in

160
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,780
this country

161
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,289
that has some authority to look into
these privacy issues isn't within a

162
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,479
single agency doesn't answer

163
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,879
you know directly to the white house I'm
in those positions have been filled and

164
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,190
it's a real disappointment at

165
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,389
it's a big disappointment for for an
administration that ran the campaign

166
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,599
if it was going to take care of these
issues but recognize your I mean the

167
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,529
issues we're dealing with in terms of

168
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,510
have what people are willing to
surrender on the Internet in terms of

169
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,849
price and how you create a system

170
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,320
that at least cautions people this
happens much too rapidly for the

171
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,720
tried for massive let's get lawyers and
the lawyers will investigate Raja

172
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,070
subpoenas hearings

173
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,410
television and someone winds up being
punished we've got to figure out a way

174
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,149
and to me seems like there's gotta be
public demand for this

175
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,540
which means the public cash to
understand what's at stake when they

176
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,690
give up elements have their identity and
it when I know how that happens

177
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,110
but I do think there's an opportunity hi
you've got season

178
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,140
now and this is where the government
could use its summits bully pulpit

179
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,450
cue explain to people what the
consequences are some with their

180
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,700
sacrifice in

181
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,440
in terms of identity theft and your
friend your business at Internap

182
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,490
beginning to use identity theft

183
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,920
as a wedge for beginning to promote
privacy protected product

184
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,209
but you've got to find ways when you
build your system's

185
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,390
you be able to allow the user to protect
privacy without being cumbersome

186
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,630
and I i'll predict this as we speak now
there may not be a great demand for this

187
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,959
but I'm very confident that at some
point something will happen

188
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,130
how that will affect consumers in a big
way and then the company or companies

189
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,470
that have the ability to say we have an
architecture to protect your security

190
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,730
privacy

191
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,100
will be I have quantum leap ahead of
everybody there is always this hot

192
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,680
action

193
00:09:59,680 --> 00:09:59,959
this
