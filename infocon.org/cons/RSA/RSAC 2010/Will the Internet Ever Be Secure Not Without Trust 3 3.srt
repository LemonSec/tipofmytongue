1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
knockin on derstand all these types of
malicious activities

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,710
and the show and i can understand all
the technology that we are developing to

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,560
put in place

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,570
as a look at that is that the
sausage-making

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,290
a bar business and Internet Security
people don't wanna wanna be available

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,309
they don't want necessarily see all of
that

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,380
we've done a lot a man on the street
interviews over the past couple years

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,590
just asking both

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,630
company employees as well as users now
asking what's important to them

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,789
the temple feedback that we get

11
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,250
is people want to ensure that they
transact on these networks

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,710
that their information is protected and
their privacy is maintained

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,920
that they're not gonna the machines are
going to get infected and they're gonna

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,719
stay safe

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,809
that they can very conveniently access
is the services they're looking for

16
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,890
if they're gonna buy some shoes are an
iPod its gonna come on time

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,289
it's gonna work it can be guaranteed so

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,399
in the end consumers and users really
just want to be able to quickly and

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,530
conveniently

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,930
identify and access trustworthy sites so
they can get their business done or get

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,070
the entertainment done

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,250
it's not about all the understanding
everything that happens and Ernie

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,400
however

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
as we know that fraud is continuing to
rise

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,780
it's becoming more and more for problem
one more challenge for users to be able

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,869
to distinguish what is trustworthy

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,479
and what isn't trustworthy as we know
structures tend to target

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,650
I sites where users spend a lot of time

29
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,990
and where they have some certain
inherent trust I think with that

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,070
resulted in

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,030
over the past couple months we've seen a
large growth and the types of malicious

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,280
a when our thats folks on social
networking sites

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,299
consumers can to trust the site

34
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,960
very much on today which is certainly
evident by the non-personal information

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,810
people line the post up there for other
people to see I also spent a lot of time

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,750
on the site

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,840
several hours a day sometimes more at
home and and courses we all know

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,290
unfortunately sometimes at work

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,750
Soter perfect storm with this really
open and trusting

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,850
group of people when you put all this
information spent all this time out

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,430
there in the social networking sites

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,489
so I want to talk about I'll one example

43
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,680
up some our that we i reasoning
identified without the help of our

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,069
research partners Avars

45
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,640
times tration are that really looked at
trying to manipulate

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,629
I consumers on the social networking
sites this case there was attacked that

47
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,450
we saw recall the bad puppy attack

48
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,700
those in that they use the sites were
starting to get very comfortable with

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,569
the paradigm

50
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,670
a receiving these virtual gifts from
friends and families

51
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,200
rather be a virtual became roses Marie
see something virtual pickle

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,209
where there's a an opportunity to
decorate a virtual room

53
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,580
we tend to trust that accept these
virtual gaps because computer 42 us from

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,860
friends or family or at least

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,890
what appears to be friends and family
and their email address

56
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,680
in this case the trustor took advantage
of that

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,830
and develop what appeared to be a nice
innocuous

58
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,690
a gift about adopting a lost puppy and
you know as you can see really cute

59
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,560
looking papillion

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,540
you know who really wouldn't want to go
ahead and adopted and on sacking out

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,360
that means

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,700
adopting a virtual poppy but you know
seems harmless

63
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,849
really what would happen here's part
this there's really a button hijacking

64
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,750
capability built into the street get

65
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,810
so that the user was to click on any
part in this this puppy attack

66
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,870
they were redirected I to another site
the server learned to them that they

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,659
were having a problem in there are some

68
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,470
temperature on our and their machine if
they're only to follow these guidelines:

69
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,590
and download the software that be able
to protect themselves

70
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,780
if the user went to and follow these
requirements

71
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,540
really resulted in the installation a
persistent rootkit

72
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,190
on their device completely compromising
their machine these types of attacks

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,879
I asked if these types ribbon around
these virtual guess

74
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,420
I really Inc you know very serious in
the way that they're roading trust

75
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,959
because they're using those email
addresses and therefore team on

76
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,620
with the email addresses the people we
trust in this case once the machine was

77
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,900
compromised of course that users email

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,989
account was then and their friends list
was then taken over

79
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,569
and is bad puppy was continue to my
really spread across the Internet

80
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,750
and impacting more machines so really

81
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,920
whether you were a individual user out
there on the internet

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,680
or even a security professional like
ourselves it's becoming more and more

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,930
difficult to be able to differentiate

84
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,160
what is really a good site and
trustworthy site or

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,870
%uh an offer or an email from one that's
that infected

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,500
this case you could be really trust that
to that puppy

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,570
you know Versailles we look at at this
concept

88
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,800
I across three real factors around users
and devices

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,520
the network and web sites on the network

90
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,710
as can talk a little bit about we have a
real strong history

91
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,370
about bring the dot-com and dotnet DNS
infrastructure

92
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,790
very high levels love liability security

93
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,110
so people can really get where they need
to go on the internet

94
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,870
across users and devices we have a
cloud-based wrong

95
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,139
medication technologies they really can
ensure that only the appropriate people

96
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,210
with the appropriate writer able to
access the account and get the

97
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,430
information at another account

98
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,780
on web sites really the core technology
driving trust because web sites

99
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,800
the last fifteen years has been SSL
technology and the combination

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,440
combination authenticating those
companies to ensure that they really who

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,940
are

102
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,979
they say they are as well as encrypting
their personal data

103
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,479
credit card information to ensure that
it cannot be hijacked

104
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,220
that's really bands are the bedrock
trust in e-commerce on the internet for

105
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,440
the past 15 years

106
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,220
really be /i that RSL has really been
focused

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,840
on the site to do transactions sites for
you to put in a credit card

108
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,430
personal information be able to encrypt
that data

109
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,650
a lot of our customers about 90,000 from
website

110
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,770
also displayed Versailles check mark on
that site in an effort to sort

111
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,940
communicate

112
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,030
to the users that there's really trust
out there

113
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,990
we estimate there about two million in
these web site they're actually doing

114
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,759
transactions in replying

115
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,710
encryption I'm SSL there also a whole
series of other sites

116
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,410
where they're not actually doing we tens
Atlanta decides

117
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,580
there are actually doing transactions
are looking for opportunities

118
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,780
to communicate to their customers a bite
site is a safe place to spend time

119
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,729
this a place to transact so last week we
introduce a new product

120
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,569
VeriSign Trust Seal which combines
really that is is that the occasion

121
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,699
to really you know authenticate that
that company as well as doing a daily

122
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,400
malware scan at that site

123
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,470
to ensure that site's not been infected
and if we do find them our that its

124
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,360
quickly remediated for the users can
really trust that site

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,770
those customers and have the ability to
display the check mark actually indicate

126
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,610
clearly and simply

127
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,930
to these consumers at this is a trusted
place

128
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,900
we also think deployment the service
will actually generally make our

129
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,889
internet neighborhood safer place

130
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,310
by I constantly doing the stealing our
scan all the sites

131
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,590
well have the ability to bury quickly
identify them our and take it down

132
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,889
before a lot of damage can be done

133
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,660
looking forward we'll be adding more
more features these products are porous

134
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,979
SLR trustseal

135
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,319
as we continue trying to protect that
Internet infrastructure

136
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,060
and provide that trust for our users

137
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,160
will be prioritizing those features that
we had based on what we hear from our

138
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
customers

139
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,530
and from their customers to really
excited about about this

140
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,030
opportunity to drive trust and security
on the network

141
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,310
so I appreciate your time now like to
turn it back over gym for some closing

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,050
thoughts

143
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,320
thank you with

144
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,860
a

145
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,200
like crap I hope you enjoy those
observations and insights from

146
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,910
Canon Fran let me just concluded by
saying that

147
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,330
looking out at the Internet I think it's
fair to say that

148
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,070
security tools are everywhere but trust
is in short supply

149
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,350
and trust is an emotion if it's not tell

150
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,910
it's not there and I think ass security
practitioners we really need to embrace

151
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,550
this

152
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,010
understand that and apply it if we don't
we're gonna let our users down

153
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,000
thank you very much
