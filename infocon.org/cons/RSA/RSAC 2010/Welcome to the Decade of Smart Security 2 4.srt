1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,520
30 solution that we've been
demonstrating here in the solution

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,519
showcase is an example how we're
assisting specific industries

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,290
in this case until these to invest in
advanced technologies that can transform

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,110
the business

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,060
while addressing the security privacy
safety and risk issues

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,279
that arise from these innovations now

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,590
the same pattern shows up in other
industries but we can easily these days

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,670
figure out the best way to get from
point A to point B

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,170
but if you happen to be in Singapore the
Singapore Land Transportation Authority

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,680
is improving what is already one of the
most modern

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,140
affordable and heavenly use public
transport networks in the world

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,539
doing this by adding an integrated
payment option

13
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,870
that can be used for the bus or the
train

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,940
parking congestion control charges

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,219
in the background the system studies
usage data

16
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,270
help design new schedules and
dynamically route

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,460
traffic so that it will further reduce
congestion

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,880
again this is a great system but it's
also clearly

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,590
operating on very very sensitive data
collecting detailed information

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,659
on who is traveling where privacy in
UserControl must be built in the

21
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,470
solutions

22
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,750
from the beginning at the Transportation
Authority had to find a way to control

23
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,590
access to this financial data

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,689
I as well as the sensitive logistical
data

25
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,979
about the travel habits above
individuals and

26
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,799
and their activities up

27
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,960
this connected world we live in is also
given this inability to access

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,890
the brightest minds a part-time
literally from anywhere

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,100
great example here's in medical imaging
where

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,820
assistant designer has developed
technology that enables medical

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,200
professionals to view

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,869
a medical images X-rays CT scans

33
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,990
MRI's via wired and mobile devices

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,810
including laptops and smartphones
literally from anywhere

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,290
now this allows doctors are not
physically present

36
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,780
but to be able to lend their expertise
and provide medical assistance and

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,509
inside

38
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,770
which is really I enabling breakthroughs
for the medical profession

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,840
but the designer this system had to find
ways

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,110
to ensure compliance with access to
personal medical data

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,129
test result in images that are being
broadcast over public networks and to

42
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:32,660
up common devices we now have the I

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,849
ability to access the security
capabilities themselves from anywhere in

44
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:37,530
the world

45
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,670
indeed at this very moment IBM

46
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,319
is remotely monitoring the security
status have companies

47
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,220
like many of those represented in this
room with software provision from the

48
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,019
cloud

49
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,959
from one of our service operation
centers around the world

50
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,140
no this capability is enabled by our
secure Web Gateway technology which

51
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,430
I is software that allows us to continue
to blur the lines between businesses

52
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,610
their partners their service providers
through

53
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,690
data-sharing and hosted cloud-based
services

54
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,790
know this drive new innovations in the
way that we can deliver security

55
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,140
like the secure Web Gateway managed
service that we also demonstrated here

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,940
dar se

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,230
again this is all during my sophomore

58
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,129
software that allowing us to drive these
innovations

59
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,409
and now with advanced software in
atlantic tools

60
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,810
we have the capability to extract value
from data

61
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,950
see patterns correlations and out liars

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,099
we'll uncover it hidden patterns in data

63
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,230
to analyze protect and control leavitt

64
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,420
your problems can be recognized and
remediated

65
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,620
before it is to like again behind every
one of these examples as a business

66
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,599
a government or an industry that's
looking good

67
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,780
unique innovative ways to leverage
software

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,069
day more than ever before these
organizations

69
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,540
aren't using software to enable every
facet of their business

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,239
but again we now know that there are
many challenges here

71
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,359
technology has allowed us to move beyond
physical locations and branch offices

72
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,949
allows us to

73
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:26,229
live in virtual worlds across a
dispersed teams and players incontinence

74
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,340
but the more data and information
organizations make available

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,560
audiences the greater the risk profile
associated with this

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,340
this access Anders as a result

77
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,090
is a new said it needs it emerged so
what is it that is changed

78
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,259
about security risk management in this
new smarter world

79
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,470
well human beings are becoming more
dependent

80
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,720
on security in our everyday lives

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
in security is appropriately now seen as
a right

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,820
every individual its copper mine

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,280
on our customers driven by what we call

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
the 3 C's complexity

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,889
cost and compliance

86
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,110
now were gathered in this room today
because a smarter planet

87
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,259
is by definition a more complex
implanted

88
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,370
more connected things driven by more
software innovation

89
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,410
and we must ensure that organizations
are proactively identifying

90
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,320
all the types abreast to business and
then we have security and resiliency

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,300
plans

92
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,229
%uh that are in place to address any
kind of threat

93
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,169
or disruption complexity is indeed

94
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,820
a security issue it's a security issue
that is here to stay

95
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,009
why because complexity crate shattering
places or people with bad intentions

96
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,060
do a lot of damage complexity create
vulnerabilities

97
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,620
we cannot have a smarter planet without
understanding the wrice

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,970
associated with all the new capabilities
and services

99
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,400
that we're going to build and depend on
to drive innovation

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,669
around the world now

101
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,770
is a very simple concept here that I
wanted a

102
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,919
communicators we're dealing with issues
%uh like

103
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,100
cyber security protecting critical
infrastructures

104
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,900
or even dealing with the issues a
privacy and identity

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,650
in all cases we just gotta be held at
the bad guys

106
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,740
we have to design security into the
services

107
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,780
from the beginning that will deliver

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,419
and drive a smarter planet this is the
essence of what we're trying to do with

109
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,560
IBM

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,020
and again we're doing this with that
thought in mind that I'd

111
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,190
mention earlier want you to remember
that

112
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:52,759
with strong business security we believe
will come strong prosperity

113
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,009
now as they headed back guys gotta be
able to see what's happening with the

114
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,979
infrastructure from the service
operations perspective and the security

115
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,169
operations perspective

116
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,120
you have to be in control in a
controlled environment

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,099
we strive to make sure that everything
is in an understood

118
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:13,870
desired state all these connected
capabilities the drive the smarter

119
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,800
planet

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,220
you have to be able to visualize what's
happening right now in that desired stay

121
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,770
in you have to be able to make sure that
you stay within the fine control limits

122
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,900
and understand the risks that are
associated with moving in and out of

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,280
these control limits

124
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,669
out control also requires automation

125
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,569
because we've seen in our work with
clients worldwide

126
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,580
that vulnerability surfaces from people
choosing not to follow

127
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,060
repeatable defined processes

128
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,210
now is a very bad powerful value
proposition

129
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,160
that really I'm talking about here in a
resonates

130
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,460
with businesses industry's and
government's

131
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,819
all across the planet this value
proposition

132
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,479
is called service management

133
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,139
yet or post conference last week we
deeply examine this notion up

134
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,319
integrated service management service
management that really connects

135
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,419
although the silos serve infrastructure
that are required for service delivery

136
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,370
this idea resonates with our clients
because it's a real value proposition

137
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,669
with a core premise the most important
things that our clients do with the

138
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,979
technology infrastructures they deploy

139
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,240
is the liver service that supports the
business process

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,659
that at the end of the day is important
to a business outcome

141
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,820
in that's where that's what's really
important

142
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,480
about the service a from a security
perspective

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,750
that service is built on a set the
physical assets

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,730
with built-in intelligence storing
processing or collecting

145
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,130
huge amounts of information that are all
network-connected

146
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,730
it's important the note that these
intelligent connected asset

147
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,430
really spend multiple asset classes not
just

148
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,519
IT staff can be transportation vehicles

149
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,250
traffic control devices the buildings
and of course

150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,700
it's the digital assets like design
documents are indeed the software

151
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,850
applications

152
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,089
that supports composite applications all
these things

153
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,519
are now part up the smarter services
that we are delivering them will be

154
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,750
delivering

155
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,830
a key element to the smarter decade will
be the

156
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,190
capability to manage all these assets
across

157
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,209
although the spectrum with an and a
great sense of working to build these

158
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,459
