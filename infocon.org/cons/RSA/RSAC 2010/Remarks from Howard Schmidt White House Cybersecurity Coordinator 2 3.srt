1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,720
and economic growth we built this system

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,379
many penis room like witness only other
folks have been

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,019
part to the success of this thing me to
make sure we continue that

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,969
we don't wind up doing things that are
gonna hamper innovation

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,660
one of the key things also that thinks
important understand more talk about the

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,310
role as

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,789
reside within a national security staff
which is sort of a new term for some

8
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:25,330
people

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,439
because the national security staff is a
combination what used to be the national

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,019
security

11
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,680
council staff in home & Security Council
within the executive officer the

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,829
president we brought these things
together

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,500
it is necessary but the representatives
the team that I work with and some

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,190
I'm very close player pleased to have
here with me today our representatives

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,489
from

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,960
NSA Department Defense Department of
Commerce Department justice

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,329
the officer director out the National
Intelligence

18
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,719
and Homeland Security and we're building
some more looking for ways to make sure

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,730
that we have a comprehensive view

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,949
what's going on and also wanna make sure
that everybody understands

21
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,110
that over the past year and I'm gonna
speak in a minute what that milestone is

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,470
these people been hard at work they've
been working with many %uh view than

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,770
working internally amongst other
government agencies

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,979
a they put literally thousands about
hours have invested time

25
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,200
into working to solve some these
problems and wanna talk about those in a

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,930
few moments

27
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,869
because these accomplishments and I'm
gonna be talking about are direct result

28
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,070
of the work they've done

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,130
over the past year we also

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,590
make sure that the president and his key
advisers are thinking about

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,400
cybersecurity in everything they do

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,430
that's very important as we know when
you start looking at the reserve

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,960
governance risk and compliance

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,600
what are the key issues of governance is
you have to have the leadership from the

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,189
top

36
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,869
many of us have spent our careers
started at the bottom

37
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,460
pushing up saying this is important we
need to pay much more attention to it

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,299
and market prices stakeholders earnings
per share all those things have been an

39
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,000
impediment the past we've recognized
that cybersecurity

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,469
enhances those things no longer an
impediment so leadership from the top is

41
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,790
important and we see that you'll see

42
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,009
out for the rest the week for some the
other government officials will be here

43
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,599
that really paying attention we get it
when you know that President Obama if

44
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,140
you've seen a speech is a mate
cybersecurity a policy within his

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,020
administration

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,920
May 29th at last year was was was
probably one of the most tremendous

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,140
advance that i've seen

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,160
in our business we have the present
United States stand up and make a

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,239
historic speech

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,200
it says very specifically cyber threat
is one of the most serious

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,849
economic and national security
challenges we face that america's

52
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,120
economic prosperity in the 21st century
will depend

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,150
on cybersecurity and was not a light
statement in anybody's ever work in

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,290
government you're trying to

55
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,519
due to form something like that you have
to make sure your precise

56
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,480
so as a result of that he will also
announce a release the cybersecurity

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,150
policy review which I'm gonna talk about
here in a few moments

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,099
because it's important to make sure that
this we're talking about the progress

59
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,250
we've made on that

60
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,909
in the efforts to go ahead and if any
information in for him

61
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,519
communications infrastructure now

62
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,629
what are some other things that have
they've taken place as we move forward

63
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,129
on this

64
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,730
well what are the foundations aspects of
the policy was to develop

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,629
some transparency and accountability in
cybersecurity

66
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,840
for that reason today I want to quickly
go through some other

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,510
updates on where we are in attended the
items that we talked about

68
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,269
which with the new near-term action
items the cyber policy review

69
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,200
there's a lot of work to be done we know
the president said it you know it I know

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,110
we all know this is not a so were bought
by wanna make sure that you understand

71
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,379
the progress made over the past nine
months

72
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,200
the first one and number one pretty easy
present studies on appoint somebody

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,340
in here i am. he wants to make sure that
there's a

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,500
a senior policy person working musicians
across government second thing

75
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,610
we need update the strategy

76
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,470
there's lotta strategies image we've
done in the past but make sure that

77
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,970
we're looking at it in today's
terminology

78
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,360
and to adjust as necessary there's a lot
of things that have remained the same

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,610
we still are vulnerabilities which job
resilience is restored issues

80
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,080
we need to make sure it's updated the
third thing we

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,620
we look at is the idea of bringing

82
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,739
are sure the private sector in this
discussion

83
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,090
and making sure that the richness a
robust as our environments are still

84
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,889
there

85
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,220
now these ten things it it talks about
the strategy

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,570
and when we start looking at number
three that the third item the

87
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,560
when we were talking about the outfit
the near term policies

88
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,509
we want to make sure that we're looking
at the privacy

89
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,570
and the issue about the president's
management agenda

90
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,430
there's been a lot of discussion about
FISMA think a lot of us have said at one

91
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,280
time or another

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,240
FISMA you can because my complaint is
still not be secure

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,810
and we agree that there's work needs to
be done with that

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,850
so next month the office of management
and budget will be releasing in

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,280
announcing the new fiscal year two
thousand ton

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,100
10 FISMA performance metrics which will
become a priority for each and every

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,970
department

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,560
but after an extensive review with both
private sector industry stakeholders

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,539
government people

100
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,270
I'm pleased to say these new metrics
begin to move us

101
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,470
from a static compliance based metrics
program 20

102
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,720
continuous monitoring capability that
will help provide

103
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,979
agency department in White House
leadership with real time

104
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,070
situation awareness inventory's
configurations incidents in training for

105
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,990
what we need to do

106
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,710
across government systems item number
four

107
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,320
his designate a privacy and civil
liberties per professional with an

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,100
organization which is done

109
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,110
with that person is now on board number
five

110
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,750
we need to make sure that we understand
that

111
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,310
were leading an interagency government
legal analysis

112
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,630
the work that we're doing there's a
lotta legal issues about we do in Scott

113
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,120
only

114
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,229
touched on a few on this morning
thinkers forty-some odd legal questions

115
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:08,509
we've got to work through

116
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,150
the next time on a list that we're
looking at is how do we create an

117
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,410
international

118
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,990
and national awareness and education
campaign to promote cyber security

119
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,090
many was know about Cyber Security
Awareness Month in October

120
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,180
last summer the White House pull
together an interagency working group to

121
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,289
look at this area

122
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,340
the working group and divided the work
in the four tracks

123
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,039
track one national awareness campaign
led by DHS

124
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,590
track to a formal cybersecurity
education led by Department of Education

125
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,740
the third is a federal work force
structure led by the Office of Personnel

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,930
Management Department defense

127
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,380
number four the national workforce
training led by the partner Homeland

128
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,949
Security Department of Defense

129
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,050
and Director of National Intelligence
these are actively meeting come up with

130
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,550
plans are meeting your goals they have
milestones

131
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,229
we're making good progress in that area

132
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:00,430
next time we have on there is when we
start looking at

133
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,470
the international cybersecurity policy I
know some a viewer from the

134
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,699
international audience here

135
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,930
we need to make sure that our policy in
framework is addressing the

136
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,300
international press

137
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,800
were making sure the worst ablution the
norms internationally to make sure that

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,840
we have a clear understanding that were
not impacting

139
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,930
private industry while governments argue
about things

140
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,949
the next item we have on the list that I
wanna just really quickly touch on

141
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,120
is instrument as the cyber security is a
response plan

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,160
there should never be a question where
private sector needs to go

143
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,699
during an incident there should never be
a question about how do we coordinate

144
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,210
how we wind up making sure

145
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,880
that the resource is a private sector
and government are being

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,099
tethered together to make sure we're
doing things right I know

147
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,569
secretary Napolitano's gonna talk more
about this tomorrow I'm not going to get

148
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,639
into a lot of detail on this cruise

149
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,050
DHS those folks doing a great job bonus
together

150
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,940
the next item on the list is the issue
of how we wind up

151
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,979
I'll let me get the scroll thing come on
folks running out of time here

152
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,680
there we go develop a framework for
research and development

153
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,710
we know all too well that is lotto

154
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,560
researchers got needs to be done both
near-term and long-term

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,199
discipline work with this office size
technology policies been working on this

156
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,879
issue

157
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,139
we're looking at a couple specific
projects that came outta this

158
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,879
about cyber leap year project which is
one

159
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,120
how do we deal with amor moving target
defense

160
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,029
because no two attacks ever seem to be
the same and also how do we do Taylor

161
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,459
trust basis

162
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,779
as was talk about this morning how do we
do only what we need to do

163
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,250
but still have the ability to do more
things when necessary

164
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,310
don't think we have to look at from the
RD perspective is the economic peace

165
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,680
summit

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,390
I think it's vitally important we not
lose sight of that then lastly in

167
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,940
something near and dear to many of our
hearts as the issue about a

168
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
cybersecurity based

169
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,089
identity management strategy we've got a
lot of people coming together we need to

170
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,540
make sure that as we work on a strategy

171
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,160
that we pour these pieces together we
were looking at it from a secure online

172
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,519
transaction capability

173
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,589
a couple things we need to make sure one
first and foremost to make sure it's

174
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,230
interoperable

175
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,709
we need to make sure that one size does
not fit all depending on the device

176
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,740
you're working with

177
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,820
its so I wanna then switch now

178
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,220
too I think what i think is probably one
of the most important pieces we've got

179
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,420
about this

180
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,459
and as I mentioned in my earlier
comments about the transparency

181
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:33,100
and the ability to look at security

182
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,510
summit mayor where that there was a

183
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,870
comprehensive national cybersecurity
initiative that took place couple years

184
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,640
ago

185
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,610
well like to start my closure but
talking about a quote from President

186
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,010
Obama

187
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,370
in a memo to all departments and
agencies he said my administration is

188
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,190
committed to creating and presented

189
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,540
level openness in government

190
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,769
as I said earlier something we're doing
as well in a cybersecurity

191
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,330
aspect ever we need to do as well
