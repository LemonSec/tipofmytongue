1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,199
they're doing it and but but but you see
this is the problem of course with

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,430
Einstein 2 and Einstein 3 another

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,639
you know government initiated network
detection methods

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,509
you know to their the you know
recognition I'm in Sparta their mission

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:12,830
that

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,410
that's part about the NSA i suppose to
do they're supposed to a

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,600
locate that content but if you put them
in the security business and they're

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,609
looking for malware

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,880
you cannot put on Thursday things to the
businesssave looking

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,990
at things in the United States gonna
throw line

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,269
go find somebody other than that I say
we have to move the Burton

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,010
to the ISP's and other places you know I
think or else

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,329
but there's another issue here which is
what what can government do we're all

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,010
afraid of government regulation and
government in your privacy

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,559
what can government do to help solve
this problem that doesn't raise these

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,579
these these hairy issue and one thing
you can do

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,030
is relate to other governments right now
cyber crime pays

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,020
let's just be upfront about it
cybercrime is not script kiddies anymore

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,280
it's very sophisticated international
gangs that work

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,809
with the connivance support the
government Russia and the government of

21
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:05,250
China

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,220
and we talked to russia and China about
a lot of things

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,530
we don't ever make this a big issue and
we've never tried

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,930
to structure an international solution

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,450
getting other countries involved as
we've done on money laundering and so

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,259
many other things

27
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,590
we've never done it on cybersecurity and

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,290
why is that will because I think people
in the government don't understand this

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:28,759
issue

30
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,829
to a very large no I don't think that's
part for I think I'll

31
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,860
the big problem has been attribution hi
something emanates from a particular

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,549
country now we have the attack since
Tony we take action Georgia

33
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,619
I let's assume first two more with the
server which appears to be

34
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,619
genesis in fact hi not just in emission

35
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,729
third party it's been hijacked even show
you have to ask a question

36
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,579
if the government for security the
government turned a blind eye to witness

37
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,710
the government simply

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,469
incapable of dealing with it is when
it's hard to prove is a way of solving

39
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,780
witches have an international treaty
that put an obligation on every country

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,899
to police its own cyberspace and so you
don't care whether was the government

41
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,970
or whether it was some hacker club that
the KGB

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,540
refs be didn't know about it so they
could be such a thing you know we have

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,360
to get over our government

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,870
hang up on having arms control in
cyberspace we've got fiber Warner

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,569
alright because this fiber command with
weapons a four-star general

46
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,099
and we have no strategy that anybody
knows about and we have no arms control

47
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,830
well we there is no Arkham cyber warfare
yet there is no

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,160
military college teaching this kinda
stuff nonetheless

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,580
are we carrying out cyber offense
against other countries first-year

50
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,650
say more no look if you think that the
the story was true that the

51
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,319
China or somebody has lace the US
electric power grid with logic bombs

52
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,340
me I think you have to be naive to
assume that we haven't done that

53
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,360
China yeah and what's ordered situation
is that with backup

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,640
what if that Wall Street Journal story
and said plastic explosives were found

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,239
on the high tension

56
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,840
distribution waters throughout the
United States and we have reason to

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,599
believe that the people who put them
there were Chinese agents

58
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,260
no we wouldn't the congress would go
crazy

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,360
they wouldn't serve Chinese food in the
cafeteria you know all

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,930
Chris all the usual going to stop

61
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,970
freedom charmaine freedom tournament
with her

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,110
the but you make it a larger

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,900
bomb and nobody notices but I i get i
think im you know

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,799
party the problem here is it is the
difficulty of proving

65
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,690
wear something competition we said that
every country is responsible

66
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,780
for policing with its within its own
borders and then it turns out someone

67
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,220
from another country has hijacked
computers in our own country who

68
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,780
and then the question becomes Marco
relate to this

69
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,939
sure the US government has now an
obligation to shut that down but but wat

70
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,959
tam was going to say that violates my
for him and privacy right

71
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,790
so other countries are gonna turn to us
and say well you got an obligation to

72
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,780
shut this down

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,060
we don't care but the fourth amendment
do it that's what makes this a very

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,269
very well you know I it's not that hard
but let our company let me just come

75
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,579
back to richard's point cuz I don't
think it's true

76
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,889
that at this point the United States is
ignoring

77
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,460
the international dimension in fact I
think secretary Clinton's recent speech

78
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,790
on internet freedom was almost a direct
response

79
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,550
to the Chinese hacking incident
involving Google now she had to walk

80
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,530
a careful line there in part because of
the attribution problem

81
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,590
nephew not absolutely certain about what
you can say at least in public

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,380
you're going to be cautious but the way
in which she elevated the issue and if

83
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,870
you read the speech

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,490
I think it's fairly clear that she was
saying to the Chinese government listen

85
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,780
we're aware of this

86
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,870
or not going to ignore so that pieces
and have a cheese on willing to engage

87
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,449
in cyber arms control well that that may
be the next step but let's also say that

88
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,470
the united states you know through the
Council of Europe

89
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,289
pushed very aggressively to get support
for the cybercrime convention over the

90
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,130
last

91
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,419
you know five years in russia didn't
sign it and there's no sanction

92
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,570
yes but your criticism was that the
United States government wasn't doing

93
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,039
enough to read article

94
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,500
arms control and I think we're beginning
to see the government

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,660
take those steps up from the privacy
perspective look we don't have a big

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,380
problem with promoting sensible policies

97
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,550
and people working together we're gonna
have concerns at the point that someone

98
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,750
comes along and says

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,110
now we want user authentication and now
we want some other

100
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,160
you know technique that's gonna you know
catch everybody's a

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,190
online activity even if you don't like
to eat welcome back to the fourth

102
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,030
amendment

103
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,030
so the attack the russian attack on
Georgia

104
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,030
in part emanated from a server in
Brooklyn

105
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,370
and once you can establish that

106
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,860
you can go toward the you their service
level agreements are also two ways

107
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,110
you can go in and stop there's no the
fourth amendment

108
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,150
variability do that rapidly and the
Billy

109
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,550
you that in every instance is going to
be a potential ops

110
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm not disagreeing by the way I think
that there should be I think there is a

111
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,650
commonality

112
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,419
interest to some degree for example
every country that use the global

113
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,850
financial system

114
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,139
i has its stake maintaining the
integrity that system

115
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,729
something that corrupted trust in the
financial system globally would affect

116
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,229
Chinese and the Russians at in the same
way that affects the US

117
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:28,550
so I think it your art areas where there
is room for this kind have

118
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,069
incremental movement second thing I
think we need to do is

119
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,020
and this is part of a cybersecurity
initiative which we in ordinary a couple

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,860
years ago I think I spoke to this group
about it

121
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,860
a couple years ago and now finally it's
been at least

122
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,740
summaries been declassified a couple
days ago party that is to you

123
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,080
really think through the strategy in the
21st century for cyber

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,210
attacks that as we thought through the
Cold War and

125
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,180
and nuclear deterrence and that means
doing almost another project solarium

126
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,830
when you bring together people

127
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,380
who think through what are the
architectural problems legal problems

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,690
diplomatic problems I do we need a clear
policy

129
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,930
retaliation you need to say what their
red lines or

130
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,370
what we do in this case you're in that
case hard issues

131
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,479
we may disagree but I we've got to start
talking about this and we have not

132
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,050
really gotten very far and

133
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,270
definitely going to be a public
discussion I'm because right now it's

134
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,180
all classified top secret

135
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,710
and the public doesn't know about it
media doesn't know about that the

136
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,400
congress doesn't know about it

137
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,680
and that's a recipe for making mistakes
as grueling as all that might be

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,750
we have precedent ways of handling it
you know we had attribution problems

139
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,150
with a brush fire wars in assassinations
we took care of that

140
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,349
we had the various ways oppressing
people to change your

141
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,780
with mutually assured destruction and I
assume there some cyber version

142
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,830
that I'm not sure there is but okay

143
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,520
maybe there's a version that but there's
a whole other half for the problem

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,340
away from great powers and their gangs

145
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,280
a North Korea tax you all what you gonna
do go after the 10k pros they have in

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
that country

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,710
you know what it was that will you
counter that small states that harbor

148
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,860
criminals so exactly so pardon the

149
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,250
the reason deterrence doesn't work in
cyberspace

150
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,270
is attribution number one but number two

151
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,379
you could be attacked by a north korea
we know north Korea has engaged in

152
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,680
cyberattacks

153
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,550
on South Korea and on the United States
on the last fourth of July

154
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,270
there was a major North Korean attack on
systems in the United States

155
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,750
they launch those attacks from China
because they have so little collectivity

156
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,680
in their own country

157
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,110
meaning but to say you can have mutual
assured destruction

158
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,120
there's nothing to attack yeah

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,459
we're going to rio need to move forward
well you know but cyber

160
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,040
cyberwar against cyber war you they need
to have cyber systems

161
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,380
when we went into Afghanistan in 2001

162
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,580
I asked dennis et to develop a plan to
attack

163
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Afghanistan also with fiber or check
ready came back to me is that

164
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,600
what they should do you think we're
going to attack yeah

165
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,910
well but actually have reason other upon
which we haven't discussed

166
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,440
a certain Elmander strategy obscene
vulgar question a deterrence and how you

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,269
deal with

168
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,610
people who attack department is
resilience its building the capability

169
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,269
to deal with the fact that your cyber
assets may be impaired

170
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,470
and I you know sometimes you its
mechanical

171
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,170
fix something you need to be able to
shot of something if in fact

172
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,279
someone get into it in cyberspace
sometimes its redundancy sometimes

173
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,269
frankly

174
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,940
and maybe hearses say this year it is a
low-tech response

175
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,680
I mean you know I find if I have a
really important document I printed out

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,940
I know that's really kinda caveman staff
but you know

177
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,110
no one can hack into a paper document
even show sometimes using different

178
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,100
levels of Technology

179
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,560
I introduce Islamic resilient either in
cash to be part of a strategy

180
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,290
there was a guy who said if you don't
want if you want to keep something

181
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,040
secret don't put it on a computer

182
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,810
there she met and so you know there's
something to that there are some simple

183
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,060
thing
