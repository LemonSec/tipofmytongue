1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,590
we need a public strategy and we need
arms control to

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,710
punishment against offenders well to
yeah that's for the arms control

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,170
no up to is to deal with the cyber
espionage problem because we really are

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,849
losing our competitive advantage

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,890
and I think the government can deal with
cyber espionage

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,300
without telling every company that needs
to master cybersecurity

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,340
and the third thing is to go after
cybercrime and

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,750
and have real punishment for the
International sanctuaries

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,430
for cybercriminals if you look at those
three problems

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,520
cyberwar and the risk that we

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,540
run from the instability there are cyber
espionage and we know who's doing that

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,739
and there are ways in

13
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,739
using all the powers of government to go
after that

14
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,079
and then finally going after the
cybercriminals as part of an

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,510
international cooperation mechanism I
think government can handle some of

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,620
those three issues

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,090
fairly well we don't need focus on them

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,899
and not just wave are handling a lot of
cyber security problems and we expect

19
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,239
everybody to do their bit

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,680
I agree with their catechism those
important objectives I actually think a

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,330
comprehensive cyber chic

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,430
security strategy actually addresses
that problem I'm glad it's been

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,290
declassified like two years ago I said I
thought we ought to talk about it

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,979
publicly

25
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,049
but now we've got to implement and I
think frankly I

26
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,979
we are doing on steroids so my best
outcomes we do that

27
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,290
didn't have a second part in my best
outcome is people in the private sector

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,130
identify an opportunity

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,100
do you think I did a box with
alternative technologies that will

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,170
address this issue my worst fear is

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,030
we wind up talking about a lot more had
I

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,600
bring about a lot more we don't do right
back there is no action had I worried

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,030
dicks were scenario had a

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,560
really big call right and I and II am I

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,680
I would like to believe we're going to
get the best arm

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,390
I think though it's in our hands to
purchase

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,860
that have right and you think that's
achievable

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,210
you think your scenario is achievable I
think it's achievable if we if we have a

39
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,420
limited goals

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,070
and we focus on it meaning rather than
trying to solve all the world's

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,679
security problems at once right okay

42
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,090
that's all we have time for let's give
our panelists a handover

43
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,700
okay

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,560
and along the neck down thank you very
much
