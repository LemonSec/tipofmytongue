1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,900
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Founder, Chairman

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,533
of the Board, and Chief
Executive Officer,

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,966
Fortinet, Ken Xie.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,766
>> KEN XIE: Thank you.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,333
I'm very happy to see a
lot of friends here and I

6
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,666
have been in the industry
for thirty years, three

7
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:37,500
companies, and I see the
whole space growing a lot.

8
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:41,866
Like, compared to twenty,
thirty years ago, the

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,133
industry, unlike today,
it's over a hundred billion.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,133
So, network security is
starting to become the

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,033
biggest sector.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,899
It is over 20 billion,
overtaking the endpoint

13
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:55,333
security like ten years
ago and it is still

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,666
growing very, very fast.

15
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,898
So, for me, luckily, going
through all of these three

16
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:05,633
generations of network
security, so my previous

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,333
company, NetScreen, so we
led the first generation,

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,033
we called it
connection-based security

19
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,233
which is a firewall VPN, a
lot of companies actually

20
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,833
in the first generation
are still using it today.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,666
So, I sold my previous
company, NetScreen, to

22
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:25,633
Juniper for $4 billion
and then started Fortinet

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,500
twenty years ago.

24
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,799
We called it
the second generation,

25
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,533
called content security.

26
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,866
Basically, look beyond the
connection, inside the

27
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,833
content, inside
the application.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,366
So, that is how the UTM
firewall started and it is

29
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:46,200
starting to become the
most network security today.

30
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,766
But then the industry
still keeps changing and

31
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,900
we are now in the third stage, the third generation.

32
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:55,798
We call it infrastructure
security now.

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,433
So, what is the difference
between the first two

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,133
generations and the
current generation?

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,500
The first two generations,
we called perimeter security.

36
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:08,966
So, the firewall we called
the security gateway

37
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,232
deployed where the
internet connection and

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,333
the company internal
network on the edge.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,366
So, because inside the
company you connect by

40
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,500
switch, so that's where
they only care about the

41
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,199
connectivity and speed.

42
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,698
They don't check
what is the content,

43
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,965
what is the application.

44
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:29,366
So, that is where the
firewall, the UTM firewall

45
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,099
helps you check the
content, the application,

46
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,698
the user divest level.

47
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:38,399
So, that is where the
primary security is and -

48
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:41,500
but there is a lot being
seen changing today,

49
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,433
making the perimeter
security no longer enough

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
because the network
security protocol, even

51
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,566
after these thirty or
forty years in the internet

52
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,233
space, they're still
running the same protocol.

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,466
They still don't go beyond
the connectivity and speed.

54
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:00,000
So, that's where the
perimeter security started

55
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,866
to create some issues.

56
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,166
You can see that's how
those companies here

57
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:09,900
coming here today and the
devices get much smarter.

58
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,900
So, I know also the
programs running on the

59
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:17,166
devices also have a lot of
extra content, have a lot of

60
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,066
executables and
also a lot of

61
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,599
agent-based attacks happen.

62
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,633
There are so many ways you
can connect today, making

63
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,699
the security more
difficult, especially

64
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,366
network security.

65
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,900
So, that's where we're facing
a lot of challenges today.

66
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,699
And for all these IT
people, you also get so

67
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:39,698
many products, so many
companies you have to manage.

68
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,766
So, that is all creating
a challenge for us.

69
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:48,666
And that's the reason you
can see today's attack breach.

70
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,233
So, this is data by IBM.

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,699
So, per attack costs
over $3 million.

72
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,965
And then there are
billions of attacks every

73
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,299
year happening.

74
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,800
So, that is making us have
all the job security here,

75
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,199
but at the same time, we
have to deal with it.

76
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:08,233
How to reduce that hack,
how to make the data more

77
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,733
safe, right, so that is
what we're facing today.

78
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:17,399
So, from the traditional
perimeter security, how we

79
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:21,533
want to go next, so that's
where we believe security

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,833
keeps expanding,
especially network security.

81
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,100
So, go to the one side,
that's where the SD-WAN,

82
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,600
that's where the 5G,
that's all the other

83
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,100
whatever goes
inside the Internet.

84
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,133
And also, they also need
to go internal, go through

85
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
traditional network space.

86
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,100
That's how the Wi-Fi
space, that's how the

87
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,266
switching, that's inside
the company network and

88
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,566
what we call the
internal segmentation.

89
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,733
So, that is where we keep
expanding the network

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,666
security space.

91
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,066
That's where I believe
network security will keep

92
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,466
growing, even though it is
already the biggest sector

93
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,199
for the whole
cybersecurity, but still a

94
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,266
lot of potential
to keep it growing.

95
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,033
So that's when we talk
about a third generation

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,199
we call infrastructure
security, right?

97
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,966
So, that's where we need
to keep and deal with a

98
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:13,800
lot of new connections,
whether coming from 5G,

99
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:14,733
coming from IoT.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,600
We have to deal with a lot
of devices, bring your own

101
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,933
device to the workplace,
and all this data

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,533
goes to the Cloud.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,833
And also, all of these
different applications, right?

104
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:31,100
Not just whatever you use
in the workplace, but also

105
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,800
a lot of data goes home
and at the same time, all

106
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:37,633
of your appliances
get connected.

107
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:40,199
So that's where today,
even the network security,

108
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,800
we need to target a
whole infrastructure.

109
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,866
Wherever there is a
connection, we then see

110
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,366
how network security
can be applied.

111
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,800
That's why we call it
infrastructure security.

112
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:56,366
I do believe going
forward, we call it

113
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,466
security driven
networking.

114
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:02,833
The reason is really up to
today, you can look at a

115
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,966
network protocol.

116
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,866
They're still the same
compared to thirty, forty

117
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,199
years ago when the
internet started.

118
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,800
They still run a TCP/IP.

119
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,466
They still run a
routing protocol.

120
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,500
So, the switch, they
still only deal with

121
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:19,000
connectivity and speed.

122
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:23,232
So, that is only working
in a trusted environment.

123
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,066
And in security you
usually deal with what's

124
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,198
the bad content or
intrusion, whatever,

125
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,899
try to block it.

126
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,699
You don't deal with
all the good traffic.

127
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:37,366
So, the network security -
security driven networking

128
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:41,033
is really how to make it
as well, working together.

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Like an example,
so we're a company.

130
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,832
We put up what we call
a secure SD-WAN because

131
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,966
SD-WAN is the first time
you look at an application

132
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,300
layer and then you
decide how the traffic may

133
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:55,332
go through it.

134
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,133
So, securities of the
device go above the

135
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,566
connectivity and go above
the connection there and

136
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,466
look into what's the
content, what's the

137
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,633
application, what's the
user, what's the device,

138
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,933
where the traffic is
coming from, and then make

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,466
a decision whether to
block it or let it go through.

140
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,699
But they can also deal
with the good traffic,

141
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,366
make sure they have a
different priority,

142
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,066
different quality control.

143
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:23,133
And so, that's how secure
SD-WAN is starting to take

144
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,166
off as a huge market today
because that's the first

145
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:29,533
time the networking
side started looking at

146
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,899
applications to decide
how to more efficiently

147
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,466
do the networking.

148
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,233
I do believe once you
combine network security

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,733
together, you can base on
the content to decide on

150
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,766
how you want to
allow the traffic.

151
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,199
You can depend
on the user.

152
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,266
You can depend
on the device.

153
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,199
You can depend on wherever
the data comes from to

154
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,533
make the decision to
allow the traffic.

155
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,100
So, that is, I believe,
going forward, probably

156
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,699
the next generation
of internet.

157
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,966
The routing protocol, the
networking protocol, the

158
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,333
switching protocol, with
the networking based on

159
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,100
the content, based on the
application, based on the

160
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,832
device, based on the user,
based on where the data

161
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,633
comes from or how
important it is to make a

162
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,166
decision on how to
do the networking.

163
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:15,800
That is called security
driven networking and that

164
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,566
has a huge potential
going forward.

165
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,666
So, that's the first topic I wanted to share a little bit.

166
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,733
The second one actually
is about - this is - the

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,600
slides come from Gartner.

168
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,399
So, you can see a lot of
companies here try to

169
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:35,700
address the Cloud, but by
this Gartner slide, they

170
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,199
say the edge and immersive
technology will eat the

171
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,732
Cloud in the
next few years.

172
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,066
Just like twenty, thirty
years ago, the PC and

173
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:50,000
servers replaced
the mainframe.

174
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,566
And then five to ten years
ago, the Cloud and mobile

175
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,366
device replaced a lot
of PCs and servers.

176
00:08:57,433 --> 00:09:02,100
So, going forward, the
edge and the wearable

177
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,033
device, the immersive
device will start to

178
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,899
replace the
Cloud and mobile.

179
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,000
So, that is by Gartner.

180
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,733
I do believe there is
quite a lot of good

181
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,699
reasoning behind it.

182
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,833
That is how we want to
address how we want to

183
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,033
deal with the
future trend.

184
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,966
The reason is quite
obvious, right?

185
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,600
So, as we're looking at
how Cloud can deal with

186
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,299
security, this is the
research by NISA.

187
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,633
They just published the
research more recently.

188
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,733
So, by going to the
Cloud, you are not adding

189
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,366
additional security.

190
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:39,333
You are actually more
vulnerable because you

191
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,533
need to deal with sharing
your data with other tenancy.

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,233
You have to deal
with access control.

193
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,433
You have to deal with all
of the supply chain or the

194
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,799
other things that are
probably not in your

195
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,899
control because you have
to put the data somewhere.

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,766
So, that is where the
Cloud transition looks for

197
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,533
some issues,
critical issues.

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,299
They do add some easy
management parts, but

199
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:03,433
there is other
tradeoffs, right?

200
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,100
That is where you need to
do deal with both, both the

201
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,666
edge and the security stack
are more and more important.

202
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:15,199
You can see how this edge
and security and Cloud all

203
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,333
integrate together,
how compact it is.

204
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,399
It is really -
it is everywhere.

205
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:27,799
But also, you can look and
the reasons really, 98% of

206
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:33,066
data is generated on the
edge, not by the Cloud.

207
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,700
And also, by Gartner,
almost 80% of data from

208
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,000
the edge never
travels to the Cloud.

209
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,532
So, this has to be
working together.

210
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,700
Otherwise, you don't see
80% of data in the Cloud.

211
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,699
And also, most of the data
generated in the edge, you

212
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,533
better process there
to be more efficient.

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
So that's I say, all this
Cloud and edge are better

214
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,700
working together, and
going forward, edge will

215
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:01,766
play a more and more
important role.

216
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,666
So, for the enterprise, it
will be better if you deal

217
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,866
with both Cloud and edge
in your own data center.

218
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,165
That is where just a lot
of Cloud providers even

219
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:18,366
extend their Cloud into
the company data center,

220
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,066
whether that or
some other one.

221
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:23,266
So, that is how important
it is to address the whole

222
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,100
infrastructure,
not just the Cloud.

223
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,466
Also, you need
to have the edge.

224
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,399
You also need to have
whatever you have in your

225
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,633
enterprise environment.

226
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,100
So, that's how I see this
Cloud and edge will play

227
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,166
going forward.

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,766
So, the third thing I want
to share is where, like I

229
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,899
said, in the last thirty,
forty years, network

230
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,966
protocol is
still the same.

231
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,633
They only address the
connectivity and speed.

232
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,799
But the speed increases
almost one million times.

233
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:57,699
Right?

234
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,165
From when we deal with
like, a kilobyte, a

235
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,099
megabyte, now it's a
gigabyte, terabyte now.

236
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,033
But they still run
the same protocol.

237
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,066
They still only connect
you together in the trusted

238
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:10,466
environment and nothing
beyond that connectivity.

239
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:15,466
But look at how the
security gateway - network

240
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,666
security gateway is doing
in the last twenty,

241
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:21,599
thirty, forty years.

242
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,100
From thirty years ago,
it was a very simple firewall.

243
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,966
We called it
connectivity security.

244
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,666
The firewall would decide
who can connect, who

245
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,866
cannot connect because
attacks a lot of the time

246
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,399
are very simple.

247
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,033
You need to be interactive
to be connected and hacked

248
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,200
because storage is
not quite there.

249
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,500
It is very expensive.

250
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,200
You cannot put an agent
into whatever the device there.

251
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,433
And also, there is
limited computing power.

252
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,166
So, that is where
connecting - we called it

253
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,733
connection-based attacks
working quite well.

254
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,399
Then twenty years ago when
I started Fortinet, we

255
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,899
said, we need to go look
at the content, we need to

256
00:12:56,966 --> 00:13:00,166
look inside applications
because most attacks come

257
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,233
from permitted
connections.

258
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:06,500
That is how the virus, how the intrusion, how this comes in.

259
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,933
So, that is where the
content security,

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,399
application security, all
of this, the firewall,

261
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,866
UTM, all started.

262
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,633
So, then you deal with
four or five functions,

263
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,333
not just a firewall or
VPN but also intrusion

264
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,466
prevention, antivirus, the
web content screening, a

265
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,033
lot of things.

266
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,966
But these devices also
stick together with

267
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:28,866
network devices.

268
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,933
They need to be online
to stop the bad traffic.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Even if they don't have
the good traffic, they

270
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:36,233
have to be online to
stop the bad traffic.

271
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,266
And today, you can see the
network security gateway,

272
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,533
how many functions, how
many applications we have

273
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,966
to deal with.

274
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:48,333
Easily, ten to twenty
functions we have to deal with.

275
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,433
So, all of these functions
need a lot of computing power.

276
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,299
So, that is the challenge
we have, really, how to

277
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,699
have all of this computing
power to deal with all of

278
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:01,966
this kind of content level,
all of this kind of data

279
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:07,333
and which is in a very
fast networking environment.

280
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,833
So, there is a huge
computing power gap

281
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,033
because the process of
network traffic is still

282
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,299
the same protocol.

283
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,199
It can be very, very
easy, very, very fast.

284
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,433
On average, network
security, especially on a

285
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,266
gateway level, they need
about one hundred times

286
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,000
the computing power to
process the same surplus,

287
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,933
the same traffic on a
switch and loading basis.

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,899
So, that is the challenge
that we're facing today.

289
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,333
That is why network
security is very

290
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,133
expensive, very difficult
to manage, very slow

291
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,700
because of the
computing power.

292
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,399
So, that is why we do
believe you do need to

293
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:46,200
have a how to deal with
like a GPI, AI in the AI

294
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,366
space and the TPU.

295
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:51,000
All of this is - you need
to have some acceleration

296
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,233
beyond a
general-purpose CPU.

297
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:55,500
So, you need to have a
dedicated tower, dedicated

298
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:58,700
ASIC chip to boost
your computing power,

299
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,533
to close the gap.

300
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,799
Otherwise, you can see the
gap will get bigger and

301
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:06,033
bigger because the network
will get faster and faster

302
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,933
and the network security
will get much slower to

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,299
deal with all of
this bad traffic.

304
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,699
Luckily, we have SD-WAN.

305
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,665
You can study and read
all of the traffic-based

306
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,032
applications in the hope
of being able to read

307
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,100
traffic based
on the content.

308
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,833
That can solve some of the
problem when you combine

309
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,266
network security together,
but the computing gap

310
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,433
is still there.

311
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,666
We still have
a huge issue.

312
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:33,899
So, that's where you can
see, there are others and

313
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,766
it's really the
consolidation we keep

314
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,033
talking about.

315
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,000
A lot of IT people say
hey, I have too many

316
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,466
products to manage.

317
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,066
What is the best way to
reduce the management cost

318
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,100
and how we can consolidate
a lot of things together?

319
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,899
It is happening in the
network security industry.

320
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:54,899
So, ten, twelve years ago,
so the top four vendors in

321
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:58,799
network security counted
for less than 40% of the

322
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:01,600
total space, both on
unit shipments and also

323
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,966
on the revenue.

324
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,799
So, today, you can see the
top four vendors count for

325
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,000
more than 60% of
the total market.

326
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,633
The odds are keeping
reduced and are probably

327
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,766
only about 30% today.

328
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
So, the consolidations
do happen in the network

329
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,066
security space.

330
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,266
And also, in the whole
cybersecurity space,

331
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,632
it is similar.

332
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,766
So, you can look in the
whole industry, maybe over

333
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,266
a hundred billion.

334
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,533
So, what kind of platform,
what kind of company can

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,133
help to consolidate?

336
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,233
So, ten, twenty years ago,
the endpoint company,

337
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,199
Symantec, McAfee,
I think they try.

338
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:42,266
It works a little bit but
not quite to consolidate a lot.

339
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,966
So, now the network
security companies become

340
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,399
the bigger sector for the
whole cybersecurity space.

341
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:54,133
We also try to see how
we can help integrate,

342
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,600
consolidate, making
managing the whole of

343
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,766
security easy.

344
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,399
That is why we try
to address the whole

345
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,733
infrastructure
security now.

346
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,866
And so, what kind of
company will be better

347
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,000
positioned to do that?

348
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,933
You need to integrate.

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
So, that's the first step.

350
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,266
And also, you
need to automate.

351
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,966
So, automation is the
target, is the final goal

352
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,699
we try to achieve.

353
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,966
Without automation, you
cannot deal with all of

354
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,598
this attacking from all
different sectors there,

355
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,933
but automation will
come from integration.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,766
So, without integration,
automation will not work.

357
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,066
So, that is where we do
believe network security

358
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:37,400
has the best position to
see a lot of data, a lot

359
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,299
of traffic, to deal with
endpoint or deal with all

360
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:44,000
of this different data in
the Cloud and edge and

361
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,400
eventually helping toward
the integration to automation.

362
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,033
So, we are luckily in a
very good position to help

363
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,099
the industry lower
the management cost.

364
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,332
So, those were the three
points I tried to share

365
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,866
with you, I tried
to talk about.

366
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:06,666
Like first, so the
traditional network

367
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:11,299
security needs to go beyond the perimeter-based security.

368
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:15,066
So, they need to go
to the wide area side.

369
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:19,766
Go to SD-WAN, go to 5G,
go to whatever, SDN, and

370
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,900
expand from there.

371
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,433
That is all of the IoT
and all of the others

372
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
going on there.

373
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:28,533
And they also need to go
internally to the internal

374
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,200
segmentation, replacing
some of the switch and at

375
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:35,500
the same time, deal with
Wi-Fi security, deal with

376
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,000
a lot of other devices
inside the company.

377
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,933
So, that's where the
network security needs to

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,133
be addressed, the
whole infrastructure.

379
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,233
So, not just the
perimeter anymore.

380
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,966
We need to go to the WAN
side and we need to go to

381
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,899
the LAN side.

382
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:52,366
The second takeaway is
really edge and Cloud;

383
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:54,700
both are very important.

384
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,066
I think Cloud in a
security angle, they maybe

385
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,599
deal with certain
functions better, like

386
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,233
management, like
detection, but if you want

387
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:05,466
to do the prevention, if
you want to do the real

388
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:11,000
time, like all of the low
latency traffic, you have

389
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,633
to address the
edge security.

390
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,833
So, that is where you need
to have both the edge and

391
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,200
Cloud security.

392
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:20,633
And Gartner said edge will
eat the Cloud in a few years.

393
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,433
So, edge does have all the
data and they also have a

394
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,366
lot of functionality to
perform in real time.

395
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,166
And then the third is
about the whole industry.

396
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,599
Right?

397
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,033
So, in the security
space, it is pretty good.

398
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,666
All this old function
never goes away and then

399
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,799
there is a new function,
there is a new application

400
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,133
that keeps being
added every year.

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,833
There is a many point
solution to address some

402
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,400
parts of security, but in
the end when the customers

403
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,500
started using the device,
they had to deal with so

404
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,299
many different products.

405
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:57,200
So, how to do better
integration, how to do

406
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,333
better automation.

407
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,966
That is facing the
whole industry now.

408
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,666
I do believe now it is
the turn for the network

409
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:08,233
security vendor to see
what we can do to reduce

410
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,966
all this management cost.

411
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:14,733
So, thank you all, and
very lucky we are all

412
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,633
working together to try
to solve the problem.

413
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,133
Thank you very much.
