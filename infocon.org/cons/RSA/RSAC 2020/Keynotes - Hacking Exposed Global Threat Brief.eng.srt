1
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:09,433
>> SPEAKER: Please
welcome Dmitri Alperovitch.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,899
>> DMITRI ALPEROVITCH:
Good morning, RSA.

3
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:21,133
Great to be with you.

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,399
Thank you so much for making it.

5
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:25,699
I imagine a lot of you had a
late night last night, went

6
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,465
around the various parties that
are out here, but I really

7
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,766
appreciate you coming.

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,132
My name is Dmitri Alperovitch.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,700
And I really, when I was
thinking about opening up this

10
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,766
keynote, I really wanted to do a
joke at the expense of a certain

11
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,132
Richard Cranian, but I'm
afraid I don't know any.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
If you don't get that, you can
come talk to me after the talk.

13
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,166
First of all, I want to address
the elephant in the room, and

14
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,299
I'm not talking
about a new adversary.

15
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,966
A few of you may have seen my
announcement last week that I

16
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:59,466
have left CrowdStrike, a company
that I co-founded almost nine

17
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,399
years ago now, and I wanted to
take a moment to explain the

18
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,366
reasoning for that and
share with you my thoughts on

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,266
the future.

20
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,533
So, a few of you that know me
may know that when I was working

21
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,000
on my college degree first
in computer science and then

22
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:19,633
graduate degree in cybersecurity
or information security as it

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,766
was called back 20 years ago,
I also had a passion and took a

24
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,733
lot of classes in
international affairs.

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,266
And then when I went into
industry after college, I always

26
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,133
assumed that I would never use
that part of my brain again in

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
my professional life, and that I
would be spending it in the tech

28
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,866
sector working on some of these
challenging problems that we

29
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,066
have in this field.

30
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,798
And for the first ten years
of my career, that was pretty

31
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,133
much true.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,466
Yet in 2010, something happened.

33
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,266
An attack called Operation
Aurora, which I ended up working

34
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:56,366
on and ended up naming,
and that attack really

35
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,633
changed everything.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,299
It brought to the fore in
our industry, of course, this

37
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,266
term APT.

38
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,099
It got everyone to recognize
that nation states were a

39
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,599
huge problem.

40
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,532
And more importantly, it
got noticed by politicians

41
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,933
in Washington.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,866
National security types that
have never really cared much

43
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:19,266
about these issues realized
suddenly that, in this realm,

44
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,900
we work on geopolitics, that
geopolitics is driving a lot of

45
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,533
the challenges that we are
seeing now in this field.

46
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,233
Ever since then, that, of
course, has been amplified and

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,033
amplified, even in recent years
as you have seen from the news.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,033
So as I started thinking about
this and shortly after Operation

49
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,965
Aurora, I ended up starting
CrowdStrike to work on the

50
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,899
technical and intelligence part
of this problem to try to solve

51
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,500
it from that angle.

52
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,966
Obviously, we have had great
success, and I'm really grateful

53
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,899
for the run that I've had there.

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,400
But as I'm looking at the next
phase of my career, I really

55
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,966
wanted to focus on the other
side of the problem, which is

56
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,232
the policy side,
which is becoming more and

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
more important.

58
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,900
I'm going to be launching a
policy accelerator, a nonprofit

59
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:10,433
that I'm starting to work
on these issues, identify

60
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,033
solutions, and try to get them
in front of policymakers to try

61
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,799
to get to legislative and
executive branch decisions on

62
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,133
these really critical issues.

63
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,300
I hope a lot of you will
help me on this journey.

64
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:25,833
I'm in need of ideas, and this
is one of the ways that I want

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,966
to give back to the community.

66
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:30,000
But specifically, more relevant
to this talk, this talk is going

67
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,900
to be a little bit different
from prior talks that I have

68
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,599
given on this stage over the
years because it will be less of

69
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,666
a highlight of specific hacking
techniques, but more of a

70
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:43,099
broad-level threat review of
what we have seen and some of my

71
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,133
thoughts on
strategy going forward.

72
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,133
With the recent announcement,
what you are getting is really

73
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,566
the unvarnished Dmitri.

74
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:52,266
For the first time in over 15
years that I've been on this

75
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
stage speaking,
I am not representing a

76
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,266
commercial company.

77
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:01,400
For better or for worse, I am
unencumbered by that and you're

78
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,099
getting the straight
talk directly from me.

79
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,533
So, with that,
let's jump in, 2019.

80
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,698
The other thing that's been
happening over the last ten

81
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,233
years as I've been coming to
this conference talking about

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,033
the things that we've been
seeing from the different threat

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,366
actors, almost exclusively it
has been about nation states.

84
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:26,199
Really, since Aurora and since
China came to the fore with

85
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,466
their hacks into these
technology companies, including

86
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,433
Google, people have been
thinking through what are nation

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,266
states doing, not just China,
but later Russia and Iran and

88
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,100
North Korea and a whole
slew of different actors.

89
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,633
But 2019 was really, really
different because the major

90
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,566
story was actually not nation
states; it was ransomware.

91
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:50,366
And so many organizations that I
have talked to over the years,

92
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:53,699
specifically in the last year,
have been experiencing

93
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:54,500
this issue.

94
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:56,433
There are a couple of
drivers behind that.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,366
One has been really the
invention of cryptocurrency.

96
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,832
Ransomware is not
a new phenomenon.

97
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,466
In fact, some of the earliest
versions of ransomware appeared

98
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,866
in the late '80s, early '90s.

99
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,033
But at the time when it would
encrypt your data, it would

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,866
literally pop up a message on
your system, in the DOS days

101
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,433
back then, saying here is the
wire instructions for you to

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,766
wire the money to
the bank account.

103
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,833
As you can imagine, not very
hard for law enforcement to

104
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,266
trace back to the ownership of
that bank account and try to

105
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,966
find the perpetrators.

106
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,766
So ransomware did not really
pick up until the invention of

107
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,399
bitcoin and some of these
alternative cryptocurrencies,

108
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,066
and then it slowly
started to take off.

109
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,366
But 2019 really was
the year of ransomware.

110
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,733
The problem with ransomware
these days is that they're

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,199
adopting the techniques of
nation states, living off the

112
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:47,066
land, also leveraging what some
in the industry call big game

113
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:50,332
hunting, the idea that
you're going to infiltrate an

114
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,366
organization, move laterally,
get administrative credentials,

115
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:58,066
have as much access as possible,
and then all at once deploy your

116
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:04,733
crypto malware in that
organization and really try to

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,399
have as much
operational impact as possible.

118
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,399
We've been seeing that a lot,
and I'll talk more about some of

119
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,399
the groups that we've been
seeing and some of the latest

120
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,466
trends in that realm.

121
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,233
But the other trend really is
that China and Russia, sort of

122
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,666
the actors that we talk about
often at these conferences, have

123
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,233
taken a backseat to some of the
other nation states that are

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,633
becoming more and more prevalent
in this arena, and some of them,

125
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,466
new actors that perhaps you
haven't paid much attention to

126
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,533
in the past.

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,100
And, you know, for 20 or 30
years now, I have been hearing

128
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,266
politicians and other experts
talk about how we would see this

129
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,100
proliferation of threat actors,
how so many countries out there

130
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,600
are building military
capabilities in this domain, how

131
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,500
they're buying cyber tools from
others or building their own.

132
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:53,765
But for the most part, that
hasn't been relevant to you in

133
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,633
this industry because those
actors, while out there, have

134
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,333
mostly focused on traditional
national security targets.

135
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,133
It has been sort of government
on government diplomatic spying,

136
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,699
counterterrorism operations.

137
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,966
In the case of some regimes,
if you're a journalist or an

138
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:15,466
activist or a dissident, you may
have been a victim of some of

139
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,399
those operations.

140
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,433
But by and large, the vast
population out there, and

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,300
certainly in the commercial
sector, really didn't have to

142
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,800
care about those actors.

143
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:23,866
That is starting to change.

144
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,699
In addition to north Korea and
Iran, we are starting to see

145
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:30,899
other countries get into the
game of doing cyber-operations

146
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,233
against the commercial sector.

147
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,600
Vietnam and Pakistan are the
more notable ones as they are

148
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,100
increasing their op tempo
and really getting into this

149
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,600
intellectual
property theft game.

150
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll talk more about that.

151
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:48,433
Russia, surprisingly,
stayed pretty low-key in 2019.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,899
Very few operations were
observed, mostly in their own

153
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:56,100
sort of regional sphere, and
that may not necessarily

154
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,166
continue to the future.

155
00:07:57,233 --> 00:08:00,300
But for the time being, they
were not the dominant story in

156
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:02,265
the cyber domain.

157
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,100
However, on the China front, we
continued to see intellectual

158
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,966
property theft unabated.

159
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:13,666
There was a brief period of sort
of quietness after the Obama-Shi

160
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,466
agreement that was struck in
2015 where China committed to

161
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:20,966
not engaging in economic
espionage through cyber means.

162
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,533
That agreement lasted for about
a year, year and a half, and

163
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,266
then they started
resuming their activity.

164
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,000
But one of the things that has
dramatically changed in the last

165
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:33,533
few years is that the military,
the PLA that was responsible for

166
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,832
the vast amount of operations
that we had been seeing from

167
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,765
China really has disappeared,
and now most of the operations

168
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,132
are being conducted by the
Ministry of State Security.

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,733
It's sort of a hybrid of CIA and
FBI is a good way to think about

170
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,132
that in terms of the authorities
within China, and they heavily

171
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,333
leverage contractors and some of
them have been indicted by the

172
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,166
justice department.

173
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,533
So let's dig into
some of these phenomena.

174
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,666
On ransomware in particular,
what's been really amazing to

175
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,233
watch is the rapid evolution
in ransomware attacks.

176
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,733
So Ryuk, one of the more popular
ransomware families out there

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,233
that are continuously hitting
all types of small businesses,

178
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,699
school districts, even larger
companies has only been around

179
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,966
for about 18 months.

180
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:26,933
The GandCrab malware, very, very
popular, very, very successful,

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,899
was shut down last May and a new
variant, REvil, has appeared a

182
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,233
short few months later.

183
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,132
We are seeing a lot of
iterations that have taken place

184
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,033
and a lot of capabilities
are being developed.

185
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,700
One of the recent capabilities
that was developed for Ryuk, for

186
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:48,000
example, is the ability for it
to spread even for devices that

187
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,299
are sleeping and using the
wake-on-LAN feature to wake them

188
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:56,633
up, mount their shares via SMB
protocol, and then encrypt all

189
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,100
the files on those devices,
allowing them, of course, to

190
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,533
have much more impact and
spread much more widely within

191
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,733
their organizations.

192
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,899
Typically, those ransomware
attacks are being delivered

193
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:09,333
through other Trojans that may
arrive in spam emails, like

194
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,766
Emotet and TrickBot, and most
of them are operated by Russian

195
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,333
cybercriminal groups these days.

196
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,199
Ransom payments are
going up as well, but you can

197
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,599
negotiate them.

198
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,866
If you do fall victim, and if
you end up being forced to pay

199
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,766
ransom, know that you don't
have to pay the sticker price.

200
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,233
It's a little bit
like the used car lot.

201
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,199
They are receptive to
negotiations, and I have seen

202
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,733
companies that have been very
successful at dramatically

203
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,566
lowering the initial price
that is being requested.

204
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,766
But paying ransom may not
always solve your problems.

205
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,132
It's not just that thieves have
no honor and they may actually

206
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,733
not give you the decryption
programs after you pay them,

207
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,333
although, in most cases,
particularly in these well-known

208
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,100
ransomware operations, they do,
in fact, give you the programs.

209
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,333
I know of a case recently, I was
talking to this company that

210
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,033
said that they actually paid
ransom, it was for a Ryuk

211
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,333
infection, and they got the
decryption program, but the

212
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,866
decryption program was buggy,
not malicious but just buggy,

213
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,566
and it ended up taking down
their infrastructure even

214
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,566
further as a result of
them executing this.

215
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,766
As you can imagine, these
criminals don't necessarily have

216
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,100
sophisticated testing
infrastructures.

217
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,799
To the extent that they test
anything, it is going to be

218
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:30,366
their original malware so that
they can be used on as many

219
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,566
systems as possible, and the
decryption program may very well

220
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,500
be an afterthought.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,700
The good news here, though,
is that those operations are

222
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:39,766
not instant.

223
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,733
You have time to respond.

224
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,199
In many of these cases, the time
from the initial intrusion by

225
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,199
one of these adversaries into
your network to the time when

226
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:51,699
they can actually deploy the
ransom program across your

227
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:54,333
environment is measured in days.

228
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,200
So don't think that just because
you got an Emotet infection that

229
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,299
immediately you're going to
have your network be encrypted.

230
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,100
They tend to lie low.

231
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,899
They tend to do reconnaissance
in the environment, elevate

232
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:10,899
privileges, get as much access
to the network as possible so

233
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,366
that they can have that
maximum effect when they deploy

234
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,100
their malware.

235
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:18,099
The other thing that I often
hear from companies is they tell

236
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,000
me we have backups,
so we're good.

237
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,933
Even in the worst-case scenario,
we didn't stop something,

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,799
we can restore.

239
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,165
I was talking to this one
company that ended up paying the

240
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,699
ransom as well, and I asked
them, did you have backups, and

241
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:31,699
they said, well, yes, we did.

242
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,933
Were they encrypted?

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,833
No. They're stored off-site.

244
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,899
We're good.

245
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,100
I was confused.

246
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,333
Why would you pay a ransom?

247
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,833
They told me it would take too
long to restore from backups,

248
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,733
and it would cause them a
greater operational impact than

249
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,033
paying the ransom of a few
hundred thousand dollars.

250
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,799
Make sure that you practice your
disaster recovery techniques.

251
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,566
Just because you have it doesn't
mean that you can restore

252
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,733
quickly, and you may be forced
into a decision of having to pay

253
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,399
a criminal to restore your data
even though you have access

254
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,100
to it.

255
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,066
Let's talk about some of
the other nation states that

256
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,100
I mentioned.

257
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,000
Pakistan is one that has
probably not been much on your

258
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:15,333
radar lately, and there
are good reasons for that.

259
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,500
This is an actor that has been
around for a number of years,

260
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,433
various companies call it by
different names, APT 36, Mythic

261
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,433
Leopard, Operation Transparent
Tribe, and on and on and on.

262
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,666
And traditionally they have
been targeting India, so unless

263
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,000
you're an Indian company, unless
you're an Indian government, it

264
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,500
really wasn't a threat actor
that you were paying much

265
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,166
attention to.

266
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:36,899
But lately that's been changing.

267
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,766
They have been expanding more
and more into targeting other

268
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:45,165
governments, NATO, some of the
UN organizations, but recently

269
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,965
also western industry.

270
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:50,000
There's been great reporting
on that from a number of firms

271
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:53,633
looking at this issue because
Pakistan is now realizing that

272
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,566
the Chinese model, the model
that they invented 20 years ago,

273
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,566
that you can leverage cyber to
effectively steal intellectual

274
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:04,100
property for the benefit of
your own domestic industry is

275
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,766
something that can be applied
by many, many other countries.

276
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,966
That's one of the trends that
you will see throughout this

277
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,799
presentation is how more and
more nation states are getting

278
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,500
into this IP theft game.

279
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:17,600
Unfortunately, we didn't
stop China early enough.

280
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,000
The government really did not
pay much attention to this until

281
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:24,933
relatively recently and we're
now paying the price, not just

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,799
in terms of all the intellectual
property that have been stolen

283
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,933
by the Chinese government from
western networks, but now also,

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,133
of course, other countries
jumping into this space.

285
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,733
And, really, we've established a
de facto norm where we have told

286
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,132
the world that we will tolerate
this activity, that stealing

287
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,933
intellectual property from the
commercial sector, giving it to

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,333
your own companies is okay,
and we have got to get back

289
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,799
to deterrents.

290
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,899
And that's another thing that I
think the policymakers really

291
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,933
need to think
through these days.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,833
By the way, the Pakistan
capabilities are growing in

293
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,399
sophistication.

294
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,966
They started out with pretty
simple dot net type of remote

295
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:06,833
access tools, and over time, as
you can expect with any of these

296
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,500
threat actors, they have gotten
better and better over time.

297
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,533
Vietnam also is taking note.

298
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,166
This is, again, an actor that
has been around for a number

299
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,399
of years.

300
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,866
OceanLotus was one of its
original names; Ocean Buffalo,

301
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:28,266
APT32, and other names that
various industry groups call it.

302
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,866
Initially, it was
really focused on China.

303
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,033
As you can imagine, Vietnam is
very close to its big neighbor,

304
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,333
so some of the initial reporting
threat actor actually came from

305
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,299
Chinese security firms.

306
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:45,333
However, over time, it expanded
to other regional targets,

307
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,166
Cambodia and actually targets
inside Vietnam that may have

308
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:52,799
been targeted for law
enforcement operations by the

309
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,433
Vietnamese government.

310
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,000
But now we're seeing more and
more activity from them in the

311
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,333
IP theft space.

312
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:05,433
The big foray into that came in
really 2017-2018 when industry

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,033
started seeing them in
the automotive sector.

314
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,600
A number of huge automotive
companies, some with presence in

315
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:16,100
Vietnam started getting hit by
these Vietnamese operations.

316
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,766
Intellectual
property was stolen.

317
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,033
This was not their
first foray into IP theft.

318
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,399
In fact, Fire Eye published a
great report on this a few years

319
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,366
ago where they documented some
of the early operations going

320
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:30,665
back a number of years, but they
were limited in scope and mostly

321
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,333
focused on regional targets.

322
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,666
This was one of the big ones
that targeted western firms and

323
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,532
they really weren't paying
attention to the threat actor.

324
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,333
In 2019, they started to expand
into other sectors as well.

325
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,700
Iran.

326
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:47,733
Lots of different actors
operating out of Iran, some tied

327
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,699
to the IRGC, some tied to their
ministry of intelligence, MOIS.

328
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:55,165
They have different priorities.

329
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:59,433
Some of these groups target
dissidents, people inside Iran,

330
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,399
those that help them on the
outside, some of them go after

331
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,533
intellectual property.

332
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,033
There was a great indictment by
the Justice Department about a

333
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:12,332
year ago of this institute in
Tehran that was responsible for

334
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,633
operations against universities
and private sector firms where

335
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,966
the Iranians were breaking
in and stealing intellectual

336
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:21,366
property from those
organizations to leverage for

337
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,032
their own domestic industries
in sectors that are strategic

338
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:25,299
for Iran.

339
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:29,066
However, there is also
potentially a military component

340
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,299
to these operations as well.

341
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:35,500
One of the actors, Charming
Kitten, APT35, Parastoo, called

342
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:38,500
by different names, Iran-based
adversary that is traditionally

343
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:41,266
focused on strategic
intelligence collection both in

344
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,599
the U.S. and against Middle Eastern targets like the Saudis

345
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:48,000
and others that the
Iranians may be interested in.

346
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:52,633
You saw a bunch of really
disturbing kinetic operations

347
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,099
recently from Iran where they
targeted the Saudi oil facility,

348
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,765
of course, with a drone attack,
and prior to that, targeted

349
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,033
international shipping with
limpet mines that were attached

350
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,765
to those shipping operations.

351
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
It is quite possible and there
is a lot of research that is

352
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,166
being done into this right now
of whether operations, cyber

353
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:15,133
operations perhaps by those
actors to do reconnaissance

354
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,799
before those military
operations took place.

355
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,066
You have to figure out where
those ships are, you have to do

356
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,099
reconnaissance against
those oil facilities.

357
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,700
More research to be done there,
but increasingly we are starting

358
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:28,099
to see this combination of using
cyber for reconnaissance for

359
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,033
traditional kinetic operations
that are taking place.

360
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:37,266
North Koreans, they have really
gotten into high gear lately,

361
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,566
particularly in 2019.

362
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:42,700
On this particular threat
actor, I have to say the media

363
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,666
reporting has been
particularly bad.

364
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,599
There's been a lot of confusion
and talk of this Lazarus group

365
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:53,000
which really is an amalgamation
of many different groups that

366
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,333
are inside North Korea.

367
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
In North Korea, one of the
primary actors is their

368
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,599
Reconnaissance General Bureau,
one of their intelligence

369
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,233
agencies, military intelligence
agencies, but there are others

370
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,366
as well.

371
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:07,000
Within that organization, there
are probably different offices

372
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,933
with different priorities
focused on cyber operations.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,666
It's important not to lump
everything into one group and

374
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,000
start thinking through the
different actors that are

375
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,000
maybe involved.

376
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,099
Here are the few that are
particularly active these days.

377
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,933
Velvet Chollima or Kimsuki
traditionally has focused on

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,066
breaking into think tanks,
particularly think tanks that

379
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,500
are publishing reports on
North Korea universities.

380
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:32,599
They are doing research,
western universities,

381
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,832
on North Korean policies.

382
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,599
And as with anything in North
Korea, you have to also make

383
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,765
money on the side.

384
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:44,166
It's a very interesting regime,
unlike any other, in that when

385
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:48,000
you are a government agency and
you are given certain priorities

386
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,166
from the top, obviously
centrally planned economy, on

387
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,765
what you're going to execute
in the case of military

388
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,166
intelligence, what operations
you may need to do in the

389
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,966
following year, you're not
necessarily given the full

390
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,565
funding to execute those
operations and you're expected

391
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,200
to make up for that
shortfall somehow.

392
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:11,133
And as it is often in North
Korea, a lot of entrepreneurial

393
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,166
folks that are inside those
organizations realize that it

394
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:18,832
would be very bad for their
health and would have a very

395
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,333
limiting impact on their life to
disobey those orders and not to

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,433
execute them, even if you don't
have the funding, so you have to

397
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,466
find it elsewhere.

398
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,166
That is why, over the years,
you have seen so many illicit

399
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,666
operations originating from
North Korea, whether it be

400
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,265
currency counterfeiting, drug
trafficking, and, of course,

401
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,466
lately cyber.

402
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:41,565
Even with this group, Kimsuki or
Velvet Chollima, a group that's

403
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,466
focused on traditional
intelligence collection for the

404
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,533
purpose of informing the regime
about how the world is seeing it

405
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,899
and what different governments
and people outside of government

406
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,399
are thinking about them, even
when they're breaking in and

407
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,866
doing these strategic
operations, they can't help

408
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:00,700
themselves but not install
cryptocurrency miners to make

409
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:04,533
some money on the side to
compensate for those shortfalls.

410
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,700
This group, by the way, has
grown in sophistication.

411
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,933
Increasingly, they are
figuring out how to target

412
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,166
non-traditional data sources,
getting browser plugins, like

413
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:18,500
malicious Chrome plugins that we
have seen over the years being

414
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,599
developed by this group,
stealing passwords from browsers

415
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,700
like Chrome as well, using web
vulnerability scanners once

416
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,766
you're inside the network to
identify vulnerabilities that

417
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,099
they can use for further
proliferation, and leveraging

418
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,633
both native tools like NavRat, a
great Cisco Talos report on this

419
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,500
particular piece of malware that
came out recently, but also

420
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:43,200
open-source tools like
Kusarat that is openly available

421
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,266
on GitHub.

422
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,000
That is another trend that we're
seeing from a lot of threat

423
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,633
actors, both sophisticated
and less so, where they're

424
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,133
increasingly using these
open-source tools or tools that

425
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,166
are commercially available
to execute their operations.

426
00:21:57,266 --> 00:22:01,799
Stardust Chollima or APT38 is
another group that is operating

427
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:05,133
out of North Korea, and they are
focused almost exclusively on

428
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
financial targets.

429
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,966
Those are the groups that
you've seen being part of the

430
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:11,699
Bangladesh bank heist that was
in the news a number of years

431
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:15,033
ago, the swift compromises, and
on and on and on, and they are

432
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,066
still around.

433
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,566
You may not have heard of more
impressive operations like

434
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:23,266
Bangladesh or the Bank of Chile
recently, but they are still

435
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:28,033
targeting smaller organizations
in order to extract money.

436
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,866
They have not disappeared,
despite the warming of relations

437
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,566
recently, or until recently I
should say, between the United

438
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,633
States and the DPRK.

439
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,033
One of the TTPs that you should
watch for is the use of RDP

440
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,366
where they get in either with
brute force credentials or

441
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:49,799
credentials that they have
stolen from prior operations or

442
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:53,400
guessed those credentials with
kind of credential stuffing

443
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:57,599
techniques, find an account, an
external service that they can

444
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:01,599
RDP into, use those mechanisms
also for lateral movement.

445
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,533
It's something to watch
and something to consider

446
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,566
implementing two-factor on
your external RDP systems.

447
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,866
Labyrinth Chollima is another
interesting actor where, again,

448
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:12,933
North Koreans.

449
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Even the North Koreans are
getting into the IP theft game.

450
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,733
You may think that the North
Korean economy is not producing

451
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,666
much of anything, but, actually,
over the last ten years there

452
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,599
has been a focus on developing
some limited private markets and

453
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,899
enabling some level of
enterprise, even though it's

454
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:31,799
still very much controlled and
overseen by the government.

455
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:34,099
And as they have been trying to
open up their economy and trying

456
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,433
to escape sanctions, again,
watching what the Chinese have

457
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,099
done, watching what the other
nation states are starting to

458
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,666
do, jumping into this IP theft
game is something that we are

459
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,733
increasingly starting to
see from the North Koreans.

460
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,466
Perhaps the most interesting
thing in this entire deck is

461
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,533
really China.

462
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:59,133
And this is where I'm going to
say something controversial, and

463
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,033
I encourage folks to come
find me afterwards and try to

464
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:04,566
convince me that
this is not the case.

465
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:07,266
But from everything I have seen
and talked to lots of folks in

466
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:14,466
the industry, the Chinese really
seem to be impacted by the U.S.

467
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,000
Justice Department actions, the
indictments that we have seen in

468
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,500
a way that I have not seen from
any other actor, not from the

469
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:22,966
Iranians, not from the Russians,
not from the North Koreans who

470
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,799
have all been indicted for the
various cyber operations over

471
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,433
the years.

472
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,900
Specifically, with the Chinese,
we have seen a number of

473
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:36,533
indictments, the first one
you have seen when the U.S.

474
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,566
Justice Department indicted
PLA officers that were part of

475
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,633
unit 61398.

476
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,666
Ever since that indictment, that
PLA unit has basically vanished

477
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:51,700
from everything that I have
seen from industry sources.

478
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:54,766
That has been really,
really remarkable.

479
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,299
It's possible that
they have retooled.

480
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:59,400
It's possible that they've been
sort of sent to other units.

481
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,466
It's possible that they've
experienced some sort of

482
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,666
punishment for getting caught.

483
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:07,366
But really interesting tidbit.

484
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,333
But then, we have seen some of
the more recent indictments of

485
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,966
MSS contractors.

486
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:15,533
This group called Boyusec that
was known as APT3 or Gothic

487
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,765
Panda, back in November of 2017.

488
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,500
In December of 2018,
another indictment of APT10 or

489
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,599
Stone Panda.

490
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,299
This is a group that has been
going after the managed service

491
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:28,966
providers that you may have
heard about in recent years.

492
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:32,765
Both of these groups, from what
I have seen and talked to others

493
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:37,366
in the industry, have pretty
much disappeared shortly after

494
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,599
those indictments.

495
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,500
Really, really interesting.

496
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:43,599
Again, when we see the Russians
being indicted and we see the

497
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,933
North Koreans get indicted, they
pretty much ignore that, they

498
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,033
move on.

499
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,899
In this particular case, when it
comes to those specific units,

500
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:55,565
they seem to have been impacted,
or at a minimum retooled and

501
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:58,799
re-emerged as new groups, which,
in a way, is still a success

502
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,666
because you're making
life a lot harder for them.

503
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:04,033
By all means, the Chinese
have not disappeared.

504
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:08,733
There are many other groups
associated with MSS that are

505
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,866
still executing high tempo of
operations and now increasingly

506
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,233
using insiders.

507
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:17,466
One of the indictments from last
year that was really interesting

508
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:23,332
to watch from the Justice
Department is how they described

509
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,766
the operations from MSS to
recruit sometimes Chinese

510
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,733
nationals but often westerners
inside those companies to work

511
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,566
for them to give them
information, sometimes to enable

512
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,533
cyber operations.

513
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,899
In one case in particular
described in the indictment,

514
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:38,899
they asked the person to plug
in a USB drive into a computer

515
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:42,899
loaded with malware so that they
could get remote access enabled

516
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:47,666
with a physical
insider to that network.

517
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,265
So, increasingly, we'll probably
start to see more and more of

518
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,733
these operations going forward.

519
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,433
But probably one of the most
interesting cases about China is

520
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,400
what happened to the PLA.

521
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:02,099
I mentioned the Obama-Shi
agreement that was struck in

522
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:05,866
2015 and the lull in activity
from China, from all threat

523
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:10,200
actors in China for a
period of time afterwards.

524
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:13,066
And when they re-emerged,
virtually everything that we in

525
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:17,400
the industry were seeing was MSS
affiliated groups, not the PLA.

526
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:22,000
And I have always been wondering
what happened to the PLA?

527
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:26,366
It also happened to coincide
with a major restructuring where

528
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:29,333
the old third department of
the general staff that was

529
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,000
responsible for the cyber
mission within the PLA was

530
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:37,099
restructured and to the new
strategic support force that was

531
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:42,099
created, a lot of the old guard
was kicked out of the PLA with

532
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,466
the anti-corruption
campaign that President Shi

533
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,632
had initiated.

534
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,033
There was a lot of turmoil
that was happening internally.

535
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:57,933
But even to this day, most firms
that I've talked to out there -

536
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,900
I just had recently a
conversation with FireEye - are

537
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:05,733
not seeing PLA activity
across all the intrusions that

538
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,766
we're tracking.

539
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That is why the indictment
for the Equifax breach was so

540
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:14,433
interesting where, for the first
time, really, since 2015, the

541
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,799
Justice Department has pointed
a finger at the PLA and those

542
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:23,099
three operatives that you see on
the slide for being responsible

543
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,765
for the Equifax breach.

544
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:28,366
It will be really interesting
to watch what happens.

545
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,066
Is this a standalone operation?

546
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,066
Is this part of something bigger
where we'll see more and more

547
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,833
PLA officers coming to the fore?

548
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,966
In this particular case, it was
a new unit, 54th institute of

549
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,799
the PLA that was responsible for
this hack, not affiliated with

550
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:47,599
the old structure of the third
department of general staff.

551
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,000
We will see what
else they may be doing.

552
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:53,299
It may be that their mission has
been restructured towards more

553
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:56,966
military on military
confrontations and MSS has been

554
00:28:57,033 --> 00:29:01,265
the primary beneficiary of
the mission of collecting

555
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,766
intellectual property and
conducting economic espionage.

556
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,033
And then Russia.

557
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:10,633
As I mentioned, very
low-key year for Russia.

558
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,000
Very limited
tempo of operations.

559
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:19,066
The two primary actors seen
in 2019 were Fancy Bear and

560
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:23,500
Venomous Bear, APT28 or Turla or
Snake, as they are often called.

561
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,766
Both of them have been focused
on doing very limited operations

562
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:32,066
in Russian sphere of influence
where they are primarily

563
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:34,966
involved in, such as Ukraine,
such as Middle East.

564
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:37,299
Obviously, they have got a
huge presence from a military

565
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:42,366
standpoint in Syria and a lot of
strategic interest in that area.

566
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:43,566
We will see what happens.

567
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:50,133
We will see perhaps resumption
of activity in the United States

568
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,233
going forward.

569
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,000
That remains to be seen.

570
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,533
So where are we going next?

571
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,633
A couple of predictions.

572
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,933
I will pull out my crystal ball
and look at what's happening.

573
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,033
Right at the end of last year,
I was doing predictions for the

574
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:10,166
RSA Advisory Board of which I'm
a member, and I put forward this

575
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:13,332
prediction that we are going
to see some major disruptive

576
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,466
attacks from Iran in 2020
against western targets.

577
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:22,000
We have seen, obviously, a wave
of wiper attacks from Iran going

578
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:25,633
back to 2012 and their original
hack into IRAMCO using the

579
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,966
Shamoon malware.

580
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:31,565
Many waves of Shamoon ever since
in Saudi and some other parts of

581
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,933
the region.

582
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,366
But since really the denial
of service attachs and the

583
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:40,366
operation against the Sands
Casino that Sheldon Adelson

584
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:46,233
runs, we have not seen major
disruptive attacks from Iran

585
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,466
against western institutions.

586
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,500
We have seen intrusions.

587
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:52,233
We have seen theft of IP
and collection of strategic

588
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:56,099
intelligence, but we have not
seen the types of destructive

589
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,700
malware that they're
deploying in the region.

590
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:02,099
I thought with the escalation
of activities between the U.S.

591
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:05,899
and Iran, that was
increasingly becoming likely.

592
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:09,699
Little did I know that four or
five days into the new year, my

593
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:13,266
prediction may come true
early with the killing of

594
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,799
Qasem Soleimani.

595
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:17,966
We have not yet, of course,
seen Iran's retaliation.

596
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:22,000
But given its past history
of how they retaliate both

597
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:26,233
kinetically and in cyber, they
tend to bide their time, they

598
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:30,666
tend to wait out for the
perfect moment to strike, so my

599
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,966
prediction still
holds for the year.

600
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:36,699
Unfortunately, I think we are
likely to see operations in the

601
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:39,733
west from Iran that
could be very disruptive.

602
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,966
Russia.

603
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:46,199
I do not expect them to stay
low key for the remainder of

604
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,299
this year.

605
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,299
Obviously, elections are coming
up, not just in this country,

606
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,666
but in Poland and Spain and
other places that they may have

607
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,433
strategic interest in.

608
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,799
Beyond elections, I think we may
see a resumption of intellectual

609
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,099
property theft from Russia.

610
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:04,599
There was a huge spike of
activity early on after the

611
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:10,566
takeover of Crimea in 2014 where
you had SVR and other parts of

612
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,299
the Russian intelligence
services breaking into

613
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,233
companies, stealing IP for
sectors that were under

614
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:22,066
sanctions, and couldn't
necessarily develop that IP

615
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,833
indigenously or in
partnership with western firms.

616
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,166
And as a result, the Russians
resorted to that tried and true

617
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:32,399
tactic that the Chinese
have pioneered of stealing

618
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,366
intellectual property.

619
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,033
We may very well see a
resumption of that this year.

620
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:43,399
China, despite the trade deal
that was struck just about a

621
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:47,299
month ago, I do not see
the Chinese stopping their

622
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,633
activities in the
economic espionage realm.

623
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,466
I do believe that the -
unfortunately, the coronavirus

624
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,132
is going to have a huge
impact on their economy.

625
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,333
Eighty percent of the Chinese
economy is effectively shut down

626
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,633
at the moment.

627
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
We'll see how quickly they
can resume that activity.

628
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:08,099
But that is going to make it
very, very hard for them to meet

629
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,733
the initial targets that are
outlined in the trade agreement.

630
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,533
The expiration for those
deadlines is coming up in April.

631
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,265
We will see if the U.S. administration gives them any

632
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,266
leeway on meeting those targets.

633
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:24,366
But the tensions between us
and them are likely going to

634
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:29,066
continue to be at a heightened
pace and we're going to continue

635
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:33,566
to see intrusions from them into
our private sector to help their

636
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:36,533
own companies.

637
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,733
And this IP theft trend,
hopefully you have seen this

638
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,599
throughout the course
of the presentation, is going

639
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,633
to continue.

640
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,566
You are going to have more and
more countries jumping into

641
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:44,500
this sphere.

642
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,166
We have seen Vietnam, we have
seen North Korea, we have

643
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,200
seen Pakistan.

644
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:51,900
India in the past as well has
targeted western firms for

645
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,166
intellectual property.

646
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,299
South Korea.

647
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,533
And the big question
mark is who is next?

648
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,332
Now that this norm has been
established that we do not

649
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,266
respond in an effective way, at
least not until recently, to

650
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,566
economic espionage being
conducted against us, who else

651
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:11,300
is going to decide that this is
too lucrative to pass on and we

652
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:14,132
should continue
conducting those operations?

653
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,233
That is why I think it's very,
very important, again, from a

654
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,066
policy perspective to respond
not just to the Chinese activity

655
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:23,366
but even from the activity of
countries that are perhaps

656
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,466
friends of ours and let them
know that we will not tolerate

657
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,966
it regardless of
who it comes from.

658
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:31,866
US/5Eyes.

659
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,866
A couple of years ago, General
Nakasone who runs the U.S.

660
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:40,132
Cyber Command and the National
Security Agency has coined this

661
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,133
phrase persistent engagement
to describe what the U.S.

662
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,000
and, in some ways, its allies
are doing in cyberspace against

663
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:52,033
our enemies, the idea that we
are constantly getting into

664
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,533
their networks both for
intelligence collection purposes

665
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,300
and signaling purposes and
continuously engaging with them

666
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:01,233
in what they call gray space,
other places around the world

667
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,166
that both actors
are operating in.

668
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,500
That strategy is likely to
get even more aggressive.

669
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:10,933
Restrictions on their operations
have been recently relaxed by

670
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,699
the administration, and it used
to be that to conduct major

671
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:17,733
operations in this domain, you
had to get White House approval.

672
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,133
Now you don't.

673
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,966
And the U.S. is very aggressively stepping into

674
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:26,766
this realm, believing that we are taking blows right now and

675
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,500
that we're not responding sufficiently, and I think you

676
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:33,633
will see a lot more aggressive stance going forward against

677
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,033
the major threat actors.

678
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,900
More indictments and
sanctions are coming.

679
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:42,232
It's been amazing to watch
what's happened just in the last

680
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,866
two to three years.

681
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,366
I remember a short time ago, 6-7
years ago, when you couldn't

682
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:51,066
find a single U.S. government official in any part of the

683
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,466
government that would say the words China and cyber even in

684
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:54,766
the same sentence.

685
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,099
This is when industry was
talking about this nonstop,

686
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,266
doing attribution reports, and
all the rest of it, and the U.S.

687
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:04,099
government really had its head
in the sand, despite the fact

688
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,766
that, from classified sources,
they knew very well what was

689
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,433
happening but they
weren't willing to acknowledge

690
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
it publicly.

691
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:12,933
To now where it's seemingly
every week new indictments come

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,266
out, new information is
released, names are unveiled of

693
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:21,466
who is doing what across all
the major threat actors, China,

694
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:23,598
Iran, Russia, North Korea.

695
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,433
I think a lot more
action is coming.

696
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:29,799
And one of the interesting
things to note has been this

697
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:33,266
idea of collective attribution
and collective action that the

698
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,500
U.S. government has
been trying to pioneer.

699
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:38,299
You may have seen last week
the announcement from the U.S.

700
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:42,066
government and our allies, such
as the UK and others that have

701
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,000
joined in, on attribution to
Russia of the recent attacks

702
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:48,466
against Georgia
back in the fall.

703
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,833
And you may have wondered why
are they doing this action?

704
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,266
Why are they highlighting
attacks against Georgia?

705
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,300
It's not even a NATO country.

706
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,033
This is one of the things that
they have been increasingly

707
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,966
thinking about of how do you get
all countries on board with this

708
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,799
name and shame tactic where
we're going to name a threat

709
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:08,666
actor for something that they
are doing that we object to in

710
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,866
cyberspace and we're going to
try to get as many allies both

711
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:15,833
in NATO and outside of NATO
on board with this collective

712
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,766
demarche, collective name and
shame action, and perhaps even

713
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,566
expulsion of diplomats and other
things that we have seen happen

714
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:23,366
over the years.

715
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:24,866
You will see a lot
more of that coming up.

716
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,566
And one prediction
is very easy to make.

717
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,765
We're not going to have cyber
peace any time soon, I'm sorry

718
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,800
to say.

719
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:36,566
All countries in this realm
are jumping into this space.

720
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:40,366
We're not going to have cyber
war either, I don't believe,

721
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,099
because the reality is that,
in this domain, what's most

722
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:48,199
effective is for countries to
operate below that threshold of

723
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,500
the use of force.

724
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,198
This is where
cyber really shines.

725
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,733
If you want to have kinetic
damage, there are other ways to

726
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,199
do that, and we have seen that
with Iran, with limpid mines,

727
00:37:57,266 --> 00:38:00,666
and drone attacks, and all kinds
of other operations that they

728
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:01,766
can do.

729
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:04,300
Very, very hard to achieve that
in cyber, if not impossible.

730
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,366
But that threshold below the
use of force is where you can

731
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:12,000
achieve a lot without triggering
a major response from the

732
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:14,665
country that you are inflicting
this damage on, and that's what

733
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,266
makes this domain so hard for
policymakers to respond to

734
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:21,300
because it's painful enough
where you can't ignore it, but

735
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:25,300
the pain is not high enough for
you to go to war or take other

736
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:29,033
major actions that could
potentially resonate back on our

737
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,300
economy or on our security.

738
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:35,133
A couple of other
things I want to go through.

739
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,166
Again, sort of feeling
unencumbered by commercial

740
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,333
interest, I want to give you my
sort of thoughts on strategy

741
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,666
going forward.

742
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,766
One of the things that I find
really frustrating about walking

743
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:48,166
the show floor at this
conference and other conferences

744
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:53,633
like this is that we inundate
practitioners with advice.

745
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,900
All of it is
legitimate good advice.

746
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,799
You should use two-factor, you
should use encryption, you

747
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:02,866
should do web security, you
should patch, on and on and on.

748
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,699
But the reality is that
no one can do it all.

749
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,733
Unless your organization is the
unique one out there that has

750
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,633
unlimited resources, unlimited
budget, unlimited time, you're

751
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,633
not going to be in the
position to do it all.

752
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,199
How do we prioritize?

753
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:18,699
When you're walking the show
floor and vendors are trying to

754
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:22,266
grab you in to talk to you about
their great solution, they're

755
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,500
not just pitching their
solution, but they're also

756
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:27,399
trying to convince you that the
problem that they're focused on,

757
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,466
which is likely a legitimate
problem, is the problem that you

758
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:32,933
should spend your money on right
now, ignoring everything else.

759
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,400
And, of course, part of the
problem is how do you decide

760
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:37,500
what's more important?

761
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,866
Is it more important to deploy
two-factor right now, or is it

762
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,366
more important to do endpoint
security, or is it more

763
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,166
important to do web security?

764
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:47,699
And the answer is really
tough because it depends.

765
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,199
It depends on your threat model.

766
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:52,099
Which of these actors that we
just talked about are going to

767
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,400
be the most impactful
to your organization?

768
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,299
Do you even care
about nation states?

769
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:58,666
Do you care about ransomware?

770
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,400
You have to think through how
those actors operate, what are

771
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,966
they likely to do in your
environment, what are their

772
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:08,066
TTPs, tactics, techniques, and
procedures, so that you can

773
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,399
start thinking of how to
prioritize your resources

774
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:11,699
against that particular threat?

775
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,366
And the key thing that I think
we need to talk more about in

776
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:19,066
this industry are the tradeoffs
because nothing is free, not

777
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:22,732
just in terms of monetary
outcomes, but also in terms of

778
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,966
your time, in terms of your
resources, and you need to

779
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:28,000
appreciate that when you're
doing one thing, let's say

780
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,232
deploying two-factor,
you're probably not doing

781
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,666
something else.

782
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,900
How you prioritize that really
depends on your strategy.

783
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:35,966
Right?

784
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:41,199
If your network is very well
insulated, maybe you only have a

785
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:44,766
couple of ways in and it's
going to be very, very hard for

786
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,800
someone to infiltrate it, maybe
your resources need to be spent

787
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:53,199
more on hygiene of those
external assets that are going

788
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:55,000
to be the way in
for an attacker.

789
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:58,232
You can sort of have that choke
point and stop them there.

790
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,000
If your network is more
distributed, if you have

791
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:03,165
employees everywhere working
remotely, maybe you need to take

792
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:05,266
the strategy of someone is going
to get through, they're going to

793
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:09,066
get in, let's hunt for them,
let's find them before they

794
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,366
accomplish any damage.

795
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:13,266
And we need to start thinking
more about those tradeoffs as

796
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,633
we're making decisions
about how to employ our

797
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:16,633
security solutions.

798
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,933
A couple of other trends that
I want to talk about before

799
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
we end.

800
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:24,732
First of all, obviously, you
know, I'm biased because this is

801
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,599
what I'm doing with the next
phase of my life, but I believe

802
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,800
policy truly is
the next frontier.

803
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:32,300
I think the tech sector, in
general, and cybersecurity

804
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,400
industry more specifically, has
made a huge mistake in the last

805
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:38,400
20 years by not appreciating the
power of governments, not just

806
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:41,299
the power of governments in
doing in cyber operations, but

807
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,300
the power of government to
regulate us and make our lives

808
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:45,400
very, very difficult.

809
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:48,766
I remember the talk back in the
'90s and even early 2000s that

810
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,066
there are no
borders on the internet.

811
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,665
That was nonsense.

812
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,866
There are absolutely borders.

813
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:57,633
Physical infrastructure lives
somewhere, companies operate

814
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,666
somewhere, people are in various
locations, government can use

815
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:05,266
the power of their law
enforcement, the power of their

816
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,833
economies to force us to
do things we don't like.

817
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,466
And regulations are coming.

818
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:11,966
Obviously, we have seen GDPR.

819
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:14,266
We have seen the California
privacy law that went into

820
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,433
effect this year.

821
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,900
But I can tell you as someone
who lives in DC, policymakers

822
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:23,165
are uniquely interested in this
space right now and they're not

823
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:26,000
interested in doing
less regulations.

824
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:29,033
There is a lot of talk right now
in so-called section 230, which

825
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:32,500
is part of the Communications
Decency Act, related to giving

826
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:35,466
liabilities to big platform
companies about content that

827
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,066
they have on their systems.

828
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:41,500
Very likely that liability
provision will either go

829
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:43,098
away entirely.

830
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,599
There's bipartisan support for
that now given what has been

831
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,599
happening on Facebook and
Twitter and all these different

832
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,966
platforms the last
couple of years.

833
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,533
It will be changed very
radically going forward.

834
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:54,566
Encryption.

835
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,533
I remember living through the
'90s in the first crypto war.

836
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,866
We're in the second phase of
it now, or maybe the tenth,

837
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:02,300
depending on how you count it.

838
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:06,333
You heard the Justice Department
yesterday talking about it here

839
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
at this conference.

840
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:09,433
They want to do
something on this.

841
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:15,000
They believe they have
bipartisan support for getting

842
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:18,466
some sort of provision to
require tech companies to

843
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,333
enable access.

844
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,699
We'll see what
comes out of that.

845
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,266
But given some of the terrorist
attacks that have been occurring

846
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:27,000
recently, given the incredible
rise in child exploitation

847
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:30,433
cases, there's a lot
of political support to

848
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,566
do something.

849
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:35,598
That's usually not a good thing
when the politicians want to do

850
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,800
something, but they
don't know exactly what.

851
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,766
Very rarely something
good comes of that.

852
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:41,466
Data breach laws.

853
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:44,366
A lot of talk about national
data breach notification law.

854
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:46,566
Something may happen in the
next couple of years there.

855
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:50,866
And one of the things that is
important to realize is we've

856
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:54,166
had tremendous amount of talk
and energy expended over the

857
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:55,833
last few years
talking about norms.

858
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,266
And there's been this group
inside the UN of major

859
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:05,566
countries, GGE, that was focused
on how do we come together and

860
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,832
establish norms, like not
hitting civilian infrastructure,

861
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,699
not attacking countries' certs,
and a number of other things

862
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:13,033
that they've been promoting.

863
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,233
And the reality is that all of
that effort was pretty much

864
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,266
useless, I'm sorry to say,
because norms have been

865
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,466
established de facto either
through government action in

866
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,699
this domain or lack of it.

867
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:27,266
When we have not responded to
economic espionage, we have

868
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,866
established a norm that has
now resulted in this massive

869
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,599
proliferation of IP theft that
has taken place from a variety

870
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,133
of different
countries against us.

871
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,433
When we take action in
cyberspace, we're establishing a

872
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,233
norm that that action is
allowed, and we need to be very

873
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
cognizant of that.

874
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:44,099
Private sector is not
going to be a neutral party to

875
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,000
this fight.

876
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,566
I believed even ten years
ago that if you were in the

877
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:50,299
cybersecurity industry, you
were going to be forced to take

878
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:51,366
a side.

879
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:54,800
You can't be sort of an arms
dealer selling even defensive

880
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:57,933
tools to everyone, and we're
starting to see that with

881
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,366
controversies over Huawei,
Kaspersky, and others coming to

882
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:02,566
the fore.

883
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,832
That's only going to be
exacerbated going forward.

884
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,400
If you think that as a
cybersecurity organization you

885
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:10,933
are going to be able to do
business in Russia or China or

886
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,066
even broader IT organizations in
the near future, I think you're

887
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,299
deluding yourself.

888
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:19,766
Technology, I want to spend a
couple of minutes talking about

889
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,333
the trends that I'm seeing there
because I do think we're going

890
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,766
to see some really remarkable
changes coming to the fore in

891
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,300
terms of how adversaries
are leveraging these new

892
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:30,733
capabilities that
are coming forward.

893
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,099
The reality is that offense
is getting harder and harder.

894
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:37,033
When you think about the cost of
compromising an iPhone device or

895
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,933
even an Android device, that
has risen dramatically over the

896
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,099
years into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars to buy

897
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:46,699
those exploits, to purchase the
malware that can run on them.

898
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:51,199
Increasingly, the companies have
done a great job of shoring up

899
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:54,833
those platforms, those operating
systems both on the mobile

900
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,800
device side as well as on the
traditional operating system

901
00:45:57,866 --> 00:46:00,233
side, creating these
walled gardens where it's very

902
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,366
difficult to operate,
but not impossible.

903
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:05,099
And one of the trends that I
think we're going to see going

904
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:10,433
forward is that persistence for
malware will migrate down to

905
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,433
the application.

906
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,266
So instead of getting your
malware to live in a kernel

907
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:18,066
which is going to be harder and
harder, Apple just basically

908
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,000
kicked everyone out of the
kernel with their latest update

909
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:24,500
that's coming up in a few
weeks here, including security

910
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:29,165
vendors, by the way, but instead
of living there, you're going to

911
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:32,066
say I'm going to live in the
browser and, yes, I'm going to

912
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:35,332
lose access upon a reboot,
potentially, so the notion of

913
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,266
persistence where I can put my
malware on a system, and until

914
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,733
I'm discovered for months or
years, I'm going to live there.

915
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,733
I think that notion is going
away and offensive teams are

916
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,166
starting to appreciate that you
may have to reacquire targets

917
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:51,333
continuously or you may have to
do smash and grab operations to

918
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,133
quickly accomplish
your objective.

919
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,366
And to the extent that you need
to maintain persistence, it may

920
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,800
be in the browser, it may be in
the messaging app someone is

921
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:01,800
using, that's where you're going
to persist some of your code in

922
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:04,500
memory to try to
accomplish your objectives.

923
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:07,566
That's also going to make it
very difficult for defenders to

924
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:11,098
find it because those tools
are not an instrumental as the

925
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,166
operating system.

926
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:14,366
Your ability to get visibility
into what's going on inside

927
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:17,533
those processes is very limited
and it's going to create all

928
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,800
sorts of new challenges for us.

929
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:23,699
Kubernetes containers, obviously
very, very hot technology.

930
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:26,199
Most organizations are either
toying with it right now or

931
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:29,166
deploying those technologies,
and we're going to see them

932
00:47:29,233 --> 00:47:33,433
become really the
new operating system.

933
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,400
New attacks are going to emerge
that are specifically targeting

934
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:38,598
Kubernetes APIs,
container technologies.

935
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:43,733
So we're not just going to see
attacks on traditional operating

936
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,333
systems,
traditional applications.

937
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,866
You need to start thinking about
that whole ecosystem as its own

938
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:49,733
standalone unit.

939
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,300
And the thing that I worry
the most about is source

940
00:47:52,366 --> 00:47:53,433
code manipulation.

941
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,000
We have seen some supply chain
attacks, most famously with the

942
00:47:57,066 --> 00:48:01,265
Juniper code that was backdoored
and a number of security vendors

943
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,233
have experienced the same thing.

944
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,366
I'm surprised we have not seeing
more of these, and it's quite

945
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,400
possible that they have occurred
and we just haven't caught them.

946
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:11,165
When you have an insider,
particularly in your

947
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,766
organization, not even an
external threat actor, that is

948
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:17,333
putting back doors in your code,
that is authorized to do so,

949
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,000
really, really hard to catch
in modern massive source

950
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,098
code systems.

951
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:25,766
Obviously, you also have added
risk from open-source packages

952
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:29,766
and the like that
gets added to this.

953
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,500
And then, strategy.

954
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:33,399
Last point.

955
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:36,933
Stanley Baldwin, the UK Prime
Minister in the 1930s, in the

956
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,566
lead-up to World War II, in his
argument that the UK should not

957
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:45,366
be rearming in the wake of
Germany rearming, he said the

958
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:47,066
bomber will always get through.

959
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,698
In a way, saying that it's
futile to fight because there

960
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,800
will be massive destruction when
these Air Forces that have been

961
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:58,900
built by nations after World
War I will start flying in and

962
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:02,732
destroying cities and making
life unbearable for populations.

963
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,733
He was wrong.

964
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,599
It turns out that you can
actually inflict massive cost on

965
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:12,133
Air Forces with technologies
like radar and AAA missiles and

966
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,199
the like.

967
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:16,333
But in cyber, it actually is
true because the cost that you

968
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,766
can inflict on someone just by
catching them are actually very,

969
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:19,866
very limited.

970
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:23,500
That's why we continue to see
these intrusions happening where

971
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:27,366
the adversaries can keep on
trying until they're successful.

972
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:30,599
And the assumption does need to
be, I believe, that you will

973
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:31,833
have an intrusion.

974
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,866
It doesn't mean you will have
a compromise, but you need to

975
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:34,966
react faster.

976
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:37,900
The good news is that stuff is
becoming harder and harder,

977
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:40,933
adversaries are getting caught
more frequently, and dwell time

978
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,900
is coming down dramatically as
we've just recently seen from

979
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:45,665
the Mandiant
M-Trends report as well.

980
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,199
So people are
catching them faster.

981
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:51,866
It needs to be a lot faster
than now, but, nevertheless.

982
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:53,233
Deterrents are
largely ineffective.

983
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,633
That's something that I am going
to be passionate about over the

984
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:59,533
next phase of my career
working on those issues.

985
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,833
And inside infiltrations at
large tech companies, both

986
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,033
cybersecurity companies and
large platform companies.

987
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,166
It's going to be a huge issue.

988
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:09,933
Twitter recently saw a problem
with Saudis infiltrating people

989
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,833
inside their networks.

990
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,566
Persistent engagement, everyone
in this room is persistently

991
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:15,698
engaged with adversary.

992
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:17,833
It's not just a term
that U.S. Cyber Command uses.

993
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:21,433
And finally, the silver lining
I'll end the talk on is that

994
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,933
offenses against hard target
is actually becoming more and

995
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,966
more costly.

996
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:27,400
So companies that are doing
well, organizations that are

997
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:30,232
doing well are actually able to
defend themselves, even against

998
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,099
the most
sophisticated adversaries.

999
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,633
You just need to make it a
priority and invest in it.

1000
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,300
Thank you very much.

1001
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,366
Hope you enjoyed it.

1002
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,733
And I hope to have
your help in the future.

1003
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,633
Thank you.
