00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:03,338
(soft calming music)

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,709
- With quantum, the
potential is limitless.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,710
Immunologists one day, will discover

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,380
the Rosetta Stone for a universal vaccine,

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,930
putting the flu and
countless other diseases

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,730
out of commission.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,153
But progress isn't waiting for quantum.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,860
Our current cloud computing architectures

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,509
allows scientists to tackle
the problems of today,

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,580
to fight disease, to explore the universe,

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,610
to power human progress.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,100
Let's not hinder our future

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,930
by remaining blind to the threats

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,683
that target these platforms.

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,590
Are we up for the challenge?

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,313
We can't wait for time to tell.
