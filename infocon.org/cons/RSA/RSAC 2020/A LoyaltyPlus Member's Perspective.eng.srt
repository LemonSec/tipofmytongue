1
00:00:00,593 --> 00:00:03,510
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,619
- Oh, six or seven over the years, yeah.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,310
It's changed quite a bit

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,910
'cause it's not quite as cliquish

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,540
as maybe the very first time.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,669
You know, not as insular.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,560
And so that's good to see,

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,140
that this really reaching
a broader audience.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,930
Here I get a real perspective

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,890
on the connection between some

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,640
of the technical aspects of security

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,560
and then what are the
concerns of business leaders.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,852
And then really how to
hook those together.
