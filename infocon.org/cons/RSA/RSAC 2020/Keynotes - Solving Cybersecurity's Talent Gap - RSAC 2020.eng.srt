1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,708
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,310
- We need more talent, a lot more.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm sure you've seen the
same statistics that I have.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,250
The estimates of unfilled
cybersecurity jobs,

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,210
range from 1.8 million to
nearly 4 million by 2022.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,000
For the long term success
of virtually every business

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,380
that exists within a digital ecosystem,

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,450
we must fill the talent gap.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,750
And not just with anyone,
but with everyone.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,439
Women and minorities
continue to be severely

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,599
underrepresented in the
IT and engineering fields.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,220
So we've started our
outreach even earlier,

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,440
as young as middle school

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,930
to encourage them to
pursue rewarding careers.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,700
- I don't think I need to tell anybody

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,740
in this room that cyber is hard.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,870
It's extremely challenging, it's exciting,

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,410
there's always something new.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,449
And, those are a lot of the reasons

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,680
why we are even in this industry.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,670
That's why we like doing cyber.

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,090
It's exciting and fun and
we want the challenge.

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,820
Cyber is also a very high
risk, high reward environment.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,470
It's hard work and there's
equivalent stress to go with it.

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,740
Some of these are the
good types of stress.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,110
We like challenges, challenges are fun.

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,670
That's why we do it.

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,560
- At age 11, a girl
named Aditi Shah in India

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,110
was diagnosed with a genetic disorder

30
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,810
that gradually decreases
a person's vision.

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,570
At age 15, she was
almost completely blind,

32
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,050
only able to see light and dark.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,679
She had to relearn how learn.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,820
But through hard work,

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,949
she made it all the way to Georgia Tech

36
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,570
where she completed her master's
degree in cyber security.

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,300
She joined Microsoft last December

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,890
as a cyber security software intern,

39
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,170
and I'm really looking
forward to the great things

40
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,050
that she is going to accomplish.

41
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,463
I also have a really special
sauce spot for Aditi.

42
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,699
I was also born With a
genetic vision defect.

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,110
I have no vision in my right eye.

44
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,360
For years, I hid that,

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,550
because I was afraid kids in
school would make fun of me.

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,840
As an adult I hid it

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,000
because I was afraid employers
would deny me opportunity,

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,393
they would see me as somehow defective.

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,730
So if you're responsible
for hiring people,

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,440
you need to consider the
challenges folks overcome.

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,130
And you need to do the extra
work to find people like Aditi

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,109
because the ideas they will bring

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,243
to your organization, are invaluable.

54
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,109
I'm excited for our
future, because I believe

55
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,890
in the fundamental
goodness of most people.

56
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,170
The young people digging
for vulnerabilities

57
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,679
in our system today, are exactly
the people I want to hire

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,690
to guarantee our security of the future.

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,380
- Finally, we need to rethink our culture

60
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,340
and shift from a culture of elitism

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,540
to a culture of inclusion.

62
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,679
Expanding our talent pool,
filling the talent gap,

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,850
however, you look at it,

64
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,570
requires finding defenders
outside the tech community.

65
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,410
Let's stop being stem snobs.

66
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,160
- We can figure out how
to do this together.

67
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,090
You can see all the
resources we have available,

68
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,100
but more importantly, we're hiring,

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,023
come work with us.

70
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,606
