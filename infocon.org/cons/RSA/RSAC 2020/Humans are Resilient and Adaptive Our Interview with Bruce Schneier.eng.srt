1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
(piano music)

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,669
- If humans are anything,

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:09,120
it's that we are resilient and adaptive.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,084
We've figured our way out of

5
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,580
a lot of really bad problems.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
Our society has improved
century over century.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,210
It's a slow process, it's a noisy process,

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,060
there's back-sliding, but we are

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,669
much better off than
we were 100 years ago,

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,730
200 years ago, 500 years
ago, 1000 years ago.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,050
I don't think that's gonna change.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,479
We have a security mindset.

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,028
We think about systems in terms of

14
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:37,863
adversaries and threats
and vulnerabilities

15
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:40,263
and security solutions.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,780
Whether it is a system like Facebook,

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,930
a system like a computer, or a system

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,193
like our democracy,

19
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,849
they have the kind of

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,130
moving components that I think

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,010
we have unique insight into.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,126
Once we figure that out, the question is,

23
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:57,200
"What do we do with it?

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,670
Do we influence policy?

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,228
Do we go work on congressional staffs

26
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,134
in government agencies?"

27
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:08,040
Broadly, I want to see
us engage in policy.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,780
We just now need to learn to communicate

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,406
what we do to an audience of lay people.

30
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,960
Just like doctors do,
just like engineers do,

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,616
just like everybody does.

32
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,040
The more we can do that, I think

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,160
the better we'll be.

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,560
It's okay to specialize.

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,393
I don't think a society works

36
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,390
unless we all specialize.

37
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,372
We need to still be able
to talk to each other.

38
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:29,530
There's so much going on at RSA,

39
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,965
it's impossible to do it all.

40
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,280
If you don't come in with a strategy,

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,100
you rapidly get overwhelmed.

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,570
You walk onto the show floor.

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,589
There are hundreds, maybe
a thousand companies,

44
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:41,200
and they're all trying
to sell you something.

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,513
That's hard.

46
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:44,853
Before you go, especially if you're new,

47
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:47,820
read up on it. See what's here.

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,649
Pick a few things that you need to go see.

49
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,460
Whether they're speakers
or panels or companies

50
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,440
or events, go do those and then

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,423
don't overdo it.

52
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,139
You can spend all day at the conference

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,470
and all night at parties and do that

54
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,303
for 3 days.

55
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:06,330
It makes for a really bad week.

56
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,350
So pace yourself, and
read up on what's here.

57
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,493
There's an enormous amount here.

58
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:13,910
(piano music continues)
