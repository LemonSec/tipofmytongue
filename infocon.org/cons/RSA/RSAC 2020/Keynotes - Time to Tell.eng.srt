1
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,900
>> ANNOUNCER: Please welcome
Senior Vice President and Chief

2
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,599
Technology Officer
McAfee, Steve Grobman.

3
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,000
>> STEVE GROBMAN: I'm
excited to be here.

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,099
As CTO of McAfee, I'm the geek
that gets to write code on a

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,433
plane and give it to
my team when I land.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,866
They love that.

7
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,000
But I'm also one of you.

8
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:37,733
After twenty years on the front
lines fighting cyber threats, I

9
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,666
now have McAfee's CISO and
CIO teams reporting to me.

10
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:46,166
So, like you, I worry about
defending my organization every

11
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,699
hour of every day.

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,633
I'm also a recent Texan.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,500
In 2017, along with my wife and
two dogs, I moved to the Lone

14
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,566
Star State.

15
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,966
What I didn't realize at the
time is that Texas in general,

16
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:05,500
and DFW Airport specifically,
is known as ground zero for

17
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,000
infectious disease
in the United States.

18
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:14,133
DFW is the crossroads of 65
million passengers from every

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,933
corner of the planet.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,366
But we don't have to look to
Dallas for the largest threat to

21
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:24,766
global health because there's
one threat that reliably kills

22
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,798
hundreds of
thousands every year.

23
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:28,533
The flu.

24
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:35,500
Last year alone, 45 million
cases of flu led to 60,000

25
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:37,766
deaths. Why?

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,233
Isn't the answer simple?

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,099
It's a called the flu shot.

28
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,433
Of course, we know if the answer
were so simple, we'd simply

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,099
inoculate everyone with the
flu shot and call it a day.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,833
But like cybersecurity, our
defense against influenza is an

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,333
imprecise science.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,299
There are many factors.

33
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,933
The effectiveness of the
vaccine, the transmissibility of

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,299
the strain, its lethality.

35
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:07,966
Factors vary year by year with
very different outcomes as you

36
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:10,799
see in the five years
that we simulated here.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,966
Last month, the NIH announced
that this year's outbreak is on

38
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,833
track to be the
worst in a decade.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,400
Now, we decided to use the flu
as a metaphor for cybersecurity

40
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,866
back in December, clearly not
knowing that the Coronavirus

41
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,733
would impact friends and
colleagues around the world.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,333
The point being that infectious
disease requires a spectrum of

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,033
actions from sophisticated
technology to fundamental,

44
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,166
simple, basic principles
like, as you just heard,

45
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:46,900
washing hands.

46
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,099
Consider the challenges of
some of the most fundamental

47
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,833
principals in our world.

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,633
Are we being aggressive enough
in the way that we share threat

49
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,900
intelligence? No.

50
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:02,633
We must move beyond the hash and
move to higher fidelity threat

51
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:03,533
sharing paradigms.

52
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,965
Are we patching fast enough
to resolve fundamental

53
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:14,000
implementation flaws in all of
the components that we count on?

54
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,066
No.

55
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:20,066
We've been dealing with patch
Tuesday for seventeen years and

56
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,833
patching for much longer.

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,933
We recognize the criticality of
patching, but the data suggests

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,500
we're collectively not moving
fast enough to patch known

59
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,966
vulnerabilities,
including those that can have

60
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:34,965
significant impacts.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,500
Take BlueKeep, a 9.8
out of 10 CVSS score.

62
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,566
It was announced last June.

63
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,166
This is a vulnerability that
takes advantages in flaws in

64
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,733
remote desktop protocol that can
allow an attacker to have remote

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
code execution.

66
00:03:54,466 --> 00:04:01,033
Today, eight months later, we've
addressed only 60% of internet

67
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,198
facing systems.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,566
Take another example.

69
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,233
EternalBlue.

70
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,333
The underlying vulnerability
that WannaCry used to spread

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,933
around the globe to impact
nearly a quarter of a million

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,199
machines in 150 countries went
from an epidemic to a pandemic

73
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:22,933
in one day.

74
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,466
Almost three years later,
McAfee's threat sensor array

75
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:33,199
detects exploitation of
EternalBlue as its top network

76
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:39,766
exploit, making EternalBlue
truly eternal because

77
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,833
significant populations of
machines are still not patched.

78
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:50,633
And this January 14th, once
again we're racing to patch.

79
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,500
It seems like every Christmas
or New Year's our industry gets

80
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:58,732
some sort of special present,
whether it's Spectre/Meltdown or

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,266
Grizzly Steppe or this
year's literal Curveball.

82
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,466
What makes
Curveball so dangerous?

83
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:10,899
It destroys trust in the
building blocks that we rely on

84
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,833
for everything that we do.

85
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,933
Abusing Curveball, an adversary
consigned files and made them

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,566
appear as part of
the operating system.

87
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,566
Or impersonate a secure website.

88
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,866
What does it take
to abuse Curveball?

89
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,433
Download and run
ten lines of code.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
That's right, just ten lines.

91
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,433
Which is why just days after the
vulnerability was made public,

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,800
multiple proof of concepts
were readily available, many

93
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,832
incredibly simple to use.

94
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:49,100
And social media enhances rapid
collaboration of these POCs and

95
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,399
makes it such that once they
become viable, the recipe is

96
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:57,300
spread around the
world in seconds.

97
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:01,066
This lowering of the barrier to
exploitation exacerbates our

98
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,599
challenge, even
for complex attacks.

99
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,800
In 2017, the SHAttered
team created the first

100
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,399
SHA1 collision.

101
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:16,100
It took 6,610 years
of processor time.

102
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:20,300
Today, their collision can be
used to create two documents

103
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:25,599
with the same SHA1 hash not in
6,000 years but in less than

104
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,666
60 seconds.

105
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,265
It took us less than a minute
using a public script from the

106
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,766
internet to take these two
documents and collide them, so

107
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:41,533
they have the same SHA1 hash
which, as you can see, documents

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,399
from both RSA 2020
and 2019 would be shown as

109
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:47,333
being identical.

110
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,333
Now of course, if you want to
create our own SHA1 collision,

111
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,899
that will cost you about $50,000
of Cloud compute resource.

112
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,166
That's a bit expensive for a
keynote demonstration, even here

113
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,533
at RSA.

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,133
But it's a true bargain
if you are a nation state.

115
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,765
So, if we can't trust our
digital signatures or trust that

116
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,366
hashes are unique, how
do we protect trust?

117
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:19,300
How do we mitigate risk when we
know critical vulnerabilities

118
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,399
will continue to be found
at an accelerated rate?

119
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:28,733
With every patch, we expose
our organizations to risk.

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,899
Patching means change and change
can be destabilizing, which

121
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,733
means that we have
incentives to defer and delay.

122
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,833
We want to know how a patch is
going to affect our environment

123
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,699
because we know that
making changes can have

124
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,366
adverse effects.

125
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,800
Things can break.

126
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,500
Performance can degrade.

127
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:50,899
Your business can suffer.

128
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:56,699
Yet the risk of not patching,
especially as the attacks become

129
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:01,600
more sophisticated, is
unacceptable, especially as the

130
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,766
attacks surface grows.

131
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,366
So, to patch now or patch later.

132
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,166
We've answered this question.

133
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:14,733
McAfee, like each of you, is
moving to the Cloud, a paradigm

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,699
where we now delegate the
onerous task of software updates

135
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,766
and patches.

136
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,633
But lifting and shifting
outdated architectures does

137
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,333
little to solve the problem.

138
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,533
The value of Cloud only
kicks in when we move to a

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,166
Cloud native architecture.

140
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:36,099
Cloud native solutions use
foundational building blocks

141
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,933
that snap together to build
sophisticated capabilities.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But with Cloud comes new
threats, Cloud native threats.

143
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,966
Some of these are related
to configuration errors.

144
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:55,133
Configuring the Cloud is
difficult because Cloud requires

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,866
inherently more sophisticated
policies which add complexity

146
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,366
and are subject to error.

147
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:05,766
This is made worse in that
often, things default access to

148
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,366
the internet, a public network.

149
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,933
So, it's easier to make errors
and when you make those errors,

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,333
they're exposed to the world.

151
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:19,965
And new paradigms have nuance
that if not comprehended can

152
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:25,633
expose your organization
to catastrophic outcomes.

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,533
For example, all of the major
public Cloud providers have

154
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,299
capabilities to manage
credentials for cloud

155
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,633
native applications.

156
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,399
Used correctly, these
capabilities allow you to not

157
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,533
pass credentials in the
clear or store them in source

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,533
code repositories.

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,000
One of these is called
Instance Metadata, but if not

160
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:52,700
comprehended can
set an organization up for

161
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:55,333
complete compromise.

162
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,333
Let's look at a
typical scenario.

163
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,500
With Cloud's low barrier to
entry, a team of epidemiologists

164
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:05,666
set up a public dashboard to
show information on their

165
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:09,733
progress in analyzing the genome
of a critical virus, say,

166
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,566
Covid-19 as shown here.

167
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,899
The challenge they have is many
of the resources the dashboard

168
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:20,666
requires are not accessible to
the internet, only their virtual

169
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,465
private Cloud.

170
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,533
The solution is simple.

171
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
They can use a reverse proxy
which acts as a middleman to

172
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,866
pull the data that's
not directly exposed.

173
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:35,733
So, a fast online search shows
they can do this with a few

174
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,799
lines of code.

175
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:44,799
Their basic solution is elegant
and functions perfectly, but it

176
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:48,100
set up their organization
for a massive breach.

177
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,566
Why?

178
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:54,699
What they didn't realize,
they're epidemiologists not RSA

179
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:59,033
attendees for goodness sake, is
that their reverse proxy will

180
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,533
access both intended
and unintended data.

181
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,566
One of the pieces of unintended
data that they didn't even know

182
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:11,966
exist is Instance Metadata
which is a cloud native feature

183
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:16,700
exposed to the compute instance
to provide data about the

184
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:23,033
instance, including sensitive
information such as credentials

185
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,399
which the reverse proxy can
also access and return to

186
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,333
the attacker.

187
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,166
With the credentials, the
attacker may well have access to

188
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,766
highly sensitive
Cloud resources.

189
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:40,299
Let's walk through this from
the attacker's perspective and

190
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,833
look at exactly what it would
look like to execute this type

191
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:44,566
of attack.

192
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,933
Okay, so here we are on
the attacker's machine.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,799
The first thing that we're going
to do is validate that we don't

194
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,466
have access to
anything by default.

195
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:59,433
Next, when we looked at the
epidemiologist's dashboard, we

196
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,399
noticed that they referenced
the reverse proxy.

197
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,366
So, here we're going to
simply confirm connectivity.

198
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:12,500
Now let's see if the reverse
proxy can access the special URL

199
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,866
where Instance
Metadata is stored.

200
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,833
Specifically, we look to see if
access privileges were granted.

201
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,233
And we see that they were.

202
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,233
It looks like this instance
has full S3 access.

203
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,833
So, this is promising.

204
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,766
Let's go ahead and see if we can
actually pull those credentials.

205
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,100
We can.

206
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,766
We have the credentials.

207
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,132
This is the Holy Grail that
the attacker is looking for.

208
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:45,100
At this point, all we have to do
is set our attacker machine to

209
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,533
use the credentials.

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,399
We can do this by setting the
Access Key ID, secret key, and

211
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,700
session token
environment variables.

212
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:56,665
Once we have those, we can go
ahead and see what information

213
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:57,899
we have access to.

214
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,299
For example, can
we see any buckets?

215
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:04,566
In this case, it looks like
there's this Santa genome top

216
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,600
secret thing.

217
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,899
I don't really know what that
is, but let's go ahead and

218
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:12,299
exfiltrate it with
a simple S3 sync.

219
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:16,933
We have now stolen the
top-secret data with that simple

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
of an attack.

221
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:25,632
This insidious attack is
just one of forty-three

222
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,333
Cloud-specific techniques
on MITRE's attack matrix.

223
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:36,033
Now, insidious threats aside,
Cloud brings us access to new

224
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,700
technologies that
organizations would otherwise

225
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:40,866
not have access to.

226
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:48,100
One exciting technology holding
great promise and that will fit

227
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:53,966
well into the Cloud model
is quantum as a service.

228
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,966
But for our industry, as with
Cloud, we know that quantum is a

229
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:58,899
double-edged sword.

230
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,166
Quantum computing will allow
us to achieve breakthroughs in

231
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:11,733
biology, chemistry, physics,
and, of course, cybersecurity.

232
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,433
On the other hand, I'm realistic
enough to know that nation

233
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,533
states will use quantum to break
our public key crypto systems.

234
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,799
Now, I know what many of you are
thinking; quantum is not coming

235
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,866
any time soon.

236
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:32,799
But we can't think of quantum in
terms of eventually or tomorrow,

237
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:36,433
because quantum is
a real risk today.

238
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,766
You must assume that adversaries
are already accessing your most

239
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,266
sensitive data.

240
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,665
It's encrypted but they
still find it valuable.

241
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,699
They're not worried about
decrypting it today.

242
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,132
They're counting on quantum
to do that in the future.

243
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,433
Over 70% of all network traffic
is encrypted, much over an

244
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,200
untrusted network.

245
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,466
We call it the internet.

246
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:06,633
Our most critical data
lives in the Cloud.

247
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,500
Cyber criminals and nation
states can siphon off that data

248
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:14,933
today and unlock it tomorrow
when quantum cryptanalysis

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,933
becomes practical.

250
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,266
So, let's ask: Does it matter
if your data can be unlocked in

251
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,565
five, ten, fifteen
years from now?

252
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,866
Consider this.

253
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:35,665
Even in 2020, documents in the
national archives related to the

254
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:40,933
Kennedy assassination nearly
sixty years ago still retain

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,266
redactions for current
national security concerns.

256
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,933
Now, think about the
data in your environment.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,100
Two things matter.

258
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,466
Number one, of course the
sensitivity of the data; how

259
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,000
important it is.

260
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,966
But also understanding how
long it must be protected.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,466
We plotted a handful of examples
on a chart to make the case.

262
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,700
We place social security
numbers more to the left.

263
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:15,099
Clearly, we never want to lose a
social security number, but we

264
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:20,766
must be realistic that 60% to
80% are already compromised.

265
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:25,966
At the same time, they act as an
identifier across a lifetime so

266
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,433
we placed them
higher on the chart.

267
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:33,866
Contrast this with prerelease
earnings for a public company.

268
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:38,033
Given their importance before
they're released, we plot them

269
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,266
far to the right.

270
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,333
But given the brief time between
quarter and close and public

271
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,000
release, we plot
them near the bottom.

272
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,200
Finally, think about
national secrets.

273
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:55,199
Many will be at the top right.

274
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:59,165
A short story about an
ultra-secret project makes

275
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,233
the case.

276
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:05,799
When the British cracked
Germany's enigma code in 1941,

277
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,799
it provided critical information
to allied land, air and sea

278
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:14,433
forces that ultimately
shortened and won the war.

279
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,566
Yet the sensitivity of that
project was so great that even

280
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:22,833
people working on it
weren't necessarily aware of

281
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,099
the objective.

282
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:28,799
And even after victory,
we kept this story secret for

283
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:29,566
three decades.

284
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,200
The core of our future, a post
quantum ecosystem, requires

285
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,900
critical work from NIST.

286
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:44,199
We need quantum resistant
algorithms as soon as possible.

287
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:48,000
NIST is already doing amazing
work but we must help them

288
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,566
move faster.

289
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,666
They require more funding.

290
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:55,599
The quantum research
budget is $30 million.

291
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:05,666
That's 0.0006% of the federal
budget to solve a problem that's

292
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,866
a threat to national security.

293
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:10,166
And this is not an easy problem.

294
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,933
Selecting the right algorithm
is a critical decision.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
Of the initial sixty-nine
replacement algorithms that were

296
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,799
proposed, twelve were broken
or attacked in three weeks.

297
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,399
And after three years, we've
still only narrowed the field

298
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,166
to twenty-six.

299
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,099
What about the rest
of us in this room?

300
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,500
We can move our network traffic
to TLS 1.3 right now, and while

301
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:41,866
that won't prevent the traffic
from being decrypted by quantum

302
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:45,933
at some point, it does make it
significantly more difficult for

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,833
an attacker to execute at scale.

304
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,332
Let's all commit to build
post quantum action plans that

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,033
measure time and impact
sensitivity so that we're ready

306
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:01,299
to migrate the systems at the
top right of our charts as the

307
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,000
post quantum
ecosystem is ratified.

308
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,899
Finally, together,
government and industry has

309
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,933
much to do in partnership.

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,366
Let's pledge to start the
technical work beyond just the

311
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:19,466
mathematical algorithms, to
inventory, understand and retool

312
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,466
all of the systems
that are based on quantum

313
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,466
vulnerable attacks.

314
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:29,966
Whether it's driving changes
through IETF to support a post

315
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:35,500
quantum TLS or testing new
ecosystems for quantum secure

316
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:39,366
code signing capabilities,
we must begin today.

317
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,366
I'm confident we
can do these things.

318
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,633
With quantum, the
potential is limitless.

319
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,733
Immunologists one day will
discover the Rosetta Stone for a

320
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,900
universal vaccine, putting the
flu and countless other diseases

321
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,666
out of commission.

322
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,866
But progress isn't
waiting for quantum.

323
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,799
Our current Cloud computing
architectures allow scientists

324
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:09,166
to tackle the problems of today
to fight disease, to explore the

325
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,533
universe, to power
human progress.

326
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,832
Let's not hinder our future by
remaining blind to the threats

327
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,000
that target these platforms.

328
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,500
Are we up for the challenge?

329
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,866
We can't wait for time to tell.

330
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,333
Thank you.

331
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,366
