1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,133
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Dr. Celeste Paul.

2
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,166
>> CELESTE PAUL:
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,600
My name is Celeste and I'm from
the National Security Agency.

4
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,233
Today I want to talk about
something that we have been

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,166
starting a dialogue in in the
cybersecurity industry and that

6
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,833
is stress and burnout
in our operators.

7
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,366
Just a caveat, I am not a
mental health professional.

8
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:42,000
I am a cybersecurity researcher,
much like many of you here.

9
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:47,299
I got into this topic because I
saw the stress in our operators

10
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:49,799
at NSA and wanted to
do something about it.

11
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,799
If you're unfamiliar with the
National Security Agency, we're

12
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,033
a foreign intelligence agency in
the Department of Defense and we

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,666
have two primary missions.

14
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:03,399
Our first mission is our
traditional signals intelligence

15
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,566
mission and that is where we
intercept and exploit foreign

16
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,265
signals and produce intelligence
in order to support the

17
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,933
warfighter and our congressmen.

18
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:16,866
We also have the cybersecurity
mission which is where we

19
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:20,066
prevent and eradicate threats
to national security systems.

20
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,533
So, NSA cybersecurity
leverages both sides.

21
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,933
We utilize that foreign
intelligence in order to secure

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,666
our systems.

23
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,466
You might be wondering why NSA
cares so much about stress and

24
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,566
cybersecurity.

25
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:36,966
We do a lot of cyber and we also
have a lot of professionals at

26
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,766
the agency who are
working in cybersecurity.

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,066
We see a lot of the same things
that you have seen in industry

28
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:47,199
in terms of burnout and stress
in everyday operations.

29
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,033
Let's talk about stress.

30
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,599
Stress is a physical
and emotional reaction to

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,566
adverse events.

32
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,366
It is not necessarily bad or
good, it is just the way that

33
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,866
our bodies react to surprises.

34
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,766
We have good types of stress
which come from challenges or

35
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,233
unexpected events, and sometimes
this can be good because it

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,000
gives us clarity and focus
and challenges us and makes

37
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,000
something more interesting.

38
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:19,633
That type of stress is the type
of stress that constantly wears

39
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,699
on us.

40
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,266
And especially when we don't
have a lot of time to recover in

41
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,300
between stressful events, that's
where we start to feel the

42
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,599
effects even more.

43
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,933
Everybody experiences stress
a little bit differently.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,033
We all have different levels of
hardiness which is the amount of

45
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,433
stress that we can take on
before it starts to affect us.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,666
We have different levels of
resiliency which is how quickly

47
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,366
we can recover from stress
events to stress events.

48
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,465
And our experiences with stress,
whether it is good stress or bad

49
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,632
stress, affect how
we react to it.

50
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:52,800
We tend to classify stress
in three different degrees.

51
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,966
The acute stress is the typical
stress that you might feel.

52
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:00,766
It is the heart rate goes
up, you start to sweat.

53
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,866
You know, someone closing a door
or popping a balloon, it is an

54
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,000
immediate reaction that you have
but you start to calm down as

55
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,333
soon as the event goes away.

56
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,833
Episodic stress is repetitive
stress with little or no time to

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,966
recover in between.

58
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:21,033
That's where you start to feel
those long-term anxieties, that

59
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:24,198
burn that you feel when you
feel like you don't really calm

60
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,099
down completely.

61
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,400
That's because you're not giving
your body enough time to recover

62
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,166
from that event.

63
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,766
The worst degree of
stress is chronic stress.

64
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,133
This is where you are in an
enduring situation with no sense

65
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,166
of control.

66
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,666
Control is a common theme
that I'll talk about throughout

67
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:41,400
this talk.

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,466
Stress can have profound
effects on mental health.

69
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:50,033
You have the physical effects,
so I talked a little bit about

70
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,399
increased heart rate and
your body starting to sweat.

71
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:58,433
Especially if you have
underlying health conditions, it

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,933
can certainly aggravate them.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,066
It can also have effects on your
mental health, both in terms of

74
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,733
anxiety and depression.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,866
It can also have effects on your
cognitive ability while you're

76
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,333
doing the work while stressed.

77
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:16,065
I have mentioned that burnout
and turnover is a major topic in

78
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,433
cybersecurity and stress
contributes to that.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,399
I mentioned
depression and anxiety.

80
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:25,833
It can also lead to risky
behavior in acute situations or

81
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,233
even substance abuse.

82
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,266
There are a number of risk
factors that contribute to

83
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,133
stress or that stress can
aggravate some of these things

84
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,466
and they're very individual.

85
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,866
So, different people have
different levels of hardiness

86
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,300
and resiliency to these factors.

87
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,500
So, it really depends on your
own personal circumstances.

88
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:51,166
These factors can be external
to your work or internal to

89
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,133
your work.

90
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,966
For example, if you have
relationship problems, you could

91
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:57,600
be fighting with your spouse,
or if you could have internal

92
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,233
relationship problems to your
cybersecurity team where you're

93
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,100
not really melding as a
team and getting along well.

94
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,866
There are a number
of other factors.

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,566
The commonality across all of
these factors is that there is a

96
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:16,166
lack of control and that control
is what eats away at your hope

97
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,100
for being able to
achieve happiness.

98
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,266
Happiness is another
theme that I'll talk about.

99
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:27,633
Locus of control is our fancy
psych term for describing the

100
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,733
extent to which a person feels
that they have control over the

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,399
outcome in their lives.

102
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,233
This sense of control is
really critical for wellbeing.

103
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:42,599
So, I'll step away from talking
about stress and talk more about

104
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,266
what we need to be happy because
these things are related.

105
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,766
So, some of you may be
familiar with Maslow's hierarchy

106
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,733
of needs.

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,266
It is something that we
sometimes talk about in high

108
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:56,199
school or college psychology or
sometimes you might see it in a

109
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,866
business class.

110
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:02,199
And these are things that we
need in order to be happy and

111
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,500
healthy individuals.

112
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:07,732
We have our physiological needs,
our safety needs, on top of

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,833
that, love and belonging,
our esteem, and also

114
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,933
self-actualization, so, you
know, the pinnacle of

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,233
our happiness.

116
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,399
But not all of these
needs are built the same.

117
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:24,833
We have deficiency needs - there
we go - deficiency needs which

118
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,666
are our absolute
minimum requirements.

119
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,066
We can't think about anything
else until these needs are met.

120
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,265
If we're in poverty of any of
these, they basically trump all

121
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,366
other requirements.

122
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,000
If you don't have enough
food and water, it is really

123
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,066
difficult to think about
fulfilling any type of safety

124
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,799
need, let alone love and
belonging or any of our other

125
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,566
level of needs.

126
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,199
Once those deficiency needs are
met, we can start working on our

127
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,233
growth needs.

128
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,266
These are the needs that we
need in order to be happy.

129
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,166
And so, these ones, we're
constantly trying to achieve

130
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,266
more and more.

131
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,133
They're not basic requirements
like our deficiency needs.

132
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,366
Rather, they are things
that we're constantly trying

133
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:07,466
to achieve.

134
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,733
And once we get to that level of
self-actualization where we're

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,866
able to have those peak
experiences, that's where we

136
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,399
reach our level of happiness.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,033
So, let's talk about cyber.

138
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,699
I don't think I need to tell
anybody in this room that cyber

139
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:24,766
is hard.

140
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,899
It is extremely challenging,
it's exciting, there is always

141
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:29,899
something new.

142
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,500
And those are a lot of the
reasons why we are even in

143
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,166
this industry.

144
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,000
That's why we like doing cyber.

145
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,465
It's exciting and fun and
we want the challenge.

146
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,500
However, cyber is also complex.

147
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,899
It is extremely unpredictable
and is prone to failure.

148
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:49,566
You know, it's more than fifteen
years after patch Tuesday was

149
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,966
substantiated, but we still
hold our breath and cross

150
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,033
our fingers.

151
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,333
That should tell us something.

152
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,099
Cyber is an art, not a science,
and it is most definitely not at

153
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,566
an engineering level.

154
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:05,966
That lack of predictability eats
away at our sense of control.

155
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,500
We're certainly working
on making it more like an

156
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:11,633
engineering discipline, but
there's still so many things

157
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,066
that are unpredictable
due to the complexity of

158
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,532
our environment.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,733
That's contributing
a lot to our stress.

160
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,100
Cyber is also a very high
risk, high reward environment.

161
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:28,000
It is hard work and there is
equivalent stress to go with it.

162
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,332
Some of these are the
good types of stress.

163
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,566
We like challenges.

164
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,633
Challenges are fun.

165
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,500
That's why we do it.

166
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,566
The bad type of stress is that
frustration from a lack of

167
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:42,000
control due to all of the
things that make cyber so fun.

168
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,133
So, I mentioned that, you know,
I'm from the NSA and we're

169
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,966
interested in stress.

170
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:53,200
And a few years ago, my
colleague and I did a study of

171
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,933
stress in our
tactical cyber operators.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,466
And so, we looked at
operations that were across

173
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,433
four NSA locations.

174
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,299
We - I think we
studied 126 operators.

175
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:08,933
This was 361 cyber operations.

176
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:13,299
And it was no surprise to us,
but also very interesting that

177
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:16,799
we found that these operations
were very stressful.

178
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,966
They had the good
types of stress.

179
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,899
They were stressful because
they were challenging and our

180
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:25,899
operators were in that type of
job because they were drawn to

181
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,233
the challenge.

182
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,033
However, there was also
the bad type of stress.

183
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,833
There was a lot of fatigue
and frustration involved in

184
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,100
these operations.

185
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,733
What was interesting was that a
lot of the frustration, a lot of

186
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,199
that anxiety due to
lack of control, came from

187
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,966
external factors.

188
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,233
So, there were the normal, you
know, unpredictability things

189
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:52,433
that happened in the operations,
but they brought a lot of their

190
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,933
anxiety from home or other
aspects of their work into the

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,700
operation and that was inducing
some level of stress as well.

192
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:05,633
So, case in point, this is
an excerpt from one of the

193
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,299
participants from our study.

194
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:11,366
This is how they went
into the operation.

195
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,399
This is before the operation.

196
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:16,100
They were clearly frustrated.

197
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,166
Specifically, they were
irritated, stressed, and annoyed

198
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:23,366
at something but it wasn't
necessarily cyber yet.

199
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:29,299
I am happy to report that their
frustration level went down, way

200
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,600
down, after the operation
and they were successful in

201
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,833
the operation.

202
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,866
But this just goes to show how
much we carry with us whenever

203
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,600
we come into the
environment to do our work.

204
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:45,565
So, this is a good example where
they were successful and they

205
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,600
were able to bring themselves
back into themselves and

206
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,066
recenter themselves.

207
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,399
Is that necessarily the case
every time we bring something

208
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,166
into our work?

209
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,366
Our environment is a little
interesting and different as

210
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:04,600
well in the sense that our
operators take on these really

211
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,200
high risk, high
reward operations.

212
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,065
But they do that because they're
committed to the mission.

213
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:14,899
In some ways, they take that
almost to an extreme because

214
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,600
they know what's at stake.

215
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,133
They know that if they fail,
there could be a risk of loss of

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
life, property, or sovereignty.

217
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,632
That's a really heavy
responsibility to take on day to

218
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,433
day but they gladly do it
because they're so committed to

219
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,466
the mission.

220
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,899
However, if cyber is so
stressful and there's not much

221
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,166
we can do about the
unpredictability about that

222
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,599
environment, what are some
things that we can do to help

223
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,966
people who work in this
environment manage their stress

224
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:48,066
if we can't
necessarily remove it?

225
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:55,099
So, thinking back on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs, I started

226
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,566
thinking about, well, what
are some things that we need

227
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,266
as hackers?

228
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,199
What are our hacker
hierarchy of needs?

229
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,565
And we have a lot
of the same things.

230
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,933
We still have
physiological needs.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,566
We still have safety needs
and love and belonging.

232
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,066
We still have these
esteem needs, need our

233
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,466
self-actualization
in order to be happy.

234
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,100
We also have those deficiency
needs or the things that we need

235
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,899
to do our jobs.

236
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,966
We need equipment,
tools, and access.

237
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,799
If we don't have those things,
we can't start thinking about

238
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:25,733
anything else.

239
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,100
We don't care about the
authorities or policy if we

240
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,833
can't even, you know, put
our hands on a keyboard.

241
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:35,733
Once we have those authorities
and policies, do we have a team

242
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,766
that supports us?

243
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,799
Do we have an
organization that supports us?

244
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,399
That's just to do our jobs.

245
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:44,600
We're not even at the level
yet where we feel like we're

246
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,266
fulfilled or doing
what we think is right.

247
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,000
Once we start getting
into our esteem needs and

248
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,299
self-actualization, this is
where we can start talking about

249
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,266
what we need to be happy.

250
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,433
Reputation is something that's
very important to us because,

251
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,033
you know, we're a
meritocracy in some ways.

252
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,200
All you have to do is spend a
couple hours on Twitter to

253
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:07,933
see that.

254
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:13,200
However, you know, it's building
community in a positive way.

255
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:16,632
Having a mission that you
believe in, so we have that at

256
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,433
NSA, do your
organizations have that?

257
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,733
But that mission is really
what's driving all of us to do

258
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,266
the type of work that we do and
to take on the risks that we do

259
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,000
in order to achieve something
greater than just ourselves.

260
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:42,200
I talked a bit about what is
stress and why cybersecurity in

261
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,565
particular is stressful.

262
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:47,766
We, you know, explored a bit
about what our needs are, both

263
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:52,033
as a human and also as a hacker.

264
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,666
But what are some things
that we can do in order to

265
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,500
manage stress?

266
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,600
I haven't gotten to
the solution space yet.

267
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,733
How do we get from where we are
now to where we want to be in

268
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,466
the future?

269
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,766
This is where hope comes in.

270
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,533
Hope is the belief in
your ability to control

271
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,166
your circumstances.

272
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,599
It is a way of reclaiming
control in an environment that

273
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:20,000
is inherently
complex and unpredictable.

274
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:26,100
Hope is a really interesting
construct that has a lot of, you

275
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:31,100
know, we think of it as a fuzzy
term but it is actually a very

276
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,933
mature psychological construct.

277
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:37,133
And hope is something that you
can build in your organization

278
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
and change the culture to
help your people manage their

279
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,033
stress better.

280
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,166
To build hope in an
organization, you have to have

281
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,965
clear, shared goals, and a way
of having shared goals is to

282
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,833
allow people to contribute to
the building of those goals.

283
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,632
Taking input from the people who
do the work but then also giving

284
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,200
them agency to affect those
goals helps them regain control

285
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:06,033
in an environment
that is inherently complex

286
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,066
and unpredictable.

287
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:13,766
Also, by valuing work/life
balance, as an organization,

288
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,466
you're showing the people who
are doing the work for you, who

289
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:20,066
are helping you achieve your
goals, that you care about them.

290
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,466
It also helps them manage all
of that stress that they're

291
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,200
bringing into their work so
that they can do better work.

292
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,299
Hope takes time.

293
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,866
I mentioned culture a few
times and culture doesn't

294
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,566
change overnight.

295
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,933
It is something that's very
important, it is something that

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,766
you can do over time, but what's
something that we can do now?

297
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,333
What's something that takes less
time to achieve because we're

298
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,600
all stressed and we can't wait
months or years in order to

299
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,366
change our
organizational culture.

300
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,899
Mindfulness is a way of
bringing attention to yourself

301
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,533
and the present.

302
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,100
It is a really useful
methodology for centering and

303
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,000
managing stress.

304
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:05,866
One technique in mindfulness
that I really like is called

305
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,866
three mindful breaths.

306
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,933
This is something that helps you
calm your thoughts and come back

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
into focus through breathing.

308
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:17,500
It is also a really useful
technique for calming your body

309
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,166
through controlled
physical movement.

310
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:22,433
We tend to carry a lot of
stress and a lot of tension in

311
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,600
our body.

312
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,933
Simply by taking a deep breath
and letting it go, you release a

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,399
lot of that tension and it helps
you come back into the present.

314
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,533
Also, I really like this
technique because I'm a

315
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,166
scientist and there's a lot
of research that shows that

316
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:43,333
mindfulness specifically has
long-term effects on cognition

317
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,533
and mental health, so not only
are you going to perform better,

318
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,266
you're just simply
going to feel better.

319
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,866
These are very easy
to learn techniques.

320
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,100
There are a lot of resources
online and there are other types

321
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,033
of training or coaching
that you can get.

322
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,000
But it is still something
that you need to practice.

323
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,933
I actually didn't realize this
right away because I practice

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
yoga, and so I'm
familiar with meditation and

325
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,533
breathing techniques.

326
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:11,200
But it took a friend in crisis
for me to realize that not

327
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:15,433
everybody has these skills
already and that we still need

328
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,032
something that we can take back
with us and use immediately.

329
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,466
This is where sensory
centering comes in.

330
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,098
This is probably the most
successful technique that I

331
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:28,032
know about.

332
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:31,099
I like this technique because
not only is it something that

333
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,700
you can do for yourself right
now, this is something that you

334
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,633
can guide a colleague
through right now.

335
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,200
It is a very entry level
grounding technique.

336
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:44,332
If you happened to stop by the
NSA booth this week, you may

337
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,733
have picked up one of these
boxes and wondered what it was.

338
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,466
It has the sensory
centering technique on it.

339
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,632
Really, you don't even
have to go in order.

340
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,299
What it does, it helps you focus
on specific senses and it helps

341
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:04,099
reduce all of the noise that may
be going on if you're in some

342
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,832
type of spiraling crisis.

343
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,333
What are five things
that you can see?

344
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,299
What are four
things you can touch?

345
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:18,366
Three things you can hear?

346
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,433
Two things you can smell?

347
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,033
One thing you can taste.

348
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,933
By taking the time to focus on
those individual senses, it

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,066
makes it much easier to forget
about all of the noise that is

350
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,766
going on in your head and
in your body and in your

351
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,533
environment so that you can come
back to your senses and have

352
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,599
a conversation.

353
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:45,500
However, if you or someone you
know is in a mental health

354
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,900
crisis, if you're afraid that
someone is going to hurt

355
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:51,599
themselves or others,
immediately call 911.

356
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,033
I can't stress this enough.

357
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,332
We try to fix problems
that we need help fixing.

358
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,166
However, if you need to talk to
someone, there's a new mental

359
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:05,299
health crisis emergency
line, 711, or you can call

360
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,633
1-800-273-TALK to
talk to someone.

361
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,633
If the phone isn't your thing,
you can also Tweet @273talk.

362
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,766
So, I gave you some ideas about
techniques that you can take

363
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,900
back with you.

364
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:25,065
But you might be interested in
knowing some of the things that

365
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,099
we're doing at NSA to help
our workforce manage stress.

366
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,899
We have put a lot of effort into
developing employee assistance

367
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,733
and wellness services
for that purpose.

368
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,566
We have a civilian fitness
program that allows people to

369
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,599
work out on duty time.

370
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,133
We have a mindfulness and
meditation program that teaches

371
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,299
some of these techniques so that
people are armed with their

372
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:52,400
ability to you know, breathe
properly or meditation.

373
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,666
There are also great
team building exercises.

374
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,065
Probably my favorite, it
is our mentoring program.

375
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,766
We have a great army of mentors.

376
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,700
This is not just career advice.

377
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:08,200
This is, you know, you're having
a bad day, you don't know how to

378
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:14,000
manage an interpersonal conflict
or a work conflict, you need

379
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,266
somebody to talk to, and
sometimes you just need a friend

380
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,299
to talk to.

381
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:20,599
We're in a unique environment
where sometimes we work on

382
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,366
things that we can't talk to
friends external to the agency

383
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,799
about or spouses; it is nice to
have a friend that understands

384
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:29,133
our unique environment.

385
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,866
It is not just NSA's
super-secret-squirrel stuff.

386
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,099
Even in your own organizations
where you might have friends who

387
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,299
aren't in cybersecurity who
don't understand why that

388
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,833
challenge that you are
struggling with matters.

389
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,333
Well, it is just a computer,
can't you just turn it on and

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,366
turn it off again?

391
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,799
But most of all, what I like
about the mentoring program, and

392
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,766
I have personal experience with
this, is sometimes you need

393
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:58,033
somebody to remind you that
work/life balance is important.

394
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:01,265
And sometimes we think of
work/life balance as a selfish

395
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,799
thing but I hope I have helped
you realize that work/life

396
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:09,366
balance is important and it can
help you do a better job, it can

397
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,700
help your work.

398
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:15,766
Because we bring so much into
work with us, helping to manage

399
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,500
that balance between our
personal lives and work can help

400
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,700
us to manage our stress
better and then also just be

401
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:23,566
better hackers.

402
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,000
So, let's summarize things
that you can take away with you

403
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,299
right now.

404
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:34,533
For individuals and teams,
practice mindfulness.

405
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,265
There are resources online.

406
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,466
They make great team
building exercises.

407
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:43,765
There is also the sensory
centering technique.

408
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,766
Also just check in
with each other.

409
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,066
Be that buddy.

410
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,866
If someone is running hot one
day, you know, just tell them to

411
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,033
take a break.

412
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:52,799
They need that.

413
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:57,265
For organizations, empower
your workforce and consider

414
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,433
instilling hope as
part of your culture.

415
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,700
Value that work/life balance
because not only does it show

416
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:08,633
your employees that you care
about them, it has long-term

417
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,233
benefits for your organization
because you are empowering them

418
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,466
to manage their stress and
to do better work for you.

419
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:20,233
And my message to the
community is be kind and lift

420
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,900
each other up.

421
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,966
Remember, we're all
in this together.

422
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,566
Cybersecurity is a team effort.

423
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:31,066
With a whole of society
approach, we can protect our

424
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:35,066
networks, secure our systems,
and look out for each other.

425
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:39,733
We all want to be happy hackers;
happy hackers are better

426
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,933
at security.

427
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,766
Thank you.

428
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,366
So, I wanted to leave a
lot of time for questions.

429
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:57,400
I often talk about this subject
and the last time I talked about

430
00:22:57,466 --> 00:23:00,866
it I think I had twenty minutes
of questions on stage and about

431
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,799
an hour and a half of
questions off stage.

432
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:07,833
So, of course, Neil, you
are the first question.

433
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,433
>> AUDIENCE: I'll defer to
someone else if someone -

434
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,000
of course, I can talk
to you at work too.

435
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,299
>> CELESTE PAUL: No, please.

436
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,066
>> AUDIENCE: I remember the
original that work you did on

437
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,033
stress and operators.

438
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,765
I have a vague recollection
that you recommended to the

439
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,866
organization involved,
some specific steps.

440
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:24,966
>> CELESTE PAUL: Yes.

441
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,265
>> AUDIENCE: I don't
remember what those were.

442
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,599
>> CELESTE PAUL: So, we were
really concerned with tactical

443
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,200
operations, and by that I mean
these are hands on keyboards.

444
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:36,433
So, these were not necessarily
op center, you know, watch

445
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,166
center operators, but these
were maybe red team, blue team

446
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:45,866
operators where you had set
operational plans, you had

447
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,500
specific tools and techniques
that you were using, you had to

448
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,966
get in and get out because
you were on a timeline.

449
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,366
What's interesting is that
whenever - from a performance

450
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,833
perspective, and I'm
going to start getting a little

451
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,566
sciencey here.

452
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:04,533
I'll try to keep it down.

453
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,832
From a performance perspective,
we don't - we have a hard time

454
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,000
realizing how tired we are and
when our performance starts

455
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,366
to decline.

456
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:17,900
So, we think we can run much
further than we actually can

457
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:20,733
before our cognitive
abilities start to decline.

458
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:25,900
So, for the operations that we
studied, the average op length

459
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,166
was five-ish
hours plus or minus.

460
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:33,033
That's a long time if you think
about an eight hour workday and

461
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:38,599
most of that is hands on
keyboard doing things, you are

462
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:42,366
paying attention, you are trying
not to make any mistakes, if you

463
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,866
make a mistake you might blow
the whole op, that's a lot.

464
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:51,666
And so, we had recommended to
the organization to watch out

465
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:55,566
for that timeline because we
wanted to make sure that they

466
00:24:55,633 --> 00:25:00,433
realized that anything over that
amount of time, you start to see

467
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,799
cognitive decline, but you
also see increases in fatigue

468
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:05,666
and frustration.

469
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:11,833
And we didn't study the
operational outcome, but we

470
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,266
studied how people felt
about the outcome and what's

471
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,666
interesting about that is people
often feel like they did worse

472
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,733
than they actually did.

473
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,333
So, an op might be successful
but if it didn't go perfectly as

474
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,033
planned, you personally might
feel like you failed because you

475
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,533
made some type of mistake
that could have been avoided.

476
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,366
By helping people manage their
own fatigue because sometimes it

477
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:36,333
takes a moment to come back into
yourself to realize how tired

478
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,000
you really are, we can lift each
other up, we can help each other

479
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,866
do better just to
prevent those mistakes.

480
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,633
Any other questions?

481
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,966
Yes, ma'am?

482
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,033
>> AUDIENCE:
Hi. I work for Microsoft Azure.

483
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:56,633
I am a PM Director there.

484
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,833
So, my question - thank you for
sharing, to raise this topic and

485
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,133
sharing with us.

486
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,333
My question is do you have best
practices in measuring the

487
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,266
stress level, the healthiness of
your workforce of the ops, and

488
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:14,500
the effectiveness of the
methodologies, the practices

489
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:19,133
that you do to either help them
better or to give them really

490
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,799
help? Thanks.

491
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,066
>> CELESTE PAUL:
That's a great question.

492
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,900
So, the question was do we have
any methodologies for studying

493
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:29,199
stress and then have we been
able to measure the effects of

494
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,000
certain types of mitigations?

495
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,099
Yeah.

496
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:38,099
So, we actually developed a
methodology for studying stress.

497
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,366
Part of that was because we
couldn't find any methodologies

498
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,599
that were specific to the type
of environment that we were

499
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,566
interested in.

500
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:49,466
So, we wanted to look at
specific activities rather than

501
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,832
long-term op center fatigue
which is a different type

502
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,799
of fatigue.

503
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:56,066
We wanted to make sure we
captured - we were studying the

504
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:56,966
right thing.

505
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,333
This survey instrument is
called the Cyber Operation

506
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,566
Stress Survey.

507
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:05,566
It is something that we have
published and is available on

508
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:11,066
NSA.gov or if you Google any of
these terms with my name, it

509
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,799
will probably pop up somewhere.

510
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,133
That's something that we were
able to use across multiple

511
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,500
studies, so I talked about four
studies of - and at different

512
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:26,700
NSA locations, and we
were able to use that.

513
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:33,366
The other question was, have
we been able to measure the

514
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,333
effectiveness of some
of these techniques?

515
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,433
So, I personally have not
done research in that area.

516
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,933
I made recommendations and have
been thinking about other types

517
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,166
of techniques that we can
integrate and introduce into

518
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:48,133
our environment.

519
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,366
I do have a colleague who has
been working on mindfulness and

520
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:55,299
he's the one who told me about
the scientific underpinnings of

521
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:59,766
mindfulness and the cognitive
benefits, not just the mental

522
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:03,066
health benefits of mindfulness
and meditation techniques.

523
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,666
So, there is
science behind that.

524
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:09,233
I mentioned hope and got a
little wishy-washy on hope as a

525
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,799
psyche construct.

526
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:15,299
There is a lot of work on hope
from the scientific perspective

527
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:19,666
and its effect on organizations
and individuals as well.

528
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,599
And so, those are different
types of research studies that

529
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,000
you could look up.

530
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,099
Thank you.

531
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,599
Yes, ma'am?

532
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,899
>> AUDIENCE: So,
Molly from Raytheon.

533
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:33,832
My question is did your research
show differences between teams

534
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,666
that were localized in one place
or perhaps remote and more - I

535
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:43,033
can't think of the right word,
but separate from one another?

536
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,166
Yes.

537
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:48,066
>> CELESTE PAUL: So, all of the
operators that we studied were

538
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,666
local to each other.

539
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:54,066
They tend to work in small
teams and not remotely.

540
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,566
So, I don't really have an
answer to that question.

541
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,233
Any other questions?

542
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,200
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

543
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:08,299
We are handing out some of these
boxes if you would like to take

544
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:09,466
one home with you.

545
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,799
Take a couple
home for your team.

546
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:15,566
I believe the slides will be
available online if you wanted

547
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:20,233
to reference any of the
figures that I mentioned today.

548
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,066
So, thank you.
