00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,762
(bright upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,600
- We have a security mindset.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
We think about systems in terms
of adversaries and threats

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,207
and vulnerabilities
and security solutions.

5
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:16,880
And whether it is a system like Facebook,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,439
a system like a computer,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,341
or a system like our democracy,

8
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,484
they have the kind of moving components

9
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:26,764
that I think we have unique insight into.

10
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:28,880
Once we figure that out,

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
the question is what do we do with it.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,759
Do we influence policy,

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,463
do we go work on congressional staffs

14
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,130
in government agencies.

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,491
Broadly, I want to see
us engage in policy.

16
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,420
We just need to learn to communicate

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,269
what we do to an audience of lay people.

18
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,436
