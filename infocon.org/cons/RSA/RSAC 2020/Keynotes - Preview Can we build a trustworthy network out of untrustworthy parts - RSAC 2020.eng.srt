2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,580
- The internet was invented to answer

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,840
a very specific question, can you build

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,120
a reliable network out
of unreliable parts?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,479
The answer turns out to be, yes.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,630
There's a similar question
that would be great

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,720
if we could answer, can
we build a trustworthy

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,310
network out of untrustworthy parts?

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,860
And I don't know if the
answer is yes or not.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,340
Because we are gonna be living in a world

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,080
of untrustworthy parts and they might

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,519
come from China, they might
come from another country,

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,458
the might be Swiss crypto equipment.

14
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,940
(laughing)

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,820
And yet we have to somehow
get trustworthiness

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,540
out of that mishmash and I think

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,269
that's a research question that is on a

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,450
Maja/DARPA funding level.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,033
