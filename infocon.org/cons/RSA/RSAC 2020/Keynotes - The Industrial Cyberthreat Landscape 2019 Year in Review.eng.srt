1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:11,033
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Robert Lee.

2
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:19,799
>> ROBERT LEE: Good
morning, everyone.

3
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:20,899
Thanks for joining me.

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,366
My name is Robert Lee.

5
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,966
I'm the CEO and
cofounder over at Dragos.

6
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,866
We're a technology and
services company focused

7
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,166
on the industrial world.

8
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:32,466
So that's what my talk is
about, industrial world,

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,799
and what we have in our
community and really

10
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:37,100
looking at the different
challenges that we face

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,166
when we talk about the
different types of

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,032
industrial
infrastructures.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
My talk is going to be
going into not only the

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,532
cyberthreats that we saw
last year specifically to

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,500
industrial, but also the
lessons we learned, some

16
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,766
instant response cases,
things about new

17
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,600
vulnerabilities, lessons
learned that hopefully

18
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,099
will help you guide
your investments, your

19
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,532
resources, your effort and
time in this next year,

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,833
because going after
industrial security and

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,000
doing it well
is worth doing.

22
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:06,066
When we look at that
industrial world, what I

23
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,966
want to highlight is it's
not what we typically

24
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,933
think it is.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,400
I see a lot of folks who
think utilities and oil

26
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,732
and gas, and those are
really, really important

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,466
parts of our industrial
infrastructure, but it

28
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,166
really is everything,
building automation

29
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,766
systems and data
centers, rail, water.

30
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,633
Everything around us has
some element of physics

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,500
with it, and that's really
what we're talking about

32
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,599
is all that IT stuff
plus the physics of what

33
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,166
we're working with.

34
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,799
But with our industrial
world, we do have some

35
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:34,666
unique challenges.

36
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,566
I want to bring us all up
to speed right before we

37
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,500
get into all the actual
key points of the talk.

38
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,866
So, when we started out
and we wanted to look at

39
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,433
the industrial world, I
want to start off with a

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,099
little story we used
to tell people on the

41
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,133
intelligence side
of the house.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,700
When I first started my
career, I started off in

43
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,633
the Air Force, but spent
most of my time at the

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
National Security Agency
working on and looking at

45
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,599
industrial threats,
targeting Industrial

46
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:00,433
Control Systems or ICS, or
operations technology, not IoT.

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,799
I see a couple of
you doing that.

48
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:02,533
It's all IoT.

49
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,533
Stop saying that.

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,700
The moment we're comparing
Alexa to a gas turbine,

51
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,533
we're all going to die.

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,466
It's different
infrastructure.

53
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:13,232
But when we look at that
old intel story, it was

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,400
this idea of a man
underneath a light looking

55
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:17,699
for his car keys.

56
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,933
Pitch black everywhere,
light shining down

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,300
brightly on him, looking
and looking and looking

58
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,433
for his car keys, and a
police officer walks up

59
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,266
and says how
can I help you?

60
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,133
He says I'm looking
for my car keys.

61
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,000
So the police officer starts
looking around, helping him.

62
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,900
Five minutes go by, 10
minutes go by, starting to

63
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,233
get really frustrated.

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,366
The police officer says
where did you lose your keys?

65
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,366
The guy says in the
alley over there.

66
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,666
He says why are
we looking here?

67
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, this is
where I can see.

68
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,333
That, in of itself, is
a problem for a lot of

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,266
security, but it's
especially potent in

70
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,099
industrial security.

71
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,466
When we think about the
industrial threats over

72
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,565
the years, we hear all
these stories pop up,

73
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,266
where it's like, oh, well,
it was just one thing over

74
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,033
here, or there's not a lot
of industrial threats, and

75
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,433
there's not a lot of
different challenges

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,333
we're dealing with.

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,566
But then you ask companies
so what are you doing in

78
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:05,699
your industrial
environments?

79
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,465
Oh, well, nothing.

80
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,065
How would you see it then?

81
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,800
In a lot of ways,
we effectively have

82
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,533
Schrodinger's ICS
around the world.

83
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,232
We're not looking inside
the box to see that

84
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
everything is going well.

85
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,466
And the challenge for a
lot of our organizations

86
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,232
is that our infrastructure
is changing.

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,866
And we hear a lot of
different words get thrown

88
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,198
out, industry 4.0, digital
transformation, whatever

89
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,366
terms you want to use.

90
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,233
I would caution against
IT/OT convergence.

91
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
I see a lot of that,
like IT/OT convergence.

92
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,033
Actually, that happened
like a decade ago.

93
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,965
We already have Windows systems
in industrial environments.

94
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,399
That's not the convergence
that's taking place.

95
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,699
Largely, the convergence
now is around culture and

96
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,533
figuring out how
to get ahead of it.

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,299
But our infrastructure is
becoming hyperconnected

98
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,433
and we're seeing more
homogeneous infrastructure.

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,066
Instead of a substation in
one part of the country

100
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,099
being completely different
than the substation in

101
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,366
another part of the
country, we are going more

102
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:00,000
towards common operating
platforms, and that is

103
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,533
increasing the ability for
adversaries to get scale

104
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,433
in what they do.

105
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,900
So at the same time that
we're becoming hyper

106
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,966
connected and starting
to have more common

107
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,433
infrastructure, we are
also seeing threats that

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,300
are learning
from each other.

109
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,566
And I'll be able to talk
about that today as well.

110
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,766
But in our industrial
world, the security has to

111
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,933
be different.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,933
So one of the things I see
a lot of organizations

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,266
make mistakes on is they
effectively copy and paste their

114
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,933
IT security controls into
their operations environment.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,233
Effectively, whatever
doesn't break the system,

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
they feel comfortable
bringing over.

117
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,699
But that's not actually
how you reduce risk.

118
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:36,633
It doesn't necessarily mean
that that's the right control.

119
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,300
When we look at operations
technology security, a lot

120
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,832
of the things that you be
right-minded to walk into

121
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,399
an organization and
recommend don't really

122
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,766
give you the same
level of value.

123
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,699
A great example
is antivirus.

124
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:53,300
Not saying that antivirus
is bad, but when you go

125
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,666
into an operations
environment, maybe a

126
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,966
distributed control
system at a plant, like a

127
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,333
refinery, you look and
there's the nice little

128
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,300
icon running of the
antivirus, and you're like

129
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,500
it feels good.

130
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,599
But then you open it up
and you realize that

131
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,332
according to the vendor
warranty, they had to

132
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,399
exclude all of the files and
folder paths on that system.

133
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,633
So the light is on, the
icon is blinking, but it's

134
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,399
literally doing
nothing on that system.

135
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:17,066
And the reality is not that
everybody is jerks about this.

136
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,066
It's that software was created
with IT threats in mind.

137
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,532
So the stuff we do in
operations ends up looking

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,433
like an IT threat.

139
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,833
If you just ran the
antivirus in that way, you

140
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,699
would absolutely
bring the plant down.

141
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,699
I have responded to more
attacks on infrastructure

142
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,199
that has led to outages by
IT than I have ever dealt

143
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,166
with with Russia, China,
and Iran combined.

144
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,699
So we do have to be careful
in how we approach this.

145
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,466
Even things like
vulnerability patching.

146
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,899
If you walked in and said
we're going to address our

147
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:48,433
vulnerabilities, nobody
in their right mind would

148
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,399
tell you not to patch.

149
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,833
I'll be the guy.

150
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,000
You necessarily don't want
to go around patching all

151
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:54,933
your infrastructure.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,033
We know it from a risk
perspective of the

153
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,166
challenges that can be in
terms of operations and

154
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,300
patching high availability
equipment, but there's

155
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,133
actually another
reason to it.

156
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,833
It's the fact that a
significant portion of

157
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,166
vulnerabilities
are meaningless.

158
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,133
There are a lot of
vulnerabilities that

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
people have found on
industrial equipment that

160
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,800
sound good that aren't
weaponizable or usable by

161
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,566
adversaries to do
anything that is harmful.

162
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:19,133
We found that well over
half of the industrial

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,800
vulnerabilities
released were useless.

164
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,000
So we went through and
reverse engineered and

165
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,532
looked at every single
vulnerability and found

166
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,033
that more than half of
them added absolutely zero

167
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,333
risk compared to what was
already natively available

168
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,233
on the system in
the first place.

169
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,100
So, again, it's
not don't patch.

170
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,866
I can already see the RSA
hashtags now is like the

171
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,800
operations people go
to IT and say Rob Lee

172
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:42,466
said don't patch.

173
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,633
No, that's not
the takeaway.

174
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,466
But patch wisely.

175
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,466
Figure out which ones
actually introduce risk.

176
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,633
And to do that, it's not
going to be based on a CVS.

177
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,966
It's not going to
be based on a score.

178
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,366
It's going to be based on
getting to know your operations.

179
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,766
It's going to be based
on getting to know your

180
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,366
people and understanding
what the mission really is.

181
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,599
And our threats are
ultimately different as well.

182
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,533
That's why we have to take a
different focus on security.

183
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,766
Why does OT security need
to be treated differently?

184
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,966
Different mission,
different systems,

185
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,666
different purpose that
we're actually trying to

186
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:12,933
achieve, and
different threats.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So if you've got all these
different things, then we

188
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,532
shouldn't assume the
security controls are

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,133
going to be the same.

190
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,733
Years ago, the late Mike
Asante and I wrote a paper

191
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,966
titled the ICS Cyber Kill
Chain, and all we were

192
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:26,266
trying to say is all of
the steps and things that

193
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,600
you think about in an
enterprise or IT network,

194
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,199
those are important, but
it's just stage one of

195
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,366
causing an attack in an
industrial environment.

196
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,566
If you really want to
go forward and cause an

197
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,032
attack that's going to
manipulate the physical

198
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,800
process or have some sort
of actual known impact,

199
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:47,099
not just spring in map in
the environment and hoping

200
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,266
that something happens,
but actually doing a high

201
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,333
confidence attack.

202
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,699
You're going to have to
understand the physics of

203
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,500
that system, the
engineering of it, the

204
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,599
understanding of
everything outside of just

205
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,166
the IT stuff.

206
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,600
A lot of the stage one
that we track or think

207
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,399
about is only if we see
them going after the types

208
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,333
of systems like
data historians or

209
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,333
human-machine interfaces
or engineering documents,

210
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,000
the type of stuff that is
going to be useful for

211
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,032
building a stage two.

212
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,833
We start thinking about
that stage two, it also

213
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,966
brings me a lot of
confidence because I

214
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,966
always hear how industrial
security is so far behind

215
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,899
and how we're so screwed.

216
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,899
We as a defender community
needs therapy sometimes.

217
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,000
We start going, oh my
gosh, the adversary has

218
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,433
the upper hand all the
time and we're never going

219
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,799
to get this right.

220
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,765
Well, from a kill chain
perspective, I love it

221
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,265
because it actually
shows that industrial

222
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,399
environments, there's more
steps that an adversary

223
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,533
has to achieve to do the
types of things that we

224
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
care about most.

225
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:45,466
That gives us an
opportunity and time to

226
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,166
think about how we're
going to analyze and work

227
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,032
through that to make sure
that we keep the lights

228
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,799
on, that we keep the
refinery active, that we

229
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,533
keep our
manufacturing secure.

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
So we can do it.

231
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,899
But there are
some scary cases.

232
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,466
I want to go over one,
highlight one that

233
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,133
happened in 2017 as we
lead into this talk about

234
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,933
the year in
review for 2019.

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,266
Some of you might be
familiar with this.

236
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,299
Unfortunately, quite a bit
of the information that is

237
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,766
public about it
is incorrect.

238
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,333
There's a lot of folks who
wanted to talk about the

239
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,633
incident without having
any familiarity with the

240
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,899
threat or the incident, so it
drove a lot of misreporting.

241
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,566
It wasn't the journalists
doing a bad mistake.

242
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,433
It was our own community
maybe talking a little

243
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,533
bit, a little bit active.

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,799
Back in 2017 in a
petrochemical facility

245
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,966
that was not Saudi Aramco,
that was actually one of

246
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,833
the big things that Iran
was like Saudi Aramco was

247
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,333
attacked by Iran.

248
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,000
Both those statements
are incorrect.

249
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,933
But there was a
petrochemical facility in

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,666
Saudi Arabia that
was attacked.

251
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:42,733
But, actually, it was
compromised back in 2014.

252
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,699
In 2014, the adversary,
we tracked them as an

253
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,033
adversary called Xenotime.

254
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,799
The adversary broke into
that facility, bypassed

255
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,433
the SMS-based two-factor
that they were using, went

256
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,299
straight through the
enterprise networks, blew

257
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,199
through the IT security
controls they were doing,

258
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,033
and went directly
for the plants.

259
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,733
They didn't stop.

260
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,165
They didn't do
anything else.

261
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,933
They went directly for
the safety system and the

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,266
engineering workstation
around that.

263
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,100
So when you think about
different types of

264
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,466
industrial equipment,
we do have, in many

265
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,866
environments, a type of
system called an SIS or

266
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,665
safety instrumented system.

267
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:20,632
It is a purpose-built
system specifically

268
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,633
implemented and integrated
into that physical process.

269
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,200
So it's very, very unique.

270
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:29,199
Its only purpose in life
is to prevent death at

271
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:29,866
that facility.

272
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,100
Not protect the equipment.

273
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,799
That would be
protection systems.

274
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,033
Not to keep the plant running
if something goes wrong.

275
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,799
Its only actual purpose is
that if everything else is

276
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,366
going wrong, it can shut
down the plant in such a

277
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,133
way that people don't die.

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,666
That's it.

279
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,132
And this adversary
beelined right for it.

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,666
The adversary ended up
identifying what the

281
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,599
system was, figuring out
what they could about it,

282
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,933
and then left for a
little over two years.

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,733
It is our assessment that
in that time they were

284
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,699
going and they had
eventually acquired a

285
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:03,799
physical copy and a
physical access to a range

286
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,133
or environment that had
that type of equipment and

287
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,666
they went and developed
a capability known as

288
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,899
Trisis, and they came back
in 2017 and they deployed

289
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,399
it against this
petrochemical facility.

290
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,566
It was the first time ever
that we had a cyberattack

291
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,000
intentionally designed
to kill people.

292
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,966
Luckily, the
adversary messed up.

293
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,266
It wasn't because the
system was so resilient or

294
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,433
the security of the safety
system was so awesome.

295
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,700
That's not what happened.

296
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,233
What happened is your
adversaries are human,

297
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,033
too, and they made a small
coding error that ended up

298
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,666
tripping the safety system
or bringing it down, but

299
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,399
it didn't have the
intended effect of

300
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,766
removing the logic and
keeping it up while you

301
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,299
could do an attack on the
environment that would

302
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,233
harm people.

303
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,100
The operators and
engineers saw that and

304
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,766
said, hey, our safety
system tripped.

305
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,699
So let's call the vendor.

306
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:49,833
Let's figure this out.

307
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,700
And as they were all
talking, they came to the

308
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:55,833
conclusion, well, maybe
it's just a maintenance issue.

309
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,133
Getting root cause
analysis of really

310
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,966
understanding what goes
wrong in our environments

311
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,100
is as important as
detection because it's

312
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
going to guide the way
that we interact and it's

313
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:08,399
going to guide the way in
who gets brought into the case.

314
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,200
Engineering determined
that it was just a

315
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:12,033
maintenance thing,
advised by the vendor.

316
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,600
IT security folks
eventually got involved.

317
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,666
The IT security folks with
the wrong training, wrong

318
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,399
tooling looked at it
and said I don't think

319
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,766
anything is happening.

320
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,033
They went back
into production.

321
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,533
The adversary got
a second chance.

322
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,466
We definitely don't want
the adversaries to have a

323
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:27,799
second chance.

324
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,533
But they came back.

325
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,100
They found out the error,
one of the errors in the

326
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,366
software, the Trisis
software they deployed.

327
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,799
They patched it,
redeployed it, and it failed.

328
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,066
See?

329
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,533
Patching doesn't even
work for the adversaries.

330
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,466
They ended up patching the
safety system, the safety

331
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:47,600
system malware, but they
patched the wrong thing.

332
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:52,366
Still, as humans, as
people, they still messed

333
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,000
up on their own
malicious software.

334
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,399
So they caused the safety
system to trip again.

335
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,899
This time the engineering
folks at that company said

336
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,133
something is obviously
wrong, and we're getting

337
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,566
bad advice from
everybody else.

338
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,566
They ended up having two
responders, I think a

339
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,000
couple other people got
involved as well from the

340
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,000
company, end up coming
and helping them.

341
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,500
Unlike what was reported,
that wasn't instance

342
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:15,500
response firms.

343
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:16,733
That was Saudi Aramco.

344
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,500
It was actually Saudi
Aramco wasn't the victim.

345
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,066
They were the
incident responders.

346
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,066
The folks over there ended
up going to the plants,

347
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,299
helping out their
neighbors and their community.

348
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,899
After the fact, firms
like Mine and FireEye and

349
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,966
others got involved,
analyzed what we could,

350
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,566
talk about the threat,
help tell the bigger picture.

351
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:37,266
But a lot of credit goes
not to the people here,

352
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,299
but to the folks there
that actually did it in

353
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:40,500
their community.

354
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,966
And that's something
powerful, too, about our

355
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,399
industrial world is taking
care of our community.

356
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:45,966
It's our infrastructure.

357
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,333
There's something personal
about that that we should

358
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,266
all be excited about.

359
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,933
But we're dealing with
threats that are actually

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,766
getting more aggressive
and are actually going

361
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,665
after and harming people.

362
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,366
This isn't just about
intellectual property

363
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,799
theft, though that is
important, too, and more

364
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,665
likely to be in your
manufacturing lines than

365
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,366
in your email server, but
we're talking about safety

366
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,399
and environmental impact
and things that matter

367
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:07,633
to our communities.

368
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,066
That is a scary story, so
I always have this right

369
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,766
after the fact almost as
like eye therapy afterwards.

370
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,466
Defense is doable.

371
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,600
We talked about
some bad things.

372
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,399
We talked about some
things we saw this past year.

373
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,899
But what I want everybody
to remember is our

374
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:24,500
infrastructure is way
better than people give

375
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:25,666
it credit for.

376
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,632
I always see somebody on
social media go find a

377
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,566
vulnerability or be able
to phish an email exchange

378
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,399
server or something in a
power utility and they go,

379
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:38,500
ah-ha, you can
bring down the grid.

380
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,433
There is not one grid.

381
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,166
Let's get that
through our minds.

382
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:45,465
And also, we have highly,
highly safe and

383
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,399
reliable infrastructure.

384
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,666
It's not because things
are so bad today that

385
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:50,866
we're doing security.

386
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,766
It's because the threats
are getting really

387
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,100
aggressive and more
numerous and our

388
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,200
industry is changing.

389
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:59,132
Going back to that second
slide that I showed.

390
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,399
The understanding is we're
trying to get ahead of

391
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,466
this issue because we want
to maintain the safe and

392
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,899
reliable operations
that we see around the

393
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,433
community and have
visibility into what

394
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,700
the problem is.

395
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,799
But it's not worth running
out and going, oh my gosh,

396
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,600
these folks are doing
so many bad things.

397
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,433
Actually, our asset owners
do way more than they

398
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,233
publicize because they
don't want to tell people

399
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,000
what their actual
defenses are.

400
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,966
So we do need to have a
little bit of credit for

401
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,399
what they are actually
doing in these environments.

402
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,200
So for the rest of the
talk what I'm going to

403
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:27,632
talk about is our year in
review reports and all the

404
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,866
different insights
that we have from them.

405
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:30,933
These just launched.

406
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,866
We do them every year
just as a thing to give

407
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,000
to the community.

408
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,500
It's got one of those
capture banners and you

409
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,500
can click skip.

410
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:37,466
I don't need your email.

411
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,333
Just go read reports
and actually understand

412
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,500
what we're seeing.

413
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,000
For years, we've talked in
abstract about threats and

414
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,399
vulnerabilities and
similar, so this was our

415
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:49,200
contribution to say here
is the actual data.

416
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,299
It was inspired like
the M-Trend reports.

417
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,500
It was inspired by the
Verizon DBIR reports.

418
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:56,100
A lot of good companies
going out and doing cool

419
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,866
things to give
out information.

420
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:01,299
We wanted to add the ICS
or OT flavor to it and say

421
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,766
here is what we're
actually seeing.

422
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,333
First up, we'll
start talking about

423
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,899
vulnerabilities.

424
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,733
When we looked at the
vulnerabilities, we had

425
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,399
great folks on our team,
Reed and Kate and others,

426
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,200
take a look at every
single industrial

427
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:16,065
vulnerability that was
released over the past year.

428
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:19,666
Usually, there's about 400
to 500 any given year and

429
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,899
they are directly
related to how much

430
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,100
people are looking.

431
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,299
Any given year, we might
see a spike of like 700

432
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:27,633
because there was a
conference and somebody

433
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,566
wanted to look more
at the vulnerabilities,

434
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:31,000
which is not great.

435
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,100
In all the places that I
feel super excited, I'm

436
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,466
like, yeah, we can do
this, the vulnerability

437
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,466
side of ICS is something
like the 1990s.

438
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,666
That is an area
that's got to improve.

439
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,233
There are a lot more
vulnerabilities than we

440
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,466
even look for.

441
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,466
But when we look at
the data about the

442
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,966
vulnerabilities, we
can come up with some

443
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,433
interesting findings.

444
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,033
I'm going to go through
the metrics and we'll talk

445
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,733
about a takeaway from it.

446
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,266
First up is that 24% of
those vulnerabilities were

447
00:16:55,333 --> 00:17:00,233
related to the ICS
protocols themselves, 74%

448
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,533
were network exploitable,
and 76% were deep

449
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,500
within the ICS.

450
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,333
So what does
all that mean?

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,966
It largely means that
we've got a nice crunchy

452
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:13,265
exterior, and then once
you get inside, bets are off.

453
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,933
It means that we have
spent a lot of time as a

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,233
community focusing not
only on the protection

455
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,700
equipment that we're using
or segmentation, but also

456
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,900
on the security
of edge devices.

457
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:26,165
When we start looking at
it, the internal is a

458
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,000
little soft and gooey.

459
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,166
A lot of these systems
are insecure by design.

460
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,433
They are systems that if
you had access to them,

461
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,566
you don't need a
vulnerability.

462
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,299
Going back to that stat
earlier where I said more

463
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,733
than 50% are useless.

464
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,333
We'll see vulnerabilities
like, hey, if you have

465
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,000
this vulnerability and you
exploit this POC, you'll

466
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,633
be able to change
this logic.

467
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,033
Okay.

468
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,500
Or I could just sit on the
engineering workstation

469
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,933
and change its logic.

470
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,833
There is no authentication
or anything to stop me

471
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,200
from doing that, so
why would I waste a

472
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,900
vulnerability or
exploit on that?

473
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,632
Those are the kinds of
challenges that we largely

474
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,833
face, and knowing that a
lot of them are network

475
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,599
exploitable and that
they're in the network

476
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,866
protocols themselves, the
hyper focus on endpoint

477
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,566
security that does help in
the enterprises generally

478
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,200
isn't the only way to
approach things in ICS,

479
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,200
especially since we have a
lot of devices that aren't

480
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,099
capable of having
an endpoint.

481
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,566
And even if they did, it's
more about the native

482
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,833
functionality of
that equipment.

483
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
So when you were going
out and looking at your

484
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,099
industrial environments or
advising people looking at

485
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,466
industrial environments,
it's a really important

486
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,632
takeaway to talk about
what you can do in that

487
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,766
environment, not at a
system level, but at a

488
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,666
system of systems level.

489
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:35,066
That's more akin to what
we can do in ICS security

490
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,266
and what we have
got to focus on.

491
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,766
When we further looked at
the vulnerabilities, we

492
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:44,966
found that 55% of them had
a patch but no alternative

493
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,233
mechanism to do security.

494
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:50,200
So the reliability on the
vendor was patch it or

495
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:51,799
don't, but that's
all you get.

496
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,633
And when we went through
the vulnerabilities, we

497
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,099
found that there
were really simple

498
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,265
recommendations that could
have been made that would

499
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,599
have made the
vulnerability not exploitable.

500
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,966
But our community is in
this habit of patch or

501
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,132
don't, patch or don't,
patch or not, what's the

502
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,066
compensating controls.

503
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,166
In the world of industrial
security, we should always

504
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,099
be thinking about what are
the compensating controls

505
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,599
that we could put in place
to actually maintain

506
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,765
security, especially if we
can't patch at any given time.

507
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:21,299
But if you did trust the
patches, it turns out 26%

508
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,466
of them contain
significant errors.

509
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:27,099
More than that had errors,
but 26% had significant errors.

510
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,033
Wrong patch, wrong
vulnerability, wrong

511
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,500
process, wrong device
sometimes, or completely

512
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,500
misstating the actual
scoring mechanism of the

513
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,200
vulnerability itself.

514
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,766
That's not great.

515
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,099
Further, 26% didn't
even have a patch.

516
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,466
It was like here's
a vulnerability.

517
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,765
Have fun, community.

518
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,966
No patch, no security
mechanism to mitigate it.

519
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,866
Just wanted to let you
know that you're screwed.

520
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:49,966
Thanks, guys.

521
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,966
When we look at these
metrics, what they help

522
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:56,399
show, again, is a story
around the difficulty with

523
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,765
just focusing on
vulnerabilities.

524
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,433
How many attacks
have we seen that have

525
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,433
taken advantage of
successfully exploited

526
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,633
vulnerabilities in ICS?

527
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,533
Zero.

528
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,566
Now if you're talking
about ransomware type

529
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,400
stuff and you're seeing
Windows devices, that's fine.

530
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,765
But, actually, in
the control elements

531
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,799
themselves, POCs,
RTUs, safety systems,

532
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,500
engineering workstations,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

533
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,633
we don't see vulnerabilities
being exploited.

534
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,833
Now it's fair to say that
eventually we might if we

535
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,366
do the right security with
everything else, so we

536
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,500
don't want to just ignore
vulnerabilities, but the

537
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,500
attacks we're seeing, the
things that are happening

538
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,166
are using the
native functionality

539
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,033
of that equipment.

540
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,799
If I can open the circuit
breaker as an operator, I

541
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,633
can open the circuit
breaker as an adversary.

542
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,133
We can't just say, well,
we should just put

543
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,866
authentication
across everything.

544
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,766
No, because I don't want
my operator not to be able

545
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,166
to operate the equipment,
especially in a

546
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:45,899
safety consideration.

547
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:48,332
It turns out
security is hard.

548
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,366
Go figure.

549
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,599
And it's really incumbent
upon us to understand the

550
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,633
mission of what
we're doing.

551
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,333
One of the major failures
outside of the metrics

552
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,733
that I see for teams is
when I go into these

553
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,633
plants and these
organizations and they say

554
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,599
here's what we're going to
do for security, instead

555
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,933
of stepping back and realizing
we're digital janitors.

556
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,266
We're supposed to be there
to say, hey, what do you

557
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:07,933
actually need?

558
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,833
What are you trying to do?

559
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,833
What's the business value?

560
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,700
How can we help you?

561
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,533
Let's figure out how to
make this fit for you.

562
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,700
I remember walking into an
environment that didn't

563
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,900
have cameras, it wasn't
like internet connected up

564
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:21,899
or anything, and they had
a sticky note on the HMI

565
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:24,033
with a password.

566
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,099
And I asked the operator
about it jokingly.

567
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,866
I was like did anybody
ever give you crap for this.

568
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:30,500
He was like every
single IT guy.

569
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:31,866
All right.

570
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,400
To him, it was a hassle
that everybody always came

571
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,565
and hassled him about the
password on the sticky note.

572
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,666
I bet most of you would
probably do the same.

573
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:42,500
Except there's no cameras,
there's no understanding of it.

574
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:43,933
I would argue that
until the Russians are

575
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,566
paratrooping into that
station, he's all right.

576
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:49,433
We're training more to pen
testers at times than we

577
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
are to adversaries.

578
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,033
I'm not saying have
sticky notes across you

579
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:54,200
ICS with passwords.

580
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,866
Again, please be careful on
the takeaways from this talk.

581
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,933
What I'm saying though
is let's figure out what

582
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,466
these folks are trying
to do and make sure that

583
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,299
we're building the actual
right security for what

584
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,333
they need because
there are quite a few

585
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,599
threats out there.

586
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,399
If I was standing on this
stage five years ago, we

587
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:12,899
would be talking about
one or two threats.

588
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,500
Historically, we've only
ever talked about one or

589
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,599
two at a time because
we've only seen one or

590
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,566
two at a time.

591
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,700
And any new one was giant
news with reports coming out.

592
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,200
It's like wow.

593
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,900
There's a new adversary
that's phishing the

594
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:26,799
utility sector.

595
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:29,099
And we're like,
yeah, okay.

596
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,166
But now as we started
looking, as we started

597
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,966
diving deeper, as we
started getting visibility

598
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,632
into those industrial
environments, we're able

599
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,666
to say that there are 11
different adversaries, 11

600
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,433
different state actors,
and I would say they are

601
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,833
exclusively state at this
time, that are going after

602
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,966
these industrial environments.

603
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,299
It's not onesies
and twosies.

604
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,233
It's hundreds of victims
that they're going after.

605
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,633
In this past year, we
added two new threats.

606
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,500
When we look at the year
in review piece, there

607
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:56,466
were two new activity
groups that we track.

608
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,033
I stay out of the
attribution game.

609
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,765
For those of you that like
attribution, that's fine.

610
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,533
I don't find the value
in it for my customers

611
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,500
personally, so we
don't focus on it.

612
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:04,866
I feel it is
highly biased.

613
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:09,633
But what I do care about
is is it targeting me, so

614
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,099
is it relevant to me, and
what do I understand about

615
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,366
it so I can use it.

616
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,599
Actually, when we think
about intel, we usually

617
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,233
try to measure it with
CART, complete, accurate,

618
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,733
relevant, and timely.

619
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,633
Is it complete enough for
me to make a decision,

620
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,299
accurate enough for me to
make a right decision,

621
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:25,233
relevant enough to me that
I actually care about it,

622
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,233
and timely enough that I
can use it in a mechanism

623
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:29,333
that helps my
organization.

624
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,533
And when we do that,
we talk about activity

625
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,533
groups, clusters of
intrusions to pull them

626
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,366
together to say here is
how they're targeting,

627
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,166
here's what they're
targeting, here's where

628
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,133
they're going.

629
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,599
And we look at that, we added
Parisite and Wassonite.

630
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,866
I have to really hate my
intel team sometimes when

631
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,233
they come up
with Wassonite.

632
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,333
Wassonite.

633
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,933
And, no, Parisite
is not misspelled.

634
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We use industrial minerals.

635
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,500
So Parisite is a type
of industrial mineral.

636
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,099
This is now a science
discussion and you're

637
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,666
welcome for being
educated, RSA, about

638
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,366
industrial minerals.

639
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,566
Parisite and Wassonite
ended up being two threats

640
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:05,200
that were going after
industrial organizations.

641
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:08,900
Parisite was using the
VPN vulnerabilities and

642
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,366
vulnerabilities in
edge devices right after

643
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,666
they got released.

644
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,566
We saw some
vulnerabilities that were

645
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,599
released for VPNs and
firewalls in remote

646
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,233
connectivity equipment,
and the very next day they

647
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,866
started hitting
those one-day type

648
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:24,366
vulnerabilities going after
these plants and operations.

649
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,866
Obviously, they're not
going to be patching that

650
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,666
quickly, especially those
edge devices, and so the

651
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,332
adversary got to take
advantage of it.

652
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,133
What we found
was interesting.

653
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,299
It was pretty
far and wide.

654
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:36,466
They were going after not
just targets here in the U.S.

655
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,466
but also in the Middle
East and Australia.

656
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,265
They started going after
not only electric, oil,

657
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,466
and gas, but
also aerospace.

658
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,799
They were immediately
using those

659
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,099
vulnerabilities
to get access.

660
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,233
That's that
stage one stuff.

661
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,966
That's not where
we freak out.

662
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,632
That's not where we say,
oh my gosh, we're all

663
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,799
going to die.

664
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,333
That's where we talk about
an adversary getting

665
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,500
access to industrial
operations and now we want

666
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,500
to know what are they
doing, what are they

667
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,466
interested in, what are
they taking, how are

668
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,299
they doing it?

669
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,633
A lot of our time and
focus was after you get

670
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,133
exploited, after they get
access to the industrial

671
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,299
environment, how are
they moving around?

672
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:11,133
What does their lateral
movement look like?

673
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,533
How are they achieving
their operations?

674
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,332
And a lot of it was taking
advantage of living on

675
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,733
land techniques and common
tools and open-source tools.

676
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,333
Same thing with Wassonite.

677
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,433
Wassonite ended up going
more after the Enterprise

678
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
IT networks but then
pivoting immediately into

679
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,500
or trying to get access to
the industrial side of the

680
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,400
house and the
industrial networks.

681
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,065
They were using common
things to do that.

682
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,500
But what was incredibly
interesting to us about

683
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,366
this target, this
adversary is they were

684
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,799
very targeted.

685
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:41,099
When they were going after
targets like a nuclear

686
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,166
company that they went
after, they were hard

687
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:46,166
coding in their internal
IP ranges into the

688
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,000
propagation and ability
to move around the

689
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:50,700
environment, meaning it
wasn't some drive-by and

690
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:51,566
we get access.

691
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,299
It's we know who you are
and we know enough about

692
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,900
your environment to start
hard-coding those RFC 1918

693
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:58,899
addresses into
the malware.

694
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:01,000
Again, fairly
sophisticated in terms of

695
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,933
operations, not necessarily
in terms of malware.

696
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,766
So a lot of the most
sophisticated adversaries

697
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,866
we track are using the
bare minimum and basics of

698
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,733
tooling and capabilities,
which is really smart,

699
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,599
actually, but they're very
targeted and understand

700
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,399
that industrial side of
the house and how to move

701
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,899
around within it.

702
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,666
And probably the most
interesting observation we

703
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,765
had about the threats is
that they are learning

704
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,766
from each other and
there is quite a bit of

705
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,400
proliferation into
other industries.

706
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,366
Another thing that I see
that is something that we

707
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,599
need to work on is we
bifurcate and silo too

708
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,200
much into our
different industries.

709
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:37,033
We say, well, that's an
electric threat and I'm in

710
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,533
the mining sector, so I
don't care about it, or

711
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,733
that's an oil and gas
threat and I'm in the rail

712
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,866
sector, so whatever.

713
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:45,933
I would challenge you to
think about those threats

714
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,866
that are industrial
focused, and if you are

715
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,366
dealing with industrial
networks, try to learn

716
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,200
from those limited case
studies we have - there

717
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:53,900
are only 11 threats we're
tracking right now to do

718
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:57,299
this - because those
threats very quickly have

719
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,966
been showing time and time
again the ability to move

720
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:03,166
into other sectors, and
sometimes it's the fact

721
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,166
that they have been
there all along.

722
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,133
But going back to that
visibility challenge with

723
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,833
the spotlight over the guy
looking for his keys, we

724
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,066
aren't looking for them.

725
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:15,766
I remember a campaign that
launched in 2013 and 2014

726
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,866
that the vendor said
this is focused on the

727
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,599
electric industry.

728
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,566
It's electric.

729
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,233
Focus on electric.

730
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:26,000
And I saw it popping up in
petrochemical and mining places.

731
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:27,966
So we went to them
and said I don't think

732
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:28,799
it's just electric.

733
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:29,466
No, no, no.

734
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,933
It's just electric.

735
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,966
When we finally unraveled
it, what we realized is

736
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,332
all of their customers
were electric companies.

737
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,700
They didn't have mining
and petrochemical companies.

738
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,533
So all the telemetry and
insight they were getting

739
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,332
was saying electric.

740
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,733
But because they didn't
have any other customers,

741
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,133
they didn't know it was
actually quite farther reaching.

742
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,166
So what I would advise for
all of you is when you

743
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,899
read these reports about
industrial threats, use

744
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,966
the language at least.

745
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,733
It's not a reason to
ignore it because you

746
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,500
don't see a mine story popping
up for autonomous vehicles.

747
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:03,833
So we try to want to
get ahead of this.

748
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,500
We don't want to just
focus and over focus on

749
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:07,866
things like
technical indicators.

750
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,599
It's not that the
indicator is bad, but we

751
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,633
all know that indicators
aren't really transposable

752
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
and they're not
highly durable.

753
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:15,566
You have probably seen the
Enterprise MITRE attack

754
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,900
over the past
couple of years.

755
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,399
That's really, really cool
that the community is

756
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:21,099
going much more towards a
trade craft aspect or an

757
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,299
adversary behavior or TTPs
or however you want to call it.

758
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:28,200
And so this past year we
contributed our insights

759
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,133
over to MITRE and said,
hey, you guys are working

760
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,400
on this, you guys and gals
are getting on it, here's

761
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,533
our insights, have fun,
let's collaborate and just

762
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,899
get this out into
the community.

763
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,132
It's launched, freely available
out there for everybody.

764
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,033
I'm going to encourage you
to go take a look at it if

765
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,299
you're in one of these
organizations that have

766
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:45,133
operations or industrial
technologies.

767
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,900
That framework now
provides you an ability to

768
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:51,799
easily talk about and
communicate about what

769
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,066
you're actually trying
to protect, detect, and

770
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,333
respond to, and it does it
in such a way that you can

771
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,299
talk to other organizations
with a common lexicon.

772
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:01,733
That's pretty powerful.

773
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,266
Please don't get in the
habit of doing the bingo

774
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,266
card thing and go I
wrote one detection.

775
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,066
It's green.

776
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:06,799
No, no, no.

777
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:09,299
Try to have a more
defensible position.

778
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,200
But it's absolutely
something that you all

779
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,900
should be able
to go and use.

780
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,533
As an example, we could
take any given activity

781
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,633
group that we track, and
I don't need you to worry

782
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,933
too much about what the
words on the screen are,

783
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,599
but we take any different
activity group we track,

784
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,466
like Electrum, which
was responsible for the

785
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:27,399
Ukraine 2016 electric
power outage, and overlay

786
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,299
what their actual kill
chain was across the

787
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:33,866
different steps and
techniques and tactics in

788
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:36,466
MITRE attack for ICS and
this can give you an

789
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,433
immediate playbook of
sorts of here is exactly

790
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,966
what I need to
be prepared for.

791
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:44,966
Because another challenge
that I see is folks think

792
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,799
that there are
novel attacks.

793
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,900
There aren't
novel attacks.

794
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,666
There is a step in that
chain of events that's

795
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:55,733
novel, but all the other
steps aren't novel.

796
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,599
And you don't need to detect
or protect against everything.

797
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,832
You need to be able to
detect or protect against

798
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,833
some things and then be able
to pivot the investigation.

799
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,433
It's not about can I get
an alert or can I block

800
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,400
something with a firewall.

801
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,099
It's can I tell the story
of what the adversary is

802
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,433
trying to do and
get ahead of it.

803
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,299
Just because they breached
the firewall doesn't mean

804
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:13,099
they're successful.

805
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,832
They've got all that
stage two stuff to do.

806
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,299
We've got time and
opportunity to do it.

807
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,066
The other piece of this,
of course, is just telling

808
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,166
you what the actual big
ones from last year were.

809
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,666
Your mileage may vary
depending on your

810
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,765
organization, but these
are the ones and they will

811
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,500
be available, of course, on
the slides afterwards for you.

812
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,799
As you go and look into
industrial security over

813
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,066
this next year, these
are the ones that we see

814
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,366
popping up time
and time again.

815
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,000
We map them to the
different activity groups

816
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,133
we've seen and said these
are the techniques and

817
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,766
tactics that you should
be paying attention to.

818
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,900
These can offer you up
good use cases or stories

819
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,299
to be able to tell inside
your security to say can

820
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:50,033
we detect this, and can
we detect it reliably?

821
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,000
If it changed a little
bit, could we detect it?

822
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,833
Are we durable in the
mechanism to which we're

823
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,400
going and doing detection?

824
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,799
Some of it is stuff that
should be all right for us.

825
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:58,966
Scripting for execution.

826
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,599
Okay. That's not too crazy.

827
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,666
Let's think about the
different ways to detect

828
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,033
scripting for execution.

829
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:06,066
Some of it is modifying
the engineering

830
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,900
workstations or modifying
the logic on the

831
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,132
controllers themselves.

832
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,299
Okay. That's a little
bit harder now.

833
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,033
How do we get down
into the plants?

834
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,399
And I promise you
that is going to take

835
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:16,000
collaboration and
cooperation with your

836
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,633
plant operations
and engineer staff.

837
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,466
And my best recommendation
for that is a case of cold

838
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,899
drinks and a
box of donuts.

839
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,599
Go out to the substation
or go out to the plant and

840
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,200
say, hey, I'm
here to learn.

841
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,666
What can I do for you?

842
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,599
Start engaging that other
side of the house because

843
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,633
it's got to be a one-team
thing if we're going to

844
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,333
get ahead of
these threats.

845
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
The top ones that we have
observed, the things that

846
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,033
I really want to
highlight, first up was

847
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,099
those living off
the land activities.

848
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,366
Again, the hyper focus on
exploits, malware, and

849
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,866
vulnerabilities is going
to misguide you in trying

850
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:47,099
to detect these threats.

851
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,666
I also see a lot of
organizations that really

852
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,599
just want to apply some
level of machine learning or

853
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,366
baseline to the environment
and say this is good.

854
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,900
What's the
problem with that?

855
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,000
The problem is if you
start white-listing out

856
00:31:58,066 --> 00:32:00,900
communications that today
were good and we're not

857
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,565
dealing with exploits and
vulnerabilities but living

858
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,433
on land techniques,
tomorrow those same good

859
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,266
behaviors could be
used maliciously by

860
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,866
adversaries, so
you won't see it.

861
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,033
There are a couple times
this past year we did

862
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,033
incident response
cases where they had

863
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,933
white-listed out so many
things that they didn't

864
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,799
see the adversary at all.

865
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,766
You want to be careful
with how we're approaching

866
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,566
security in this space.

867
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,966
Another one, persistent
compromised accounts.

868
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:24,132
I think that's a really
good one because

869
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,466
enterprise security
worries about the same

870
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,299
thing, so figuring out
exactly how to get around

871
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,466
identity access and
figuring out who is

872
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,000
accessing our
environment is good.

873
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:34,666
I'm not saying go deploy
multifactor authentication

874
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:35,666
on everything.

875
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:38,200
It's a great way to really
tick off all the operators.

876
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:39,700
Maybe ease them into it.

877
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:41,333
But maybe it's creating
choke points in our

878
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
environment where we say,
look, we're going to have

879
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:45,066
some connections come in,
but at least we're going

880
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,533
to be able to monitor them
through a choke point.

881
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,599
At least we're going to
be able to see what's

882
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,000
happening and
get ahead of it.

883
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,966
Another one, of course,
is modifying that

884
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:52,533
control logic itself.

885
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,332
The detection of that is
absolutely going to be in

886
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,099
that east/west traffic
down in the plants.

887
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,933
The response to it,
though, again, is going to

888
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,833
have to be with the
operators to understand

889
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,866
exactly what was changed
and why that matters.

890
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:10,366
A lot of incident response
in ICS isn't going in and

891
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,433
doing containment and
eradication and recovery.

892
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,099
I don't know any operators
that's like you go ahead

893
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,133
and rebuild the HMI.

894
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,566
That's not happening.

895
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:19,466
A lot of what it is, is
understanding the root

896
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,299
cause analysis and being
able to advise the

897
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,666
operation staff on here
are your choices and here

898
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,899
is what really happened,
so they don't respond to

899
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,233
it like it's a
maintenance event when it's

900
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,666
actually a cyberattack.

901
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,000
The other thing that I
thought was interesting,

902
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,799
even though as we move
onto the next slide, was

903
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:34,933
the last bullet there
about using multiple teams.

904
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,766
We have seen this
time and time again.

905
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,299
You are not going up against
one abstracted adversary.

906
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,766
That's another reason I
dislike the discussion of

907
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,400
it's Iran or it's Russia
or it's China, which might

908
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,233
work for some of you.

909
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,833
Again, I'm not here on
stage to tell you how to

910
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,966
live your life.

911
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,933
But on the attribution
side, you do not have some

912
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,633
monolithic threat.

913
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,766
You have teams that
work together, you have

914
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,233
countries that work
together, you have

915
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,799
countries that have
private sector teams as well.

916
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,933
The one team that develops
the malware may not be the

917
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,799
same team that uses the
malware, it may not be the

918
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,366
same team that's setting
up the infrastructure, it

919
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,400
may not be the same team
that's choosing the targets.

920
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:10,299
That makes everything
blurry, but it also means

921
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:13,300
a lot of proliferation
of that trade craft.

922
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:15,533
So you want to go back and
say, hey, defense is doable.

923
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,500
Why am I concerned?

924
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,399
Why are we
talking about this?

925
00:34:17,466 --> 00:34:18,933
Because the threats are
going to learn from each

926
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,366
other real quick, and
we're already seeing it.

927
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:24,433
One of the things we saw
this past year was very

928
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,033
clearly seeing that one of
the teams that was going

929
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,800
after industrial
environments was not the

930
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,866
same team getting access
or developing capabilities.

931
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:34,666
The point that the team
that used the capability

932
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,900
in the industrial
environment messed it up

933
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:39,199
because they didn't fully
understand how it worked.

934
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,300
It wasn't good
documentation on the

935
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,400
adversary's code.

936
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,665
That's not to say don't
do documentation either.

937
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,000
You should definitely
do documentation

938
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,500
when you're coding.

939
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,899
They have that same
problem in the adversary land.

940
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:51,866
What about our most
dangerous tactics?

941
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,533
The most dangerous one,
of course, was the safety

942
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,233
system compromise.

943
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,366
It only happened in
Saudi Arabia, right?

944
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:58,966
True.

945
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,133
The safety system piece
only happened in Saudi

946
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,066
Arabia, but that threat
that we tracked Xenotime,

947
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:06,566
we've since seen them
across different GCC countries.

948
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,033
We've seen them
across Europe.

949
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,800
We've seen them
across Australia.

950
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,833
We've seen them targeting
not just oil and gas in

951
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,866
the United States.

952
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,966
We saw them go after and
try to target about a

953
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:17,098
dozen electric
companies as well.

954
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,800
The same threats, the same
team that tried to kill

955
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:22,766
people at a petrochemical
facility is now beginning

956
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,133
that stage one against
other places, other

957
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,599
countries, other
industries.

958
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,033
So, yeah, I do want you to
know that safety system

959
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,733
compromise is something
you'd better pay attention

960
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,500
to because it's also going
to be in your incident

961
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,899
response playbook
discussion of going in to

962
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,232
do incident response at a
facility under attack with

963
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,000
no safety system in play.

964
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:42,665
It's now an
unsafe environment.

965
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,466
How are you going to deal
with that in terms of your

966
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:45,799
responders and actually
how you're trying to

967
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:48,333
operate in that facility
in that situation?

968
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,966
You'd better be having
business continuity and

969
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,665
disaster recovery
plan discussions with

970
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,099
a cyber element.

971
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,500
A lot of times, we see
companies that have an

972
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,399
incident response plan
that have a paragraph for

973
00:35:56,466 --> 00:36:01,000
ICS that says call and go
have those conversations

974
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:02,299
ahead of time.

975
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,433
The other thing we have
seen is an increased

976
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,199
use of ransomware.

977
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,533
I think everybody
is seeing that.

978
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,066
What we found interesting
this past year is the

979
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,533
first ICS-focused
ransomware, EKANS.

980
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,533
And so it was actually
pulling in some

981
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,533
understanding of ICS into
the development of the

982
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,066
malware and what
it was doing.

983
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,665
Early days.

984
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:21,066
I'm not freaking out about
that malware right now.

985
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,000
Actually, in a lot of
ways, it's probably

986
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,665
really, really basic, but
it's showing an intent by

987
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,599
adversaries to
specifically be looking

988
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,833
into ICS as they think
about ransomware.

989
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,699
Now we're not just
thinking about holding a

990
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:36,300
bank hostage or holding
some enterprise networks

991
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:39,133
hostage, but trying to get
to a point where they can

992
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,666
hold an electric power
site hostage or your

993
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,366
manufacturing lines with
a must deploy critical

994
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,599
assets and must keep production
up kind of environments.

995
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,766
That's something that we
really need to get ahead of.

996
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,633
And then lastly on that,
some of the ransomware

997
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,833
cases we saw weren't
really about the ransomware.

998
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,166
I don't know why
threats do this.

999
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,800
Personally, I don't think
it's really that smart,

1000
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,866
but who am I to judge
the adversaries.

1001
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,866
As they're going in and
they're successfully doing

1002
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,933
intellectual property
theft, then deploy

1003
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,733
ransomware at the end to
kind of burn the bridges

1004
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,666
at the end.

1005
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,133
I don't think that's super
smart because it actually

1006
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,800
leaves behind a lot of
forensic evidence and it

1007
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:12,166
just really points it out, but
it's something that can occur.

1008
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:15,466
In one incident response
case we did, it was a

1009
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,598
targeted threat that
compromised a company.

1010
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,199
It got into the industrial
environment, did what they

1011
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:24,266
needed to do, but it was
because they compromised

1012
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,199
that facility and kind of
left the connectivity open

1013
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:29,500
that somebody else used
it to deploy ransomware

1014
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:30,500
at the end.

1015
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:33,133
That first threat got
compromised by not

1016
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,266
patching afterwards.

1017
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,366
Yeah, that's good.

1018
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,766
So by not cleaning
up after themselves.

1019
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,466
So, the other lessons
learned from the incident

1020
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,933
response side that I hope
you can take and use with

1021
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,400
you is 100% of the cases
that we did incident

1022
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,665
response on, you could
directly access the

1023
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,766
industrial control systems
from the internet.

1024
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,333
Not all controls are
good for everybody, but

1025
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,366
segmentation is one of
those things we need to

1026
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,033
be careful of.

1027
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,800
There is no such
thing as air gaps.

1028
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:58,900
Get over that.

1029
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,299
But we absolutely want
to have some level of

1030
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,333
segmentation not to
directly interact with

1031
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,533
industrial control systems
from the internet.

1032
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,633
Another aspect is when we
walked into our cases, 51%

1033
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:11,099
of the time that we got
called on IR engagements,

1034
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,333
they handed us information
to be helpful and it was

1035
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
the wrong information.

1036
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,566
Their diagrams, their
inventories, their

1037
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,466
understanding of their own
facility was so far out of

1038
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:22,699
date that we started to
stop listening to folks

1039
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,633
because it was misleading
the responders and they

1040
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:26,900
had to actually go and do
their work, slowing down

1041
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,900
incident response to have
to go do all the things

1042
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:31,199
you should be doing
ahead of time.

1043
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:36,066
Zero percent, zero, of our
incident response cases

1044
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,299
were benefitted from
any level of deployed

1045
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:41,500
visibility, monitoring,
aggregated logging, or

1046
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:43,832
anything that was going to
be helpful along those lines.

1047
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,666
Zero percent.

1048
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,699
There's something to go
work on this next year,

1049
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,033
whatever you're doing,
trying to pull together

1050
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,199
the insights and the data
into a central location or

1051
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:56,033
monitoring or logging or some
aspect to help in the cases.

1052
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:59,199
Again, yeah, I think detection
deserves a lot of focus.

1053
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:01,266
I think we have
over-focused on protection

1054
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,266
to the point that we never
detect, we never tune that

1055
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,300
protection, and we never detect
to get to incident response.

1056
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:09,000
I want you to focus on
detection, but think about

1057
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,433
the incident response
first because you can very

1058
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,800
quickly want to respond to
an Xenotime safety system

1059
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:17,533
level compromise and go
the other direction of let

1060
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,366
me deploy identification,
then threat detection, and

1061
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:23,733
one day I'll get to response
and make the wrong choices.

1062
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,033
Instead, think about your
response strategy first

1063
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,099
and work backwards.

1064
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,433
If I'm going to get to
this type of response, I

1065
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,599
need this type
of detection.

1066
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,599
If we can get this type of
detection, here's the type

1067
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,866
of data I need.

1068
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,766
Don't try to collect it
all and just hope it works

1069
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:36,433
out for you.

1070
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,966
Your analyst will
drown in the data.

1071
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:42,866
The top access mechanisms
for these cases and others.

1072
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,533
First one, very simple,
remote services password

1073
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,633
spraying, still a thing to
be aware of, especially

1074
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,099
for all those VPNs.

1075
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,466
Also remember team
viewer is not a VPN.

1076
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,165
Get real VPNs if you're
going to do this in your

1077
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:54,599
industrial environments.

1078
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,199
Accidental malware infections
absolutely still occur.

1079
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:59,566
In many cases, if you
can detect the more

1080
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,633
sophisticated threats,
you're going to be able to

1081
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,699
detect the accidental
malware, some of the

1082
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:06,833
tactics overlay
really nicely.

1083
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,566
The big one, though, is
the shared network access.

1084
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,732
A lot of companies
put so much focus,

1085
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,300
understandably, on
segmentation at the

1086
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:16,033
Enterprise level.

1087
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,300
Hey, we're going to keep
them out of the OT or the

1088
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:19,099
ICS networks.

1089
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,366
They've got to come
through us first, except

1090
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:22,800
that's not true.

1091
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:25,666
Your operations have
direct access very

1092
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,366
commonly to your OEMs,
your vendors, your

1093
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,800
suppliers, your
integrators, your

1094
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:32,333
maintenance folks, and
so they don't have to go

1095
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,866
through the IT networks
to get to the plants.

1096
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:37,099
They have got access to
those vendors and those

1097
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,933
vendors are getting
compromised and people are

1098
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,900
abusing those accesses.

1099
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:45,098
We responded to numerous
cases doing that this past year.

1100
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,033
Please be careful of it.

1101
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:47,066
Get in the environment.

1102
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:49,665
Don't just get in the IT
network and do a pin test

1103
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,066
or otherwise to get
into the OT side.

1104
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:54,198
Get in the OT side
and do it out.

1105
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:57,199
Once inside the operations
environment, can we get out?

1106
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,000
How would we get out?

1107
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,366
What are the
access methods?

1108
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:00,599
Those are going to
give you a better

1109
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,133
recommendation of actually
what to go secure.

1110
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,099
And, of course, quite a bit
of ICS-themed watering holes.

1111
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,300
It makes so much sense.

1112
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:08,033
It seems really basic.

1113
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,699
But if you're going to
go target a bunch of

1114
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:12,500
industrial environmnents,
you're going to have two really

1115
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:13,933
big challenges immediately.

1116
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,699
One, getting into the ICS side
itself, and two, getting out.

1117
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,833
We just talked
about this, right?

1118
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,500
ICS-themed water holes
are great because you're

1119
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,698
usually looking at ICS
software that they're

1120
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:27,500
going and downloading
already, so they're going

1121
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,899
immediately into the ICS.

1122
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:29,900
You've got a nice path in.

1123
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:33,366
And then we also see a lot
of the VPN software still

1124
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:35,500
getting compromised, very
similar to the Havex

1125
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:40,066
malware campaign from 2014
where if I'm on an ICS

1126
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,332
system that they're
installing ICS VPNs, it's

1127
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,166
very likely it's got a
connectivity connection out.

1128
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:47,133
It's a really smart thing
for an adversary to do, so

1129
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,533
I want you to
get ahead of it.

1130
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,800
On the proactive side
of the house, a lot of

1131
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:54,466
companies are being
proactive, so kudos to them.

1132
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:56,699
Again, a lot of times we
think that these ICS folks

1133
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:57,533
aren't doing anything.

1134
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,666
So many good folks are
doing so much good work

1135
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,466
around the community.

1136
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:06,232
But 100% of the clients
we went into, 100% that

1137
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,633
believed they had an
air gap had multiple

1138
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:10,466
routes of communication.

1139
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,633
We have not found this
mythical air gap.

1140
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,166
I don't think
we're going to.

1141
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:15,599
Be careful on that.

1142
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,366
But multiple routes in.

1143
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,933
Seventy-six percent
weren't able to detect any

1144
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,300
of our red teams no matter
how much we brought it down.

1145
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,599
We don't go in to say,
hey, let's - no red teams

1146
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,633
should go in to say let's
knock the doors down and

1147
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:28,733
make the blue
team embarrassed.

1148
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,900
That's not the goal.

1149
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:32,165
The goal is, okay, at what
level can you detect us

1150
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,199
and then can we go beyond
that so we can figure out

1151
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:35,533
where we need to
take security.

1152
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,233
Seventy-six percent of
them, no matter how much

1153
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,900
we tried to tailor it,
were unsuccessful.

1154
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,966
They didn't have the
right tooling, people, or

1155
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:44,266
process around what they
were doing to be successful.

1156
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,033
Seventy-on percent of our
assessments we were able

1157
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,199
to traverse into critical
ICS networks directly from

1158
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,199
the IT side of the house.

1159
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,966
There's a lot of porous
exchange between our networks.

1160
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:58,665
Please don't just over focus
on things like segmentation.

1161
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,800
The next one, though, is
something that's not as

1162
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:03,733
relevant to all of you,
but it's extremely

1163
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,866
relevant for our OEMs or
our original equipment

1164
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:09,433
manufacturers, the big
ICS vendors of the world.

1165
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,333
We found in our
engagements that 91% of

1166
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,266
all of our clients had
significant opportunities

1167
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,900
to do hardening on that
equipment or the software

1168
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:21,598
or the systems themselves
and were blocked from

1169
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,166
doing so by the vendor.

1170
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,566
They wanted to do
the right thing.

1171
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,698
They were trying to do
security in their environments.

1172
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:30,699
But based on a
misunderstanding of

1173
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:35,199
warranties or cultural
gaps, they were blocked.

1174
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:37,966
If you're an OEM in this
space, I will challenge

1175
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,199
you for this next year
that your takeaway of this

1176
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:43,266
presentation, your
opportunity this next year

1177
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,266
is to go figure out where
the barriers are for your

1178
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,166
clients and figure out how
to enable them to do some

1179
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:49,800
of the basic hardening
things that will

1180
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,833
absolutely help us out.

1181
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,233
That is an easy way
to get a real good win

1182
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,500
across the community.

1183
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,299
What are our recommended
controls from all these

1184
00:43:58,366 --> 00:44:01,500
different insights as we start
winding down the presentation?

1185
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:03,299
First and foremost,
yeah, please go have an

1186
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:06,933
ICS-specific incident
response, some level of plan.

1187
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,400
Test it out with a
tabletop exercise.

1188
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:11,066
You want to talk about
bringing culture together?

1189
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:14,399
Do a tabletop exercise
of the IT security team first.

1190
00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:16,598
Then once you got your
stuff together, do it

1191
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:19,966
again with the operations
folks and figure out the

1192
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:23,199
things that you thought and
see if they were still valid.

1193
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,900
See if the assumptions you
made were good, if the

1194
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,766
POCs, the point of
contacts you thought

1195
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,000
existed were
the right ones.

1196
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,665
Time and time again, we
see teams learn entirely

1197
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:33,433
new things about their
facilities, operations,

1198
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,699
and people, just by
getting in a room with an

1199
00:44:35,766 --> 00:44:36,900
inject and
talking about it.

1200
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,833
Don't make it silly.

1201
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,099
Make it something real.

1202
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,866
Use one of the scenarios
that we're talking about.

1203
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,033
Use that as the scenario.

1204
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,366
Because another good way
to lose operations is if

1205
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,699
you're like, yeah,
they came in with like

1206
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:47,800
lasers from space.

1207
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:49,300
No, no, no.

1208
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,000
Keep it real and keep it
focused on what actually

1209
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,000
can happen in the
industrial environment.

1210
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,133
Yeah, please get around
the ICS-specific

1211
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,000
visibility and threat
detection piece.

1212
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,399
Don't just hyper focus on
anomalies or indicators.

1213
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:01,098
Start looking at those
behaviors that we as a

1214
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,033
community are learning
about, those tactics.

1215
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:06,400
Go look at those MITRE
attack ICS use cases and

1216
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:08,900
figure out how am
I going to do this.

1217
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,933
Multi-factor
authentication, it's an

1218
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,466
easy control to recommend,
but here's how you do it

1219
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:14,900
in an ICS environment.

1220
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:19,866
First and foremost, I do
not want my MFA to be

1221
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,300
requiring the Cloud.

1222
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:22,733
I'm not Cloud
apprehensive at all.

1223
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,400
I do think there is a lot
of Cloud-driven stuff that

1224
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:27,400
can actually provide a
lot of security in our

1225
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,098
environments, but I don't
want the multi-factor

1226
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,566
authentication to require
Cloud connectivity,

1227
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,332
because when we're dealing
with industrial operations

1228
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,666
in industrial
environments, it's very

1229
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,433
common that we'll lose
that access or need to

1230
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,866
lose that access.

1231
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,599
So having something that
we can manage and do on

1232
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,699
prem for at least that
control makes a lot of sense.

1233
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,033
The same thing when we
start looking at MFA.

1234
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,000
It might not be all
of our connections.

1235
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:46,933
Remember what
I said earlier.

1236
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,333
Have a choke point.

1237
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,166
Have an opportunity
to monitor that.

1238
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:52,833
But maybe my remote
maintenance personnel that

1239
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,599
are agreeing to come into
my facility that I don't

1240
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,966
have good SLAs with, that
I don't really know how to

1241
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:59,066
get ahead of the problems,
and maybe they're going to

1242
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:01,198
get compromised, maybe
I require them to have

1243
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:04,433
multi-factor
authentication, or not all

1244
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,199
of my industrial
environment, but maybe my

1245
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,033
networks that are going
to the safety system.

1246
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,000
They say that's so
critical that we're going

1247
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:11,366
to treat it just a
little bit different.

1248
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,166
Have that kind of discussion.

1249
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,566
And then lastly,
of course, yes,

1250
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:18,098
vulnerabilities, but please
take a risk-based approach.

1251
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,800
I see so many teams waste
so many resources building

1252
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,266
this giant vulnerability
management program to go

1253
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,599
and identify and
think about all the

1254
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:28,599
vulnerabilities to not
patch them or to patch all

1255
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,133
the ones that are useless.

1256
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,300
For many of the people
that we look at, if their

1257
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:35,633
patch policy or their
patch rate is above 36%,

1258
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,933
they're largely wasting
resources because they're

1259
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,666
going and patching
the wrong things.

1260
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:42,300
So, again, not don't
patch, but please be

1261
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,400
thoughtful in doing it and
realizing that that's not

1262
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:46,466
the big problem
we see today.

1263
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:48,732
How do you use this
after the conference?

1264
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,133
All right.

1265
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:52,166
First week, you're going
to go back and you're

1266
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:53,366
going to detox.

1267
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,666
You're going to be like,
hey, I didn't get coronavirus.

1268
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:56,500
Yay, me.

1269
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:57,198
That's good.

1270
00:46:57,266 --> 00:46:58,133
All right?

1271
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,000
Then you're going to sleep
it off, you're going to

1272
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,198
catch up on some emails.

1273
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:02,400
That's good.

1274
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:04,000
But I want you to get
right back to work because

1275
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,033
this always happens.

1276
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,400
You go to a conference,
you talk to the peers,

1277
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:08,598
it's like a therapy
session, we feel good, and

1278
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,833
then you don't apply it.

1279
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,466
So in the first week back
after you detox, 7-30 days,

1280
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:16,400
I want you to pick out three
to five of those scenarios.

1281
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,232
I want you to use intel
and consequence-driven.

1282
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,599
In other words, take like
two scenarios that we

1283
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,266
talked about from an
intel perspective.

1284
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,933
If you're an electric
utility, great example.

1285
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,533
And you're preparing for
what happens if China,

1286
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,199
Russia, Iran, and North
Korea all team up on us at

1287
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:33,266
once, but you didn't cover
Ukraine 2015 and 2016

1288
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,366
scenarios, that's a problem.

1289
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:36,900
Go take the things that
we know about, the things

1290
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,500
that were ground-truth
reality, go pick two

1291
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:42,165
scenarios that are
intel-driven, then pick

1292
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,800
one or two by talking
with your plant folks and

1293
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:46,633
figuring out
consequence-driven.

1294
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,699
What can go wrong
regardless of what the

1295
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:50,133
threats are doing?

1296
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,300
I routinely walk into
plants, find the oldest,

1297
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:56,333
crustiest-looking engineer
I can, I'm like, hey, man,

1298
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,933
what would be a
bad day for you?

1299
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,366
Oh, man, that turbine over
there, if that goes out of

1300
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:02,099
control, woo, run.

1301
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:02,766
Thank you.

1302
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,433
Now that is a
consequence-driven

1303
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,366
scenario, so I'm going to
go figure out what is the

1304
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,366
cyber component of that so
we can get ahead of it.

1305
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,300
Go pick out three
to five of those.

1306
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,300
You probably will not be
able to do more than five,

1307
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:17,466
so pick three to five, set
realistic goals, then, out

1308
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:20,232
of those, map what
you already have.

1309
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,900
You probably already have
some level of controls.

1310
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,699
What did you already
invest in that's relevant?

1311
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:26,199
A lot of companies will
buy a product and not even

1312
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:27,400
deploy it fully.

1313
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:28,766
Figure out what you've
already made investments

1314
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:32,166
into that can tell your
story and where your gaps are.

1315
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,199
Specifically, again, think
about it from response, to

1316
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,233
detection, to collection,
not going the other way.

1317
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,266
Once you figure those
out, go and do a tabletop

1318
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,199
exercise about it.

1319
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:43,166
About the two-month point,
I want some level of

1320
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:45,099
internal tabletop exercise.

1321
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:45,833
Just a chat.

1322
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,133
It doesn't have to
be anything too big.

1323
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:50,400
From there, I want you
to take that tabletop

1324
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,866
exercise, pick four
or five controls.

1325
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:56,166
Please do not develop this
multi-year road map with

1326
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,000
50, 30, 40, 50 controls.

1327
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,265
You're not going to
get done with it.

1328
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,666
It's not going to happen.

1329
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:02,699
And it's not also going to
happen at the time and the

1330
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:05,000
rate you want it
to in industrial.

1331
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:08,466
Pick up to five things,
segmentation, monitoring,

1332
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:12,165
visibility, an incident
response plan, some level

1333
00:49:12,233 --> 00:49:13,433
of key vulnerability analysis.

1334
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,133
Whatever it's going to be,
pick a couple controls off

1335
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,866
of what would apply for
those tabletop exercises.

1336
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:24,099
Then from 120 to 180 days -
excuse me, 90 to 180 days,

1337
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,666
it's really
about actioning it.

1338
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:29,266
The 90 to 120-day period,
do an assessment yourself.

1339
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,333
Don't call in the firms
like mine unless you have to.

1340
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,266
Go do your own
thing first.

1341
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,466
Get in your environment,
learn your people, try to

1342
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:37,900
do a self-assessment.

1343
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:40,333
You always want to bring
in outside expertise later

1344
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,166
because you can validate
or invalidate and break

1345
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,866
things like group think
because we've got a lot of

1346
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:46,766
bias in our field, but we
can do it ourselves for

1347
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,533
the first couple.

1348
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,033
Then about 120 to 180-day
period, figure out what

1349
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:53,800
the actual people,
process, and technology

1350
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,366
piece of this is going to
look like because that's

1351
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,066
going to be important.

1352
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:59,366
Now it's going to be an
informed strategy tailored

1353
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,199
to you and your threat
landscape instead of just

1354
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,433
general controls
up on a stage.

1355
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,666
Hopefully, through this
presentation, I've given

1356
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:08,500
you some things to think
about, some ways to

1357
00:50:08,566 --> 00:50:10,665
approach it, some key
tactics and techniques to

1358
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:12,333
look at, some key
challenges we saw over

1359
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,866
the last year.

1360
00:50:13,933 --> 00:50:15,833
But I'll remind you,
you can do this.

1361
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,733
Our community
is worth doing.

1362
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,466
It's worth getting right.

1363
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,299
Our infrastructure, our
people, our community

1364
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:22,133
depend upon it.

1365
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,300
It's not about just
protecting the database.

1366
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:27,500
It's about protecting
our people, and you are

1367
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,299
empowered to do so.

1368
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:32,199
If you need to get started
and don't know where to get

1369
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:35,300
started, I have a blog that
I wrote which is free resources.

1370
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,699
Just packet captures,
YouTube videos, whitepapers.

1371
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:40,599
It's actually
pretty selfish.

1372
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,966
I get all these people
that come up to me,

1373
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:43,900
wonderful people like you,
and they come up and go,

1374
00:50:43,966 --> 00:50:45,665
Rob, I loved everything,
how do you get started,

1375
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,066
and I got so tired of
answering the question.

1376
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:47,732
I just wrote a blog.

1377
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,400
There you go.

1378
00:50:48,466 --> 00:50:49,066
There's your blog.

1379
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,500
That's how you
get started.

1380
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:53,366
The next step after that,
go figure out your local

1381
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:54,766
infrastructure community.

1382
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,333
If you want to get into
this field, every utility,

1383
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,966
mining company, oil and
gas, they're hiring.

1384
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:02,098
Go talk to them.

1385
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,166
They'll take care of you.

1386
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:04,033
Take a box of donuts.

1387
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:05,066
You'll get it right.

1388
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:06,133
We'll get it
right together.

1389
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:06,666
Thank you so much.
