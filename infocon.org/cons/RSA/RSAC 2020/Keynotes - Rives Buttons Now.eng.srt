1
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,132
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome storyteller, poet

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:13,199
and six-time TED
speaker, Rives.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,266
>> RIVES: Good
morning, everybody.

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,133
Good morning to you all.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,699
Welcome to day two.

6
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:20,165
Welcome to the session.

7
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,066
The theme of the
conference this year, of

8
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,133
course, is the
human element.

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,933
And as part of that
theme, we have got these

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,133
beautiful installations;
they're called

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,000
the human element.

12
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,266
There are three of them.

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,065
There's one upstairs,
there's one in the sandbox

14
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,000
area, and there's one
directly out those doors

15
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,899
and to the right.

16
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:38,600
And they're cool.

17
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,833
It's a big magnetic board.

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,399
It's a colorful cerebellum
shape made up of

19
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,733
these little nodes.

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,100
And as you get closer, you
see the nodes are buttons.

21
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:47,933
They're magnetic buttons.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
You're encouraged to
take off one or two.

23
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,965
Put them on yourself.

24
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,000
Wear them like I've got
with troublemaker and

25
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,333
peacemaker and like
many of you have here.

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,733
And the buttons
have words on them.

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,899
They've got descriptors
and the descriptors cover

28
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:03,000
a whole range of
characteristics.

29
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:06,433
You've got MacGyver and
giver and nurturer.

30
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,900
Bad ass is very
popular, I'm told.

31
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,565
George Takei chose a
little green sensei pin

32
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,199
for his presentation
yesterday.

33
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,299
But if those words don't
exactly represent what you

34
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,700
are trying to represent,
there are the blank buttons.

35
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,599
Take a blank button.

36
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,566
You take a white gel pen
and you can fill in, draw,

37
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,833
design whatever you want
your button to look like

38
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,400
and that really
gets me going.

39
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:31,798
A lot of my work is
interactivity and self,

40
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,733
you know, kind of
realization, and words.

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
So, I thought I would like
to make a document of the

42
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,399
write-in candidates.

43
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,765
So, I loaded blank
buttons into a tablet.

44
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,400
I took a stylus and I
wandered around the RSAC

45
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,933
Conference grounds.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,266
I met many, many of you
which is an easy thing to do.

47
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,798
You are friendly,
talkative people.

48
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,700
And I showed you how to
pick out a brush and I

49
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:56,633
showed you how to pick out
a style and you can write

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,599
or draw whatever you want
and I put them all together.

51
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,133
I told people this is not
a physical button, right,

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,700
so you don't have to
wear it, but it is you.

53
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:07,866
So, put something on there
that you want people to know

54
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,000
about you, something they
may not know from looking.

55
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,866
And I put together the results and they look like this.

56
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,198
Get a little
music for this.

57
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:18,366
First of all, there is a
very strong body image,

58
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,198
self-image vibe
going on here.

59
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,233
Someone wrote sexy.

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,733
Someone else wrote sexy.

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,099
We have a proud
chubby hubby.

62
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,366
We have an I'm an OK
Boomer in an intentionally

63
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,632
fuzzy font which
is a nice touch.

64
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:37,133
And then pretty
fly for a tech guy.

65
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,199
And this, this is -
maybe you all know this.

66
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:42,266
I did not.

67
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,766
This is the word "hot" in
binary, just H-O-T because

68
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,733
what is hotter
than binary?

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,466
Nothing.

70
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,399
Nothing is.

71
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,400
Nothing.

72
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,766
Leaning in.

73
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,633
Pronoun preferences.

74
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,033
We have a biker in the
house, a baker in the

75
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,866
house and then we have
a biker in the house.

76
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,833
We've got dad of nine.

77
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
I love that the dad did
not write the number nine,

78
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,833
did not write the word
nine, just nine strokes

79
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,300
for each loving child.

80
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,833
Kind of kind.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,633
I love this.

82
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,666
Tired, to be honest.

83
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,233
Mot going to lie, this is
my Monday button going forward.

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,099
Work in progress.

85
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,266
Also kind of
humble, right?

86
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,333
Maybe someday we will get
the period onto the actual

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
button, maybe not,
doesn't matter.

88
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,533
Who cares?

89
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,333
You don't need to.

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,500
Think outside the button.

91
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,433
A lot of swagger
in the house.

92
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,433
Bitchin' speller,
for sure.

93
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,033
Also, this guy, this
is the button that

94
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,066
the person designed.

95
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,900
I am going to now - me,
I am going to digitally

96
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,633
mirror image this so you
can see that is no joke.

97
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,066
I can't do that
well forward.

98
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,066
Beat Stanford.

99
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,866
Apparently after
consultation, this is Cal

100
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,833
Berkeley blue and that
drawing is a bear and it

101
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
is the back - it is
showing you its bear side

102
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,233
is what that
is apparently.

103
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
This person wants you to
know that not only are

104
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,133
they a Leo but they have
lovely design sense.

105
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,266
I love this button.

106
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,500
This person might not be
who you think they are.

107
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,400
This person, I don't know
how they're going to wear

108
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,533
this, where
they're pointing.

109
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,799
But you know, represent.

110
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,066
Same thing.

111
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,300
If you think this might
be related, either this

112
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:17,000
person is a trained Navy
SEAL or they're enjoying

113
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:19,166
the conference in a breezier
way than some of us.

114
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,000
Or me anyway.

115
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:22,433
I don't know what
you guys are doing.

116
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,933
This is a 2020 exclusive.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,766
This person got a positive
pregnancy result.

118
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,066
They said they are not
ready to share with anyone

119
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,832
but they are willing to
share it with everybody.

120
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,566
So, congratulations
to you.

121
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:36,399
Your colleagues will be
finding out very soon, yeah.

122
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:39,399
Heavy nerd vibe in the
room which I am 100% down

123
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,133
with my nerd
brothers and sisters.

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,433
We have Atari.

125
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,033
We have one button for the
resistance and one button

126
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,966
for Star Fleet Academy.

127
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,000
So, that would be a Star
Trek/Star Wars tie.

128
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,433
That tie is broken with
a lovely shoutout to our

129
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,133
helmsman Sulu.

130
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,766
Oh my.

131
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,600
Yoga fire.

132
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,399
Now to some of you, this
might be - yeah, this

133
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,466
person really gets into
their yoga practice, and

134
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:05,600
to some of us, maybe you,
it means what Dhalsim says

135
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,100
to you before he breathes
your face off in Street

136
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:08,800
Fighter 2?

137
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:09,765
Who is with me?

138
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,633
Street Fighter 2?

139
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,866
No?

140
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah, there you go.

141
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:19,032
And then there was a heavy
kind of RSA Conference tilt.

142
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,000
Ask me about my Kara
Swisher obsession.

143
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,366
This person came back
later and said I want to

144
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,433
make this a little
less threatening,

145
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,100
so they added this.

146
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,500
Blockchain for President.

147
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:30,599
Build a Firewall.

148
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,166
Hodor, a man who holds back zombies much like you do.

149
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,266
I see threat people.

150
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:40,600
And my favorite,
I'm with Alice.

151
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,966
I'm with Bob.

152
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,666
Thank you very much
everybody who contributed.

153
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,566
Enjoy your session.

154
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,399
If you are interested,
we are going to be doing

155
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:48,233
it again today.

156
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Come up and talk to me.

157
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,466
The question today is what
do you want your 2025

158
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:53,600
button to look like?

159
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,266
Enjoy your session.

160
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:54,699
Thank you.
