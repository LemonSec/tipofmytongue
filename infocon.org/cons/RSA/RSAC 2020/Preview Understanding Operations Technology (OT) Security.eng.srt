(light music)

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,120
- A lot of folks think about

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,530
enterprise security, or
enterprise IT security

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,670
but operations security

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,280
or OT, Operations Technology,
they're just different.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,113
They have different threats,

7
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,219
different mission, different everything.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,850
The security controls and mechanisms

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,683
that you're gonna wanna do

10
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,170
are going to invariably be different

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,010
to reduce a different type of cyber risk.

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,940
The other aspect to
sort of layer on to that

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,820
is everything is OT.

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,970
Usually people think oh,

15
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,830
it's electric utilities or oil and gas,

16
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,770
but it's data centers, it's rail,

17
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,910
it's the football stadiums that we have.

18
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,453
It's water, it's everything.

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,070
Everyone probably has some level
of OT in their environments

20
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,290
or in their companies.

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,550
Some of them they are an OT company really

22
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,540
and the IT is the aftermath.

23
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,600
We need to work together and figure out

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,340
how to approach that security correctly.

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,100
Especially from the human
element, the theme of this.

26
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,290
Too often folks really try
to bifurcate the community

27
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,180
and it's appropriate to treat
IT and OT security differently

28
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,130
but it's not good to actually treat us all

29
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,490
like we're not the right people

30
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,570
or you don't have the
right people on the team.

31
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,510
You can approach it differently

32
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,294
and it's still all the same community.

33
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,794
