00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,666
>> SPEAKER: To lead
today's discussion, please

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,133
welcome moderator
Mark Montgomery.

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,033
>> MARK MONTGOMERY:
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,066
I'm the Executive
Director of the Cyberspace

5
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,099
Solarium Commission.

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,266
I'm fortunate to be joined
by three of our august

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:26,232
Commissioners here today,
Frank Cilluffo, the

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,033
Director of the McCrary
Institute for Critical

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,733
Infrastructure and
Cybersecurity, Suzanne

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,333
Spaulding, the Senior
Advisor from the Center

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,600
for Strategic and
International Studies, and

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,266
Chris Inglis, the Looker
Chair for Cybersecurity

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,033
Studies at the United
States Naval Academy and

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,266
the former Deputy Director
of National Security Agency.

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,600
I thought I would get us
started with just one or

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,666
two questions, and I know
to go very iterative.

17
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,833
I've been at 30 commission
meetings and silence is

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,899
not one of the
principles practiced.

19
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,899
So maybe I'd start first
with Suzanne and ask her

20
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:04,366
what's the basis - what's
the word Cyberspace Solarium?

21
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,666
Where does Solarium come
from, the historical context?

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,333
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: Yeah.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,166
Mark, I get that
question a lot.

24
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:13,233
The Solarium is a
reference really to a room

25
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,799
in the White House, on the
top floor of the White

26
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:20,066
House that Eisenhower used
to like to use usually to

27
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,666
meet with folks from
outside of the government.

28
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,900
He would bring them into the Solarium for conversations.

29
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,866
But in this case, it
was a meeting of his key

30
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,700
national security advisors
that took place, I

31
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:36,133
believe, in the summer
of 1953, not long after

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,299
Stalin's death, and a
discussion around what

33
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,200
should the American
strategy be going forward

34
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,066
with respect to
dealing with Russia.

35
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,533
As the conversation
proceeded, he realized

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,700
that he had some pretty
significant disagreements

37
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,733
among his national
security team.

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,733
At either end was the
push, roll back, strong,

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,966
aggressive approach, and
on the other side was kind

40
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,500
of more of the
containment, as we know

41
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,500
from George Kennan who was
in the room with Dellis

42
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:10,533
and other senior advisors.

43
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,833
Eisenhower worried that
this disagreement could

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,733
lead to a lack of
coherence and in a

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,966
strategy going forward on
a very important issue for

46
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,599
the national security
of the country.

47
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,900
So he developed a process.

48
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:32,066
He told the folks to go
off to create three teams

49
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,599
to look at the various key
approaches that had been

50
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,333
advised and work up their
best arguments for each

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,800
and come back and report
to him, which they did in

52
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:42,000
a very fast
turnaround timeframe.

53
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:46,066
And not surprisingly, his
conclusion was there's

54
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,366
really strong elements
of each of these.

55
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,900
Now go back and bring them
together and come back to

56
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,833
me with a coherent strategy.

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
That was the model that
the members of Congress

58
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:59,400
who created the Solarium
Commission were looking to

59
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:05,800
try to bring coherence to
a strategic approach on

60
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,900
this very vital issue
of cybersecurity and

61
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:13,666
particularly around
looking at how we could

62
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,900
change bad actors'
behaviors in cyberspace.

63
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,966
We had the advantage right
off the bat of knowing

64
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,766
that we were not looking
at three distinct

65
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,266
approaches but that we
were going to be looking

66
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,233
at a blended approach, and
so that's what we started

67
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,000
out with right
off the bat.

68
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,366
>> MARK MONTGOMERY:
Thanks, Susanne.

69
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:36,333
That's great you brought
us from 1953 up to 2019;

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,633
2019 the Senator McCain
pushes through in the

71
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,599
National Defense
Authorization Act the

72
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,266
Cyberspace Solarium
Commission.

73
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,033
What threats, Frank, when
you look at this do you

74
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,132
think were most driving
the challenge that we had in

75
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,366
looking at the cyber threats
of significant consequence?

76
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,599
>> FRANK CILLUFFO:
Obviously, when you look

77
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,466
at the threat
spectrum, it is varied.

78
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,866
At the very top of the
list are nation states.

79
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,566
And not all nation states
are created equal.

80
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:08,033
Some, obviously, have
much more capability than

81
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,933
others, others have
greater intent, so it is

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,366
obviously a
mixed bag there.

83
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,233
Increasingly, we focused
on some of the nation

84
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,666
states' proxies, which
makes some of the

85
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,132
attribution issues we are
grappling with a little

86
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,899
more difficult.

87
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,100
Followed by criminal
enterprises, that you're

88
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,866
starting to see
capabilities that ten

89
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:31,766
years ago were only in the
handful of 5-6 nations.

90
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,699
Now some of those
capabilities are inside of

91
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,433
the hands of criminal
enterprises and the like,

92
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,933
foreign terrorist
organizations, and then

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,399
hacktivists, anyone
with an axe to grind.

94
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,966
But at the end of the
day, I think a lot of our

95
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,500
emphasis was looking at
nation state actors who

96
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:50,666
could genuinely change the
trajectory of our national

97
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,466
and economic security.

98
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,300
We needed to examine
exactly what made them

99
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:58,765
tick and also what are the
various instrumentalities

100
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,066
that can be brought to
bear to induce changes in

101
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,299
behavior, in our case,
positive behavior.

102
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:07,866
I think that a lot of the
emphasis is looking at the

103
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,800
high end of the threat
spectrum, but not at the

104
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,699
expense of other
threat actors.

105
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,399
They come in various
shapes, sizes, and forms.

106
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,133
But when you look at it
from a national security

107
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,166
perspective, obviously,
nation states, Russia,

108
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,199
China, Iran, North
Korea, the list goes on.

109
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,699
Basically, any country
with a modern military has

110
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,066
a cyber capability.

111
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:27,966
>> MARK MONTGOMERY:
Thanks.

112
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,233
You know, in reading
the National Defense

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,066
Authorization Act, it
clearly states that

114
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,332
understanding the
effectiveness of

115
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,466
deterrents in cyberspace
is a critical element of

116
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:39,300
the Commission.

117
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,599
Is deterrents - Chris,
is deterrents working?

118
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,933
>> CHRIS INGLIS: I think
as a Commission, we

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,666
concluded by consensus
that deterrents as

120
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,600
currently practices is not
working, but we further

121
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,666
concluded that it could.

122
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,533
And it is important to
distinguish between the

123
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,966
kind of deterrents that we
practiced in the nuclear

124
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,199
age when, as Will Hartnett
would say, it was offense

125
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,233
dominant and the goal
was to keep that weapon

126
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,100
off the field.

127
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,266
When it showed up,
it was game over.

128
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,166
In the current situation,
cyber, where cyber offense

129
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,800
is on the field
all the time.

130
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,099
Whether it is a criminal
or a bad practice on

131
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:14,000
behalf of an otherwise
honest insider or a nation

132
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,366
state, it is always going
to be - there is always

133
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,899
going to be a roil
somewhere in cyberspace.

134
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,766
But our view was that if
you put the elements of

135
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,333
classic deterrents
together in a

136
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,766
collaborative fashion,
where you get the

137
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,833
capability, the will,
the authority of a very

138
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,133
diverse group of
organizations, that

139
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,133
deterrents can work
because deterrents remains

140
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,366
what it has always been,
how do you change the

141
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,766
mindset of a potential
adversary to do something

142
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,633
that they would otherwise
do but for your actions.

143
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,500
And we can describe, if
you'd like, a little bit more

144
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,599
about what we then ultimately determined deterrents

145
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,600
should look like.

146
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,533
But we believed that it
wasn't working, and it can.

147
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,500
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: And
again, to be clear, as

148
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,899
Chris said, the test is
not have we come up with a

149
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,800
way to prevent a bad actor
from engaging in any

150
00:06:55,866 --> 00:07:00,332
malicious cyber activity,
but can we reduce that

151
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,833
level below the use of
forced threshold, which is

152
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,766
where we focused most of
our attention in sort of

153
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,066
the gray zone.

154
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,265
That's really the objective
that you're looking for.

155
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,899
>> CHRIS INGLIS: We firmly
believe that you can make

156
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,199
digital infrastructure
which we have to imagine

157
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,833
is not simply the
technology, but it is the

158
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,800
people, the roles,
responsibilities that are

159
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,199
connected to that.

160
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,266
We can make that
defensible and we can

161
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,533
defend it and we can
achieve the agility and

162
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,433
the maneuver and the
audacity as the defenders

163
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,833
that will crowdsource the
attackers in the same way

164
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,433
that they have been
doing that to us.

165
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,466
That's the fundamental
premise of what the report

166
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:35,866
is going to recommend.

167
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,566
To do that, we have actually taken the larger charge.

168
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,832
It is not a
Cybersecurity Commission.

169
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,133
It's a Cyber Commission.

170
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,033
We talk about all of
those elements of power

171
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,866
necessary to disrupt, to
defend, to deter across

172
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,033
the continuum of
cyber activity.

173
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,933
We don't mean to lead with
disruption, but ultimately

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
if the defense fails,
right, to make a

175
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,366
sufficient impact either
in the resilience or

176
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,332
robustness or in the
actual literal defense, it

177
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,933
is important to impose
consequences on

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,833
adversaries, and so we
cover all of those.

179
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,500
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Can I
touch on one point just

180
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,500
because the deterrent
question was central

181
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:11,666
to our work.

182
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:16,033
We must have discussed
it in 30 meetings.

183
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,899
That was always
front and center.

184
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,933
Just given the name
of this year's RSA

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,266
conference, the Human Element, the reality is is when we

186
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,866
start looking at cyber issues, technology changes.

187
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:32,066
The tactics, techniques,
procedures our adversaries

188
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,833
use, they're going to
continue to change, but

189
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,633
human nature remains
largely consistent.

190
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,166
It is looking at the
dynamics there and the

191
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:42,699
interface where we can
actually induce some

192
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,165
changes in behavior.

193
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,866
I think we all concluded,
not just the three of us

194
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,266
on the stage, that
deterrents as currently

195
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:57,500
envisioned is not - status
quo is just not cutting

196
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,866
it, but if we genuinely
get to the point where we

197
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,700
can unify and synchronize
some of our capabilities

198
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,199
because I think our
commission was a little

199
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,132
different than
many others.

200
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,033
Many come up with new
boxes and org charts.

201
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,000
They come up with a big
shiny new agency or department.

202
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,266
We did not.

203
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,399
Not because we were
incrementalist.

204
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:19,133
Rather, we were looking at
doubling down and building

205
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,399
up capacities that
currently exist, whether

206
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:26,033
at the Department of
Homeland Security or

207
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,733
enhancing FBI's reach
globally or enabling and

208
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,699
supporting the Department
of Defense and its defend

209
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,699
forward sorts
of initiatives.

210
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,565
When we look at
deterrents, it really is a

211
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:42,000
layered defense and
a layered level of deterrents.

212
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:47,100
And I think all of our
recommendations, the 70

213
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,533
somewhat recommendations
we have, which we winnowed

214
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,799
down dramatically, don't
make sense if you don't

215
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:57,100
get that strategic
component right up front.

216
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:01,333
That's not simply boxes
and org charts or throwing

217
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,100
money at a problem.

218
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,833
It is actually trying
to unify our various

219
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,633
instrumentalities to
get an outcome we hope.

220
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,000
>> CHRIS INGLIS: Following
on that, if you look at

221
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,000
the charge that was given
to the Commission by the

222
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,933
law in the summer of 2018,
it is hard not to come

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,666
away with a sense that
there was a bias, a

224
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,433
preference for the use of
military cyber power to

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,100
impose consequences on
adversaries who come with us.

226
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,100
It was coincident with the
declaration by the U.S.

227
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,733
Department of Defense that
we would defend forward.

228
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,665
The Commission, while
affirming that that's a

229
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,933
necessary component of
what the United States

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,066
should be prepared to do
and will do, it is one

231
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,433
instrument of power.

232
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,766
All of the other
instruments that are at

233
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,100
the disposal of the
government and the private

234
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,200
sector need to operate in
a similar fashion, early

235
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:48,233
discernment of a risk to
the collective enterprise,

236
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,866
early engagement, and
hopefully achieve the

237
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,833
highest possible leverage
in interdicting a threat

238
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,533
as it's on the rise.

239
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,966
Again, not simply using
government instruments of

240
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,500
power, which are
important, but private

241
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:02,866
sector instruments as well.

242
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,366
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Thanks.
That was a very detailed answer

243
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:10,000
to that question. I didn't
mention at the front, but one of

244
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,833
the unique aspects of this
Commission is that it has

245
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,233
four members who are
active members of Congress.

246
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,000
Suzanne, how has that
impacted the commission in

247
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,299
your thoughts?

248
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,633
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING:
Well, it was interesting.

249
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,666
I have been involved with
a lot of commissions.

250
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,465
I ran a couple and
have consulted with a

251
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,799
number of others.

252
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,233
This was really unique.

253
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,333
Actually, other
commissions have had had

254
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,366
sitting members of
Congress, but not

255
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,399
producing the kind of
result that we have here

256
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,200
which I'll touch
on in a minute.

257
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,233
The thing I think was
really unique was having

258
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,333
the executive branch
sitting on the Commission

259
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,066
as actual Commissioners
and present for every

260
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,500
meeting and fully engaged
in the conversations.

261
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:52,166
That made a
significant difference.

262
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:56,632
As was noted, commissions,
first of all, anybody who

263
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
thinks that a commission
is going to come up with

264
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,899
some really new idea no
one has ever thought of

265
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,333
before is bound to be
disappointed with every

266
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,033
commission because
it doesn't happen.

267
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,799
That's not what
it's about.

268
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:09,399
But a group of folks who
supposedly know something

269
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,033
and have sat through a lot
of briefings have come

270
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,066
together around a
consensus around ideas

271
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,966
that are out there that
they think are smart to

272
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,366
move forward with and
that's really the benefit

273
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,066
of the commission.

274
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,133
The second aspect is that
the commissions often -

275
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,866
they report lands and the
executive branch then fans

276
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,600
it out and they
have to familiarize

277
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,333
themselves with it.

278
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,666
That takes months.

279
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,799
Congress has to get up to
speed on it, et cetera.

280
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,899
And by the time things
start to move, you have

281
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,033
often come to the end of
the administration and

282
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,766
then things start all over
again with a new commission.

283
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,933
Having the executive
branch on there means that

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,466
they are already informed.

285
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,200
They know exactly and
how we got where we got.

286
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:55,433
It made the decision
to not take a blue sky

287
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,533
aspirational approach that
was not realistic but

288
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,566
instead to focus on what
is achievable, much more

289
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,500
meaningful, because we had
folks at the table who

290
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,833
could tell us what was
achievable and what was not.

291
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,600
And then the members
of Congress were very

292
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,666
interested in making sure
that things would not just

293
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:18,366
fall on somebody's desk
but actually be achieved.

294
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:21,266
And so a unique aspect of
this report that I think

295
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,132
we can preview is that it
will have an annex

296
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,033
that is a series of
legislative recommendations,

297
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,833
pieces of legislation.

298
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,466
So not just making a
recommendation that

299
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,700
Congress should do X, but
actually providing draft

300
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,233
legislation that the staff
has been working with

301
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,733
lawyers on to help jump
start the conversations

302
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,933
and get this moving.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,866
Many, many of our
recommendations have led

304
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,566
to these legislative
proposals, and we have the

305
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,666
members of Congress who
are passionate about it

306
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,266
who can help
shepherd it through.

307
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,500
>> CHRIS INGLIS: Mark, if
I might add, what was also

308
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,433
different from the
original Solarium circa

309
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,833
1953 and this one was that
the private sector was in

310
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:02,799
the room as well.

311
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:05,733
Tom Fanning who is the CEO
of Southern Corporation,

312
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,466
Southern Company - I think
it's the largest or the

313
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,433
second largest electrical
grid within the United

314
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,600
States - he was a
commissioner and he showed

315
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,500
up just about
every single time.

316
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,433
He was fully
engaged in that.

317
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
We engaged upwards of a
dozen foreign nations who

318
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,500
all had various
strategies, some ahead of

319
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,333
ours in terms of the
sophistication, the

320
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,466
applicability to
our own problems.

321
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,133
We engaged academia.

322
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,566
We engaged the private
sector through various

323
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:33,100
whether it was through
ISACS which are already

324
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,700
well organized along
the critical sectors or

325
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:38,866
whether it was Consortia
organized for us by kind

326
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:39,899
of entities like the U.S.

327
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,200
Chamber of Commerce.

328
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,933
And across the main,
probably upwards of 200

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,166
engagements - I'm guessing
at that, but probably in

330
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,933
the right ballpark - 30
close in meetings such

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,133
that we were at least as
well informed as we could

332
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
possibly be about what the
art of the possible was.

333
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,199
Our job was not to come
up with the new ideas.

334
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,899
They were already on the
table kind of offered by

335
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,299
that fairly robust and
diverse group of people.

336
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,665
Our job was to figure
out how do you actually

337
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,899
integrate them into some
fabric so that you can

338
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,200
then achieve some degree
of integration and,

339
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,366
hopefully in the human
dimension, collaboration.

340
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,633
Those, I think, would be
the Hallmarks of success

341
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,466
for us is that we
actually bring all of the

342
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,433
capabilities, all of the
authorities, all of the

343
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,033
talent to bear against
what increasingly is a

344
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,666
common problem, unlike the
nuclear problem of 1953

345
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,733
which required an
industrial base but

346
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,632
largely handled by
the executive branch.

347
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,200
This is different.

348
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,065
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Just
one minor last point

349
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,933
because I know we
want to move on.

350
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,399
One of the things that I
found enlightening, it was

351
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:41,566
the least partisan room I
had been in every week in

352
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:46,533
Washington D.C. It is
amazing when people work

353
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,100
the way we should how
ideas can actually get

354
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,566
addressed, grappled with.

355
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't kid ourselves here.

356
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:55,799
We didn't agree.

357
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,433
We came from very
different places in the

358
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,399
beginning, but it was a
very constructive manner

359
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:04,533
and fashion and I just
don't think there is

360
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,766
enough of that these days.

361
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,100
I just had to throw
that in there.

362
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,933
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Chris,
picking up on what you

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,533
were talking about,
strategic deterrents,

364
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,733
going forward, how would
you describe the layered

365
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,699
deterrent strategy that's
discussed in the report?

366
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:22,966
>> CHRIS INGLIS: When you
pick up the report and

367
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,366
read it, 11 March, coming
to a town near you, you

368
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,299
will see early on that
there is a discussion of

369
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,233
what we describe as
layered deterrents.

370
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,766
It's actually
not a new idea.

371
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,333
It borrows heavily from
some fairly good work

372
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,133
that's out there, both
from the nuclear arena and

373
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,566
increasingly in
the cyber arena.

374
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,200
But it basically describes
three layers which are

375
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,899
applied concurrently.

376
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,933
They actually have some
degree of dependence.

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,666
It is our view that you
needed to do one of them

378
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,299
before you do the others,
but you need to do them

379
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,899
all at the same time.

380
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,666
The first is to
essentially shape the

381
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,500
environment.

382
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,633
You do that by essentially
working holistically

383
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,033
across the government,
across the government and

384
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,799
private sector, and with
allies or like-minded

385
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,733
nations to create your
expectation of what should

386
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,965
be the appropriate
standard of behavior in

387
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:09,165
cyberspace, what perhaps
are thresholds, maybe not

388
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,233
redlines, but thresholds
that describe what is

389
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,833
permitted, what
is not permitted.

390
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,166
What are the right
remedies for that?

391
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,733
What are the right roles
and responsibilities

392
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,598
across that?

393
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:19,399
But you need to first
shape all of those

394
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:20,199
expectations.

395
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,299
The second is you
then need to make the

396
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,098
infrastructure, the
digital infrastructure,

397
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,399
again, which includes
people and the definition

398
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,000
of roles and
responsibilities, you need

399
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:30,000
to make that defensible,
you need to make it

400
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,533
resilient and robust.

401
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,166
There is a broad set of
actions that we recommend

402
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,265
to do that holistically
across all the

403
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,066
participants in the supply
chain that creates,

404
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,233
develops, operates
digital infrastructure.

405
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,066
Then third, you need to be
willing to impose cost.

406
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,066
Right?

407
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,299
That's the third kind of activity that you undertake.

408
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,500
When the first two fail,
people haven't read the

409
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:52,766
rules and say I intend
to operate differently.

410
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,500
They're not intimidated
by the denied benefits

411
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,033
portion which says that
we're going to make it

412
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,099
hard for you to be a
miscreant in this space.

413
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,066
They do it anyway, you
need to be willing, able, and

414
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,766
you need to deliver in terms of holding them accountable.

415
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,833
Now, the most titillating
part of the report is

416
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,166
likely to be this
imposed cost.

417
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,233
How do you impose cost
on an adversary in that

418
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,900
space, particularly when
it is a nation state that

419
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:17,966
has been unchecked, kind
of unbowed for the last

420
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,000
10-15 years?

421
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,200
You can imagine who we
might mention in that regard.

422
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,733
While that's the most
titillating, we think that

423
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,966
that necessarily stands
on the foundation of

424
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,033
the first two.

425
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,033
If you haven't actually
shaped expectations, if

426
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,500
you haven't made the kind
of digital infrastructure

427
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:34,700
defensible, then you have
no business disrupting

428
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:36,966
because you live in a
glass house and that's

429
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,166
going to come quickly back
to create chaos, disorder,

430
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,366
indiscipline for
your own side.

431
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,000
You are all living in
the common environment.

432
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,266
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: Yeah. I think it is interesting looking

433
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,233
back on the progression
of the conversations among the

434
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,799
commissioners without
getting into closed door

435
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:58,433
conversations or revealing
any sensitive information.

436
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,333
But I think if you read
the language of the

437
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,133
National Defense
Authorization Act setting

438
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,166
the Solarium up and then
those first few meetings,

439
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:10,366
there was a real focus
on imposing costs.

440
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,333
Right?

441
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,733
The real frustration that
our - that the bad actors

442
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,766
have been getting away
with stuff for too long

443
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,200
without any consequences
and that's really where we

444
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,700
need to focus our
efforts and our energy.

445
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:24,133
We did - there is a fair
amount of that in the report.

446
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,966
But I will say when you
look at the report, you

447
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:31,765
will see that what really
kind of dominates and I

448
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,033
think has more set of
pride of place in the

449
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,366
report, not surprisingly,
is the resilience.

450
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:38,700
It is the deny benefits.

451
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:39,900
Right?

452
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:43,399
As you're trying to alter
your bad actors' behavior,

453
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:46,533
you want to both raise the
cost but also reduce their

454
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,832
sense of what they're going
to be able to accomplish.

455
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,566
So that resilience,
that incorporates defense,

456
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,766
but also, again,
incorporates the ability to

457
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,566
mitigate the consequences.

458
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,766
We talk a lot
about threat.

459
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,833
The ecosystem discussion
is a lot about vulnerability.

460
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,200
But the resilience is
really about consequences.

461
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,299
It's about understanding
what the consequences are

462
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,900
in the real world, not
just to computers, and all

463
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,299
the ways we can mitigate,
including analogue

464
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:22,900
solutions, including paper
ballots and hand cranks

465
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:30,233
and things like that on
the assumption that we

466
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,133
will not be able to
prevent activity.

467
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,500
The ability to limit the
consequences that the

468
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:41,299
adversary can achieve, we
believe, can alter the

469
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,866
adversary's calculations
in the long run.

470
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,000
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: And
just to underscore one point.

471
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,700
These aren't either/or
propositions.

472
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:51,033
It is all of the above
because the original

473
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,566
defend forward concept
came from the 2018

474
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:56,900
Department of Defense
strategy which we

475
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:01,233
endorsed, but it doesn't
get to the whole set of

476
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,633
issues that we
need to get to.

477
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,666
And where we look at
defend forward very

478
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,966
specifically, it is all
instruments of power, all

479
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,799
instruments of government,
whether it is a law

480
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:12,700
enforcement, whether it's
a market-driven, whether

481
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:16,633
it is - and different
actors are actually part

482
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,500
of including the
private sector.

483
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:23,033
We genuinely tried to go
beyond the same old, same

484
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,633
old, identify the problem
and talk about the

485
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,266
public-private
partnership, but really to

486
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,400
translate some of those
nouns into verbs and

487
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:33,399
really understand how we
can move from where we

488
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:36,733
want to be - from where we
are to where we want to be.

489
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,500
That was a big emphasis.

490
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:42,099
And you will see a number
of findings along those lines.

491
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,666
>> MARK MONTGOMERY:
Suzanne, you had

492
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,700
mentioned, in resilience,
paper ballots.

493
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:50,333
So does the resilience
include election security?

494
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,866
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: It does. And it includes beyond just

495
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,566
the resilience of our
infrastructure itself,

496
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:59,900
the idea of a resilient society, right, of a resilient public,

497
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:02,632
which I think is
particularly important

498
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,333
in the election context.

499
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,266
We got a little bit
into the particularly

500
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:11,433
cyber-enabled information
operations and the things

501
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,099
that can be done
in that realm.

502
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,066
But probably the most
important thing that can

503
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,000
be done in that realm is
to have a public that is

504
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,400
more resilient to
pernicious messaging, and

505
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,265
so we've got some
recommendations along

506
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,333
those lines as well.

507
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,233
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Thanks.

508
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,933
So, Frank, I haven't heard
anything yet about the U.S.

509
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
government itself.

510
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,166
Was the Commission or the
report able to comment on

511
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:39,200
or make recommendations on
the organization of the

512
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,733
U.S. government?

513
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,599
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: We have
dozens of recommendations,

514
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,866
but we're not going to
share them all right now.

515
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:47,900
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: Or any.

516
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,399
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Yes. Or any.

517
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:52,866
The reality, we did
look at a whole host of

518
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:55,833
different - both ends of
Pennsylvania Avenue, so

519
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,266
both in terms of how the
executive branch and

520
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,333
executive agencies can
better get their act

521
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,433
together, how they can be
better partners with the

522
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,333
private sector, how they
can work better with our

523
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,066
allies overseas, as well
as looking at how Congress

524
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:16,533
and the various committees
that have jurisdictional

525
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,599
bits and pieces of cyber,
how that can be enhanced.

526
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,799
Therein lies the real
issue is it touches

527
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:27,966
everything in one
fashion or another.

528
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,265
If you're thinking in a
military sense, I don't

529
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,666
think you will have any
conflict going forward

530
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,265
that doesn't have a cyber
component or element to

531
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,266
it, whether it is
intelligence preparation

532
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,866
on the battlefield or
whether it is a computer

533
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:43,099
network attack in
combination with the

534
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,500
traditional or kinetic
instrumentalities of warfare.

535
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:48,933
That's what makes
this vexing.

536
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,900
You will have a series of
recommendations in terms

537
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,966
of how the executive
branch can better unify

538
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,265
some of its capabilities.

539
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,066
You're going to see some
real emphasis on doubling

540
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:05,233
down and enhancing certain
agencies' capabilities

541
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,299
right now.

542
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:09,633
Sometimes I think we
over complicate this.

543
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,433
At the end of the day, it
is really how do we get

544
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,033
FBI, NSA, DOD, and DHS,
how does that triad all

545
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:18,933
come together?

546
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,566
We spent a lot of time
looking at ways to enhance

547
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:25,433
that synchronization.

548
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,766
And then on the
legislative branch, the

549
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,566
fact that you have members
of Congress, none of whom

550
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:33,433
shared their first
opinions, but will be

551
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,766
coming down with some very
strong recommendations

552
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,266
along those lines.

553
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,500
>> CHRIS INGLIS: What I
found interesting about

554
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,799
all of that is that most
of those recommendations

555
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,933
were shaped not so much by
the views of the party to

556
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,400
be changed, but rather the
party that actually had a

557
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,699
relationship with them.

558
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:51,733
For example, we asked the
private sector if we were

559
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,099
to propose as a federal
government that we would

560
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,433
have a meaningful
real-time collaboration

561
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,566
with you, how
might that work?

562
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,533
For starters, you're not
joined up yourselves.

563
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,933
You're not very coherent.

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,066
The capability will.

565
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,966
Authority doesn't show up
in the private sector's

566
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,832
view within the federal
government in the same

567
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,400
place, you need
to fix that.

568
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,666
You need to make it such
that when we deal with the

569
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,666
government, we don't have
to run pillar to post to

570
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,533
figure out which part of
the government we're going

571
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,599
to deal with or how the
government actually

572
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,566
commits and exercises its
proactive defense of us in

573
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:21,900
the private sector.

574
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,933
Two, the private sector
said to the federal

575
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,466
government, you need to be considerably more proactive.

576
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:29,699
It's sometimes episodic,
and perhaps it is a heavy

577
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,933
bias towards those things
that are perhaps the

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,266
muscle well developed,
less so the ones that are not.

579
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,900
You need to figure out how
do you bring all of your

580
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,966
instruments up to the
line and join us in this

581
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,099
collaboration to
co-discover and

582
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,765
co-mitigate activities in
this space that beleaguer

583
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,900
all of us.

584
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,265
And so when we
walked through these

585
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,233
recommendations, similarly
for the congressional for

586
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,099
the legislative branch, it
was largely the executive

587
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,733
branch that essentially
was able to inform here is

588
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,433
how you could provide
better oversight on this,

589
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,433
here is how to make that
more coherent, more

590
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,433
effective, more focused,
such that we then think

591
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,766
that we have got something
that's not simply

592
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,599
acceptable, maybe yes or
no, to the party to be

593
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,265
changed, but useful to the
parties that will then be

594
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,266
engaged by or to
essentially engage those

595
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,333
parties that will change.

596
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,466
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Thanks.

597
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,565
So Frank, when - one of
the industries that you

598
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:22,766
kind of hear being both
simultaneously vilified

599
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,666
and longed for is the
cyber insurance industry.

600
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,399
As you went through this,
were there things the

601
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:31,666
Commission learned about
cyber insurance or

602
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:35,399
thoughts they have about
how to address that industry?

603
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,065
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Yeah.

604
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:39,099
We did tackle the
insurance question.

605
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:45,066
I think there are varied
views on how effective it

606
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:49,766
is now and certainly a lot
of perspectives on how we

607
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:54,033
can recalibrate it to make it more effective going forward.

608
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,633
And when you say
insurance, because you

609
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,500
want to - if you can get
to market-driven forces to

610
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,633
help drive some of these
solutions, that should be

611
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,533
the default point.

612
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,466
That should be the
starting point.

613
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:11,065
Right now, I think there
is more that needs to be

614
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,299
done to enhance the
existing coverage and

615
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,366
capacity to get to the
point where we all want to be.

616
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:22,700
Insurance needs to be
looked at in a more broad

617
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:27,233
set of industry issues,
whether it's the

618
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,966
continuity of the economy,
these sorts of questions.

619
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,099
But, yeah.

620
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,299
We're going to come up
with a hand - a couple

621
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:36,666
of findings very
specifically on ways to

622
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,299
enhance that capability.

623
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,733
Suzanne, do you want to
draw on that because

624
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,700
you've shared a
lot of thoughts.

625
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,866
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: As
Frank says, it came up

626
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,599
really in the context of
the conversation about

627
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,033
both how do we shape the ecosystem and build resilience.

628
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:57,299
What you ideally - as much
as possible, you want to

629
00:27:57,366 --> 00:28:00,500
use the market to shape
behavior and to drive the

630
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,733
kinds of investments
and changes in behavior

631
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,433
that you want.

632
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,866
So you start by looking
at what would a perfectly

633
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:13,099
functioning market
incentivize?

634
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,666
What kinds of behaviors
would - if all of the

635
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:18,533
private sector and other
critical infrastructure

636
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,099
owners and operators had
perfect information to

637
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,533
manage their risk, what
kinds of things would they do?

638
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,666
Where is the gap between
that and what they are doing?

639
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:28,733
Why is that?

640
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,900
Why is the market not
achieving what we would

641
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,166
like it to achieve?

642
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,799
We looked at a number
of different kinds of

643
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:38,333
incentives and ways to
improve the market.

644
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,133
Cyber insurance is
clearly one of them.

645
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,333
Insurance plays this role
in other contexts as we

646
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,933
know to incentivize and
help provide guidance and

647
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,333
incentives for appropriate
security investments.

648
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,099
So we looked very
carefully at how we could

649
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:55,566
improve that function
for cyber insurance.

650
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,266
But we looked at other
market incentives and

651
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,366
drivers as well.

652
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:03,766
And then you have to
understand, at the end of

653
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:06,299
the day, there is going to
be some delta in critical

654
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:07,633
infrastructure,
particularly where there

655
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,299
is a public interest that
exceeds anything that

656
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,900
could be reasonably asked
of the private sector to do.

657
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:20,233
In that context, again, we
looked at, okay, are these

658
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,766
situations in which we
should compensate the

659
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,666
private sector?

660
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,866
The private sector is in
the best position to do

661
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,000
something that we need
done to achieve our

662
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:33,133
strategic goal, but it is
not really something they

663
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,666
would normally be asked
to do, defend against a

664
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,332
nation state adversary in
a certain context, and so

665
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,833
should we compensate them?

666
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,033
If so, how do we avoid
the moral hazard?

667
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,765
Right?

668
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:47,633
Are there - do we need to
provide - we looked at both

669
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,400
carrots and sticks, regulatory approaches, requirements.

670
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:53,166
One of the boldest
things I think that the

671
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:56,933
Commission did was to
acknowledge explicitly

672
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,200
that while - I'm from
DHS where I was the

673
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,866
undersecretary for
critical infrastructure

674
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,200
and cybersecurity, and
there are 16 sectors and

675
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,533
we love them all dearly.

676
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,799
All of them are really
important to our effort.

677
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:13,633
But when you're looking at
what is nationally - from

678
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,966
a national strategic
perspective, you have to

679
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,966
prioritize your efforts.

680
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,565
Some are going to be more
equal than others, right,

681
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:22,599
in the private sector.

682
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,133
That's a surprisingly bold
thing for certainly a

683
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,933
government or a
quasi-governmental

684
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,599
entity to say.

685
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,765
Can you prioritize
resources?

686
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,799
Can you make -
impose additional

687
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,133
responsibility on them?

688
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,799
Those were some of the
things we looked at.

689
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,966
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Can I
just put one fine point on

690
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,599
that because I think
that's really important.

691
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,066
We really - if everything
is critical - in reality,

692
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,200
nothing is critical - we
did try to get to the

693
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:47,599
racking and stacking.

694
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,466
That is important.

695
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,366
It is not to suggest that
anything isn't already

696
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,533
important, but some are
lifeline sectors and some

697
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,866
of those are more critical
to our national security,

698
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:00,733
our economic security, and
our health and wellbeing.

699
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,833
But we also looked at
it through the national

700
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,266
critical functions that
CIS and DHS is looking at

701
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,000
that don't fit neatly in
one of the 16 critical

702
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:16,500
infrastructure areas,
which if there were a

703
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:18,266
disruptive and/or
destructive attack, it

704
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,599
would be debilitating to our national and economic security.

705
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,933
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: That cross-sector interdependent.

706
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,866
>> FRED CILLUFFO:
That's the combo. Exactly.

707
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,966
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Before
we go to public questions

708
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:32,733
and answers, I have one
more ask for Chris.

709
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,833
We have talked a lot about
- all three commissioners

710
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,799
here have mentioned the
public-private, the

711
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:40,466
importance of the private
sector in this initiative.

712
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,733
Is there a role in
the report for our

713
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,366
relationship with
international partners?

714
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,033
If so, what kind of
issues are we looking at?

715
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:49,899
>> CHRIS INGLIS:
Absolutely.

716
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:53,299
In that first kind of
component of the layered

717
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:55,599
defense when we talk about
shaping the ecosystem, we

718
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:58,133
quite explicitly talk
about the need to do that

719
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,466
not simply between the
private and public sector

720
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,866
within the United
States but across

721
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,500
governments pleural.

722
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:06,000
We need their assistance
to influence what we

723
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,333
believe are the normative
behaviors in that space.

724
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,833
A lot of that work has
already been done.

725
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,133
We need to affirm it.

726
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,133
We need their assistance
to understand how do we

727
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,033
put groups of people
together across national

728
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:17,700
boundaries, because that's
the way cyber really

729
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:21,400
works, to co-discover and
co-mitigate threats in an

730
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:23,033
international context.

731
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,233
We think it makes the
alliance all the stronger

732
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,900
if we have more member of
that alliance essentially

733
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:30,265
kind of declaring what
constitutes normal

734
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,733
behavior, declaring what
we're going to do to make

735
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,200
it resilience and robust,
and essentially kind of

736
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:38,033
foreswearing or committing
our collective efforts to

737
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,066
hold adversaries in
that space at risk.

738
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,733
So whether it is in the
strategy formulation or

739
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,500
the operational execution,
there must be a very

740
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:48,266
strong role for
international partners.

741
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,433
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: We
think of our international

742
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,033
partners as one of our
instruments of power, if

743
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,799
you will, the fact that
we have these strong alliances.

744
00:32:56,866 --> 00:33:00,866
And so as we endorse the
notion of defend forward,

745
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:03,666
of persistent engagement,
where we're going to try

746
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:09,765
to engage the adversary
between us and space,

747
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,000
between us and them,
that's often going to be

748
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:16,833
our ally's space.

749
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,900
So we are very clear in
the report about the need

750
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,966
to make sure that we
are engaged in robust

751
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,500
consultation and
conversations with our

752
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:29,666
allies so that we aren't
doing something that

753
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:32,799
ultimately erodes that key
instrument of national

754
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,400
power, which is our strong
alliances and our ability

755
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:37,332
to operate together.

756
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,033
That becomes a
norm of behavior.

757
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,399
>> CHRIS INGLIS: Mark,
I know we want to go to

758
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:42,733
questions, but it
might be useful.

759
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,533
I know that we have been
somewhat perhaps avoiding

760
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,966
the question of what
specifically is in the report.

761
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,000
It is not going to be
released formally until

762
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,000
the 11th of March, but I
could just showcase it

763
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,200
this way or perhaps
thumbnail sketch it this way.

764
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,599
You will read, of course,
a case for action right up

765
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,633
front, after the necessary
administration about why

766
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000
we put the
commission together.

767
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:03,866
There will be a case for
action, a very strong, I

768
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,033
think, case for action.

769
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,165
You will then kind of read
the Commission's summary

770
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:10,566
statement of while we
don't think that the

771
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,565
collective approach has
been working, deterrents

772
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:14,698
has not been working, kind
of order and discipline is

773
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:18,199
actually kind of fading
away in cyberspace, our

774
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,933
kind of declared intent to
essentially put together a

775
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,433
set of recommendations
that say that we can, in

776
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,466
fact, deter adversaries
in this space, we can, in

777
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:29,033
fact, achieve a defensible
proposition that we

778
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,500
then can defend.

779
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,732
And to Suzanne's earlier
point, we're never going

780
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,433
to have the peace and
tranquility we would

781
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,666
prefer, but we can
essentially use cyberspace

782
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,099
for our purposes,
crowdsourcing adversaries

783
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,866
in a way that we'd
not done before.

784
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,033
There will then be the
kind of layered defense

785
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:45,466
description, three broad
lines of effort, and then

786
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,299
six very specific pillars
that say and here's how

787
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,699
then to implement that.

788
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:53,199
About 75 actions in all
across those six pillars,

789
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,199
which won't surprise you
in terms of how we then

790
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,433
decompose kind
of the layers.

791
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,366
And then about 40 to 45 of
those actions will have

792
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,566
actually a legislative
component and there will

793
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,566
then be legislative
language in an appendix

794
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:08,466
that says if you would
want to legislatively

795
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:10,598
either change the
authorities or resource

796
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,166
this or to kind of
construct some additional

797
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,766
permissions or kind
of incentives or cost

798
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,033
impositions, here's the
legislative language that

799
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,599
can do that, and we hope
that that will be executed

800
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,500
within short order, within
the single legislative

801
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,698
year that's ahead of us.

802
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:28,033
>> MARK MONTGOMERY:
Thanks.

803
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,466
We have two microphones
right here if anyone wants

804
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:31,966
to come up and
ask questions.

805
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,566
I do see mid shipment
in the audience.

806
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,732
If they want to take on a
naval academy professor,

807
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,500
feel free.

808
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:41,000
But otherwise, we'll pass
the first question here.

809
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:41,799
>> AUDIENCE: Hi.

810
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,366
I actually have
two questions.

811
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:48,066
The first one is just
about after the report is

812
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,066
released on March 11,
what is the role of the

813
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,299
Solarium post report?

814
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:56,633
And then the second one is
have you guys examined - I

815
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,500
know you can't talk
specifically about

816
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:04,165
different elements of the
report, but can you speak

817
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:08,166
to whether or not
you will provide any

818
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,900
recommendations regarding
funding for different

819
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,366
cybersecurity efforts?

820
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:14,666
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: You
want to start with, Mark,

821
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:18,033
maybe what happens
next administratively?

822
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,166
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Yeah.

823
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,533
As the Executive Director,
I will say that what

824
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,900
happens after a commission
report is delivered is we

825
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:25,466
have a set of hearings
with House and Senate

826
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:28,732
armed services and the
House and Senate Homeland

827
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,566
Security and then
briefings with the

828
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,165
intelligence Committees.

829
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:37,400
And then a lot of - there
will be about eight think

830
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:40,500
tank events, similar to
this one, with two to

831
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,098
three Commissioners
talking about specific

832
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,500
areas that are relevant
to that think tank.

833
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,566
And then a lot
of outreach.

834
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:51,232
You know, Chris mentioned
that we had about 300

835
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,466
meetings with the
private sector and

836
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:56,000
non-governmental
organizations.

837
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,866
We'll go back out to those
300 organizations and

838
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,966
feedback what we had heard
from them and what we're

839
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:05,699
giving back - what they
said to us and how it

840
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,566
reflected in the report.

841
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,765
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: And,
Mark, there is some talk

842
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,699
about re-evaluating to
make sure - not a report

843
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:13,533
card, per se.

844
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,833
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: It
will probably take - I

845
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,133
think eventually the
Congress will take a look

846
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,566
at how you assess
implementation of

847
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:20,566
things like this.

848
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:25,265
We did that for the national defense strategy recently.

849
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,166
And if you look at
the Blair report on

850
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:28,800
intellectual - the
Commission on Intellectual

851
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:33,166
Property, it had several
iterations as it studied

852
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:37,699
the deeper and deeper
effects of foreign nation

853
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,933
intellectual property
theft on the United States.

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,666
>> CHRIS INGLIS: To the
last question, we do have

855
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,800
recommendations in there that account for resourcing.

856
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:49,766
We tried not to bankrupt
the democracy, but at the

857
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,199
same time we think
resources are important.

858
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:54,033
We kind of looked at the
actions to determine

859
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,966
whether they were
actionable, and

860
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:58,232
classically there are
three reasons why they're not.

861
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,833
One is, upon receipt,
somebody says it is a bad

862
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,199
idea, never heard of this
before, not invented here.

863
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:05,766
We worked very hard
actually to sufficiently

864
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,033
inform these
recommendations that the

865
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,500
party that was most likely
to get the recommendation

866
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:11,598
wouldn't say that's just
the dumbest thing I've

867
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,500
ever heard of.

868
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:13,533
Right?

869
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,533
Now it might still happen,
but we worked hard not to

870
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,833
let that happen.

871
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,800
Two, someone would look at
it and say I don't have

872
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:20,866
the authority to do that.

873
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:22,400
So there is some
legislative relief in

874
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,699
there that either makes it
permissible or, in some

875
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:28,433
cases, expected and
compelled that we will do

876
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,433
these things.

877
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Three, oftentimes resource
is the thing that lags.

878
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:35,466
Look, I have only got
three people and a small dog.

879
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,732
I can't do all of the
things you've asked me to do.

880
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,566
You have to account for
that so that you can get

881
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,765
past this problem of what
are the reasons why we

882
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:47,266
wouldn't action some of these kinds of recommendations.

883
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,733
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Policy
without resources is rhetoric.

884
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
We recognize that.

885
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:56,165
We did identify some areas
in terms of resources,

886
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,866
plus-ups that are needed.

887
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,966
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING:
I will say, I rebelled

888
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,566
initially at the
recommendations that we

889
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,732
had in there for
increased funding.

890
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,333
In earlier commissions
that I had been involved

891
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,633
with, there was sort of a
general feeling that we're

892
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,099
not going to make any
recommendations to

893
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,566
increase resources because
that's such a copout, it

894
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:16,066
is an easy thing to do,
and it's not going to happen.

895
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:21,000
I got over it because in
this area of countering

896
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:24,133
malicious cyber activity,
we are so dramatically

897
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,800
under resourced
across the board.

898
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,433
So, yes, there are
funding recommendations.

899
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,633
>> AUDIENCE: Okay.

900
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:34,033
I'll start by just
thanking the commissioners

901
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:35,666
for all their hard work
because I know you guys

902
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,533
busted your butts going
out and talking to private

903
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,733
sector and coming to talk
to government and all

904
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,366
of that stuff.

905
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:41,966
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING:
Mostly the staff.

906
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,833
>> AUDIENCE:
Thank you, staff.

907
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,233
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: And the
staff has been phenomenal,

908
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,366
so Mark and some
of the team.

909
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:47,699
Thank you.

910
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,966
>> AUDIENCE: I would like
to ask specifically about

911
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:52,966
to have an effective
layered deterrent, your

912
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:57,133
adversary needs to know
that you're deterring them.

913
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,266
There is some degree of notion of awareness or visibility.

914
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,400
There is a lot of
obstacles to that

915
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,000
visibility today.

916
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,732
I'm looking at it from the
NSA side, and then private

917
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,333
sector has their
visibility, and we all

918
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,066
have our own niches.

919
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:14,000
Did you guys discuss that
and how we can come to a

920
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:16,866
more unified visibility
of our cyber space?

921
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,533
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: Can I
jump - that's an

922
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,699
excellent question.

923
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:22,166
Quite honestly, firstly,
you deter actors,

924
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,900
not a thing anyway.

925
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,500
What works for Russia may
not work for China, Iran,

926
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:30,299
North Korea, on
the list goes.

927
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:31,166
Well said.

928
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:36,000
But, yes, we are very
forward leaning in terms

929
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:41,066
of the need to articulate
publicly and transparently

930
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,633
what our deterrent
strategy would be because

931
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,300
sometimes we may think
we're deterring and the

932
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,366
signaling may
not be clear.

933
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,766
What we don't want
to do is unintentionally

934
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,400
lead to escalation.

935
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:56,433
The way to do that is to
be more visible and not

936
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,199
hide behind our
capabilities, not flaunt

937
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:02,699
our capabilities, but
genuinely put them on the

938
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,099
table and this is
the consequence.

939
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:09,666
I think you will find that
is central to our layered

940
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,633
deterrent strategy because
right now it is not only

941
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,599
how you respond to a
particular incident, and

942
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,333
we can't let episodes
define our strategy which

943
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,466
has largely been where we
are in the past few years,

944
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:26,466
not few years, past decades
on some of these issues.

945
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,466
We do need to get to the
point where we can be

946
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,333
transparent, we can
articulate it, and we

947
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,266
can't hide behind our
capability, which means we

948
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,500
better have the
wherewithal to act when

949
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:37,933
something occurs and I
think that there is full

950
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,833
agreement on the
commission that that's

951
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,833
where we need to be.

952
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,966
>> CHRIS INGLIS: If I
could add to transparency,

953
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,199
timeliness. Right?

954
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:46,966
An adversary needs to know
that the consequence of

955
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:50,500
the action that they took
in a timely way, right, is

956
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,598
explicitly aimed at them.

957
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:55,633
So it is more important
for us to sometimes be

958
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:58,300
very timely about you do
A, you're going to smack

959
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:00,533
your hand, if you do
B, you're going to

960
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,866
essentially encounter
something immediately, so

961
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:04,966
that there is no ambiguity
about what that kind of

962
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:07,033
action, consequence
might have been.

963
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:09,866
>> AUDIENCE: Thanks.

964
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,099
>> AUDIENCE: When you were
looking at what foreign

965
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,133
governments are doing to
protect their private

966
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,533
businesses, did you find
that the European Union

967
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,033
was providing money to
private industry to

968
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,166
bolster their cyber
security, and did you find

969
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:30,666
that GDPR was improving
their cyber hygiene in

970
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,900
those countries?

971
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:37,833
>> CHRIS INGLIS:
I'll start.

972
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,433
We looked at the European
Union, or Europe, right?

973
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,400
It turns out that there
are a couple of ways to

974
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:42,400
kind of skin the cat.

975
00:42:42,466 --> 00:42:45,598
The European Union has a
cyber security agency and

976
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,666
they have done some useful
work to try to harmonize -

977
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,199
that might not be exactly
the right word - but to

978
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:52,933
rationalize across the
various nation states what

979
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,333
their expectations are,
how they collaborate

980
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,633
across governments and
between the government and

981
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:58,733
the private sector.

982
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
The nation states, of
course, they all have

983
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:05,099
differing views that
perhaps might individually

984
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,933
be embraced and used, and
therefore they bring that

985
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,800
to bear, and all of
them have spoken, to my

986
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:11,933
understanding,
about privacy.

987
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,199
The EU in particular has
spoken through the lens of GDPR.

988
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:18,300
The member nations,
essentially, then had to

989
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:19,300
pick that up.

990
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:21,699
But each of them has then
kind of a particular

991
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,233
implementation within
their nation state that

992
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,400
essentially accentuates
or extends that.

993
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:30,566
We tried to understand
all of that.

994
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,966
We didn't perhaps
rationalize or reconcile

995
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:35,000
that entirely to the
United States because we

996
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:37,332
have 56 states
and territories.

997
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,633
We make that look
simple by design.

998
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:41,599
But we did think that
it was important to

999
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,400
harmonize, right, whether
it is privacy, or breach

1000
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:46,900
notification, or
expectations about what

1001
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:48,400
reasonable, normal
behavior is.

1002
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:50,699
It is important to
rationalize that, so that

1003
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:52,766
if you're a company or an
individual that has to

1004
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,699
operate across those
boundaries, right, you

1005
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,800
essentially know what the
rule is, and hopefully it

1006
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:01,166
is one rule or one coda as
opposed to any number of

1007
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:03,800
different jurisdictions
that you have to respond to.

1008
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,300
Suzanne.

1009
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:06,633
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: Yeah. No.

1010
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:07,633
I think that's
exactly right.

1011
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:10,099
You know, GDPR has a
number of sort of pros and

1012
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:10,933
cons to it.

1013
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,133
Certainly, one of the
things that it did was

1014
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,933
establish a
common framework.

1015
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,099
That was something we very
much took to heart as we

1016
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:22,666
looked at national policies inside of the United States.

1017
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:26,066
>> FRANK CILLUFFO: We did
reach out and heard from a

1018
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:29,198
number of the European
countries and the leads

1019
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,433
for cyber,
including today.

1020
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,066
I think the jury is out,
not wearing my commission

1021
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:38,832
hat, on the efficacy
of GDPR at this point.

1022
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,900
But one of the things you
will see overall is the

1023
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:46,766
difference between how
democracy is handled in

1024
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:49,133
some of these issues and
how authoritarian regimes

1025
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,500
do with the support of
state-owned enterprises to

1026
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:53,466
meet those objectives.

1027
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:57,366
That's sort of the - I
mean, if you step back,

1028
00:44:57,433 --> 00:45:00,766
that's sort of one of the
big icebergs that I think

1029
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,366
we touched on
in various ways.

1030
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,733
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: We
have time for two more

1031
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,000
questions over here.

1032
00:45:05,066 --> 00:45:07,732
Go ahead, ma'am,
and then Ted.

1033
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,833
>> KAREN JUDD SMITH:
Karen Judd Smith.

1034
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,533
I have worked largely with
international NGOs, crime

1035
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,433
prevention, and criminal
justice in the United

1036
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,699
Nations, and part of my
question connects with

1037
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:19,266
the previous two.

1038
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,266
With transparency and
communication of what you

1039
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,566
are doing, is that going
to be presented at the

1040
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:28,165
Crime Congress in
April in Kyoto?

1041
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:34,699
The other part of that
would be do you hope that

1042
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:40,400
your findings are then
more able to be adopted by

1043
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:41,500
other countries.

1044
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:42,698
Are you looking that far?

1045
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:44,566
Was that part of
your consideration?

1046
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:48,299
Or were you purely
looking at the U.S.A.

1047
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:50,966
and its status situation?

1048
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:52,466
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Why don't I take the front part of that?

1049
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:55,066
We were at about 40
different conferences and such.

1050
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:56,332
Not Kyoto right now.

1051
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,966
It doesn't mean we won't
necessarily be there.

1052
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:02,633
But I will say our remit
was not to provide

1053
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:05,599
guidance to
non-U.S. policymakers.

1054
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,699
It was to provide guidance.

1055
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,000
But part of that would be
to provide guidance in a

1056
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:13,265
way that's inclusive
with our international

1057
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,133
partners and allies.

1058
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,300
I think some of our
recommendations are easily

1059
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:19,866
adaptable by allies and
partners, but our intent

1060
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,800
was not to provide a broad
strategic approach that

1061
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,099
would fix everything.

1062
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,566
>> CHRIS INGLIS: We
recognized that we have to

1063
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:28,765
have a strategy that
cannot simply coexist but

1064
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,199
to integrate and
collaborate with the

1065
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:31,966
strategies of other
nations, particularly

1066
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:33,766
like-minded nations.

1067
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,400
If it fails at the boundary, then it fails, absolutely.

1068
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:39,066
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING: And
there is some discussion

1069
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:42,566
about the organizations
within our government that

1070
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,299
can be involved in
capacity building around

1071
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:50,400
the world, including our
certs and the FBI attaches

1072
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:52,933
overseas, et cetera.

1073
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,733
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: Final
question for you, Ted.

1074
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,833
>> TED: Frank, I don't
want to read too much into

1075
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,433
something you said, but I would love more clarification.

1076
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,566
You went out of your way
to talk about - my words -

1077
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,299
the haves and the
have-nots in the private

1078
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:11,966
sector that will be
considered critical,

1079
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:14,699
somewhat critical,
not critical at all.

1080
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:17,599
I'm curious as to the
debate that you all went

1081
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:21,500
through to try and figure
out how do we explain to

1082
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:24,066
some subset of the U.S.

1083
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:28,232
economy and American
people that - again, my

1084
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,300
words - they don't count.

1085
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:32,900
We're not going to
defend on their behalf.

1086
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:40,699
We're not going to take
action on their behalf.

1087
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:43,666
What is ultimately the
responsibility from a

1088
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:50,000
cyber resilience, a cyber
defend forward strategy if

1089
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,500
not for all the citizens
of the United States and

1090
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:55,799
all of the companies in
the United States, but a subset?

1091
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:58,133
I'm just kind of
curious on that debate.

1092
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,400
I have to thank all of
you for all the time and

1093
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:02,466
energy you put into this.

1094
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:03,766
>> CHRIS INGLIS: Do
you want to go first?

1095
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,233
>> FRANK CILLUFFO:
Firstly, I didn't mean to

1096
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,166
suggest that if you're not
in the lifeline sector,

1097
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,000
you're not critical.

1098
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:14,433
It is just some are more
critical from a national and

1099
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,833
- a national security and economic security perspective.

1100
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,766
Nothing in our report
would suggest or insinuate

1101
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,466
that the other
sectors are not.

1102
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,066
We did spend a
whole lot of time.

1103
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,433
Here is the
reality, though.

1104
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,933
Not everyone could absorb
certain capabilities that

1105
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,866
if we really want to move
the needle in terms of

1106
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:38,800
enhanced cooperation,
combined operations with

1107
00:48:38,866 --> 00:48:41,366
different entities, not
everyone could absorb some

1108
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:42,433
of that capability.

1109
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,800
I think that there is a
level of capacity to be

1110
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:51,766
able to plug in and is
coherent a way as can be.

1111
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,433
Please don't get from any
of my comments, I always

1112
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,699
step on it, I've never
had an unspoken thought.

1113
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,433
It is not to suggest that
they are not critical.

1114
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,400
It's just that some are
more so than others.

1115
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,500
That's the stark reality.

1116
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,098
>> CHRIS INGLIS: I would
add two things to that.

1117
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:08,866
One, and I think you would
understand this as well as

1118
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:12,133
anyone on the commission,
it is really hard to say

1119
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,633
there is a discrete entity
out there that's perhaps

1120
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,666
number one on the list and
another discrete entity

1121
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:18,400
that's number
last on the list.

1122
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:19,400
It is more complicated
than that.

1123
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,098
You have to actually pull
the thread across and say

1124
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,066
what is the critical
function which is going to

1125
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:25,633
quickly run across
not simply the 16

1126
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:26,699
critical infrastructures.

1127
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:29,033
So if you're thinking
about, you know, our

1128
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,333
ability to do payment
reconciliation at the end

1129
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,566
of the day, either for
Wall Street or New York

1130
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:37,299
City, you have got to
actually have the data

1131
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:39,400
systems, you have got to
have the electricity, you

1132
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:40,833
have got to have the
water systems, and so

1133
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,933
on and so forth.

1134
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
When you pull that thread,
you say is that a critical

1135
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:46,299
function for the United
States or for kind of

1136
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:47,466
the global economy?

1137
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,433
Yes.

1138
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,000
What are all the things
attached to that?

1139
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:51,732
You're going to find that
that picks up quite a lot

1140
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,000
of the leaves of the tree.

1141
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:56,000
That's not simply a single
branch or a single kind of

1142
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:57,966
nut on the tree.

1143
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:00,199
Two, there is in the
report this sense of, we

1144
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:01,699
don't use this term
because it can be

1145
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:04,033
overused, but a rising
tide raises all boats.

1146
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,533
If you increase, right,
the inherent resilience

1147
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,699
and robustness of the
digital infrastructure, if

1148
00:50:08,766 --> 00:50:10,433
you invest in the
education of the people

1149
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,866
who are the frontline of
defense such that they may

1150
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:14,766
in some meaningful way
participate in their own

1151
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,233
defense, you have taken
care of everyone in the

1152
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,599
mix and perhaps brought
everybody up a bit beyond

1153
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:22,400
where they might be.

1154
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,900
I have heard the
intelligence community

1155
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:26,966
say, I must therefore
believe it, that if you

1156
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,566
did three things, you'd
take 85% of the mischief

1157
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:30,533
off the table.

1158
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,633
If you had meaningful
segmentation, if you

1159
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,699
exercised lease privilege,
if you did two-factor

1160
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:37,300
authentication, and
patched on time, maybe

1161
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:40,333
it's four things, but if
you did those things, 85%

1162
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,266
of it goes away.

1163
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,433
I think that there are
these broad strategies

1164
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,566
where the rising tide
raises all boats where you

1165
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:47,832
say we're going to do that
concurrent with we're

1166
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,433
going to then figure out
what are the most critical

1167
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,766
functions, pull that
thread, and work along

1168
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,900
those lines trying to
actually deliver something

1169
00:50:53,966 --> 00:50:57,665
to everyone, but in
a priority order.

1170
00:50:57,733 --> 00:50:59,400
>> MARK MONTGOMERY: If you
want to see all of these

1171
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:02,033
recommendations in their
entirety, then, as Chris

1172
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,699
said, on 11 March, we will
have our rollout event and

1173
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:06,966
the report will be posted
electronically on our

1174
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:09,232
website, which I think
went live today, at

1175
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,433
www.solarium.gov.

1176
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,433
And there will be a series
of think tank events and

1177
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,933
hearings around that, but
March 11th is a big day.

1178
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,666
It will be on C-SPAN or
C-SPAN Ocho, one of them,

1179
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,266
and you will have
a chance to see it.

1180
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,599
I would like to take the
opportunity here to thank

1181
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,900
our three commissioners
here for their comments.

1182
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,066
>> SUZANNE SPAULDING:
And thank you, Mark.

1183
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,933
>> FRANK CILLUFFO:
Thank you, Mark.
