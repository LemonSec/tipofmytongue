1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,333
(fast paced piano riff)

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,719
- Is there an immunity that gets built up

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,300
in an audience, say if you
did something very similar

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,000
to that, a trick that was
similar that had slight of hand,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,330
could you do trick after
trick, after trick,

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,709
after trick, after trick, like that

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,510
and would the audience still be amazed?

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,240
- I don't think you can do
trick after trick, after trick,

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,239
anymore than you could with
the exception being The Ramons,

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,180
play every song at the
same tempo in the same key.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,013
- Okay.

12
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:38,400
- Ramons are a very special situation.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,430
- Exception, outlier.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,600
- But other than that,
because magic is not

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,850
exactly what you think it is.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,780
Knowing the secret does
not completely blow it up,

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,490
anymore than if you're
a big fan of a musician

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,370
and you see the entire chart,
every note that's played,

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,739
they lay out what was on
each of the 32 tracks.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,556
I guess that how old fashioned I am.

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:06,970
What's on each of the
tracks, it doesn't destroy

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,640
the work of art.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,400
We do a show called "Fool Us," and we see,

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,150
as we will see next week,
we'll see about 100 magicians.

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,490
One after the other, and we know,

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,570
and that is the principle of
the game show we're doing,

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,119
we know how the tricks are
done and yet we still get

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,510
that feeling of wonder.

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,230
We do a thing on our
show now where we explain

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,660
how to do a french drop,
right in the same show

31
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,880
where we do a trick using
that and it's remarkable

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,619
because what you are targeting
is the intellectual level

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,860
but also a visceral level
as well and those two,

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,900
what gives you the entertainment
is those two fighting

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,170
because even without us
explaining the secret to you,

36
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,110
you do know it's a secret.

37
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,570
You do know it's a trick.

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,779
You do know we're not actually

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,440
bending the rules of reality.

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,670
So it's that fight between the
visceral and the intellectual

41
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,800
that I would argue make all
entertainment interesting

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,460
but especially magic.

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,299
- Even when we tell the truth,
we often very visibly lie.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,910
There are no seven principles of magic.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,240
We made those up.

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,430
They happen to coincide
with some of the real ones,

47
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,550
but we thought seven
was a kinda good number.

48
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,480
- What I find so confusing
about people's panic

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,480
over deep fakes is we
had this very short time

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,900
in human history, maybe
kinda sort of 150 years,

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,050
maybe even 100, where there
was some sort of evidence

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,900
that you could get
electronically or chemically.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,360
You could get photographs,
you could get audio recording,

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,860
you could get video, that
were in some way believable.

55
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,480
But that's a small chunk.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,220
I mean at the time of the
founding of the United States,

57
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,010
anybody could print anything.

58
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,989
And it was automatically a deep fake.

59
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,140
You could say, Thomas Jefferson
said the means of production

60
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,429
should be held by the
workers, you could put that

61
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,090
in quotation marks and say he said this

62
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,060
in front of 1,000 people and
the audience was very able

63
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,210
to say, do we believe the person
who put that in quotations?

64
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,540
Do we believe the people
that printed this?

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,510
And we functioned very well with that.

66
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,250
We function very well with
paintings that people would say,

67
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,350
is that painting an actual
representation of the King?

68
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,079
No, they probably dolled it
up a little bit, you know?

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,430
They were able to do that and I think,

70
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,970
I actually welcome the
deep fakes and so on

71
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,920
because that allows people
to give away, give up

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,019
on this idea that electronic
or chemical reproductions

73
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,020
of reality are never a
match for trust and honesty

74
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,510
and I'm afraid that even with words

75
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,280
like fake news being thrown around

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,440
and with people, as they say
in every shock editorial,

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,218
choosing their own realities,
I have a great deal

78
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:14,218
of comfort in my belief that
the solution to bad speech

79
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,899
is more speech and that
this is a weird time.

80
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,900
You know, for a million
years our biggest problem

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,670
was too little information.

82
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,450
Now we've got two decades
where we're starting

83
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,534
to have the problem being
too much information.

84
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:34,370
A person 400 years ago
in their entire life

85
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,900
would have gotten the amount
of information in one issue

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,719
of The New York Times.

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,410
Now, we get all that
information all the time

88
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,500
and learning to deal with
that in a way that is wise

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,930
is gonna take us a little while

90
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,460
and that shouldn't be a surprise.

91
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,152
- One of the great benefits
to seeing a magic performance

92
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:55,130
is that when you walk in,
the person who's performing

93
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,469
has said, I am about to lie to you.

94
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,080
Which is more than you
get out of most liars.

95
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,050
- That is true.
(laughter)

96
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,883
Highly unusual.

97
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,370
- And so, you sit there
and you watch what you know

98
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,650
to be a lie and look for the lie

99
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,650
and I think one of the things

100
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,739
that makes magic sort
of perennial is that,

101
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,110
that has always been something that

102
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,500
we've really worried about.

103
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
People lying is a very big deal

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,060
and when somebody lies and
we're just celebrating it,

105
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,370
right, we're just enjoying
the fact that the guy is lying

106
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,410
to you or the woman is lying
to you, it has a sort of

107
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,960
refreshing kind of therapeutic quality.

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,539
- Nothing we did this
afternoon was technology

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,130
that didn't exist hundreds of years ago.

110
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,963
- Yes.

111
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,860
- We used nothing technological
and it's interesting

112
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,813
that where we live,

113
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,860
in our shows, we are much
more successful fooling people

114
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,240
with technology that's
existed for hundreds of years

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,860
than the newest stuff because
people are so thinking

116
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,060
about the newest stuff
and the old stuff is,

117
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,440
as Teller said, in
different sense, perennial.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,264
- Everything that we used
in the password trick,

119
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:04,722
was developed in the
mid to late 19th century

120
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,729
to fool people who were
coming to spirit mediums.

121
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,020
They would write down messages
for their dead relative

122
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,560
and then the medium would
somehow divine what that is

123
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,210
from the vast beyond, but
it's all just, you know,

124
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,489
it's many of the same
principles we mentioned

125
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,890
in our lying seven principles.

126
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,890
- Instead of using the magic
cause being an afterlife,

127
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,236
our magic cause is the
paranoia of surveillance

128
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:30,130
that we all experience now.

129
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,781
You know, you always have to
have a cause for the magic.

130
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,031
(relaxing piano music)
