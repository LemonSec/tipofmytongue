00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,166
>> MARY BARRA: Well, thank
you everyone for being

2
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:31,166
here and for those watching
via live stream as well.

3
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,799
I'd like to start my
session by kicking off -

4
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,966
kicking it off
with a video.

5
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:37,000
So, if we could roll
the video, please.

6
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,899
(Music playing)

7
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,133
>> VOICE OVER IN VIDEO:
The most amazing things

8
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,866
happening in the
environmental space, the

9
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,032
energy space, the
healthcare space, the

10
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,833
entertainment space, the
technology space are all

11
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,133
happening in the space
between the wheels of

12
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,466
every vehicle GM is
making right now.

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,099
>> MALE SPEAKER IN VIDEO:
We're all set for auto control.

14
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,366
I've been -

15
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,400
(Applause)

16
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,133
Thank you.

17
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,866
It's pretty exciting.

18
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,198
I've been in the auto
industry my entire life

19
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,233
and I'm proudly from
Michigan where the

20
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,833
automotive industry is
woven into our identity.

21
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
I wanted to share that
video before we got

22
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,333
started because it's
important to set some context.

23
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,599
The auto industry as we
know it has been around

24
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,698
for over a hundred years.

25
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,266
When automobiles were
first adopted on mass

26
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,133
scale, they weren't just
features of convenience.

27
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,733
They fundamentally reshaped
our physical environment.

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
They changed the way we
live our lives for so many

29
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,466
people and they
brought freedom.

30
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,565
But they also brought
unintended consequences,

31
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:35,000
crashes that can result
in both death and injury,

32
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,599
pollution that is
contributing to climate

33
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,466
change, and congestion
that swallows up all too

34
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,933
many hours of our lives.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,500
These are very real
problems at very large

36
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:49,800
scale but we have the
technology and the

37
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:53,599
expertise to solve them
and we do believe that the

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,599
future looks good.

39
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,500
We see the future of
transformation that is one

40
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,933
that is all electric,
self-driving, and

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,666
fundamentally,
it is connected.

42
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,966
And that's why
I'm here today.

43
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:09,033
Several members of our
global cybersecurity team

44
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,000
join me today, including
Kevin Tierney who leads

45
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:15,000
our global
cybersecurity efforts.

46
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:18,466
Kevin and his team are
huge advocates of RSA's

47
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:22,366
work to address cyber
threats around the world.

48
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,966
I know this room needs no
convincing that there are

49
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,866
virtually no industries
today that are not

50
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,266
vulnerable to
cyber-attacks.

51
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,800
And the auto industry
is no exception.

52
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,666
We are bringing to market
technologies and features

53
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,899
that are radically
changing what vehicles can

54
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:43,133
do for people and to
improve their lives.

55
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,166
At the same time,
customers are bringing

56
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,699
more devices into the
vehicle and expecting

57
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,933
seamless integration.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,399
Part of our job is to
ensure that our customers

59
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:57,199
and their data are always
safe, secure, and private.

60
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,699
Privacy is an extension
of security that

61
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,000
we fiercely protect.

62
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,933
At General Motors, early
on we recognized the

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,566
emerging risks and we
proactively built a

64
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:10,799
dedicated global
cybersecurity organization

65
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:14,866
that is deep, broad, and
well-funded, with hands on

66
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,366
engagement from our
Board of Directors.

67
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,800
It's that important to us.

68
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,765
We view cybersecurity not
as an area we invest in

69
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,266
for a competitive
advantage; we see it as a

70
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,199
systemic concern
for our industry.

71
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,399
I think you know the auto
industry is fiercely

72
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,366
competitive, but
cybersecurity is an area

73
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:38,199
in which we must and where
we do act as a united

74
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:41,966
front to collaborate and
share best practices.

75
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,033
Kevin chairs the US Auto
Information Sharing and

76
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,699
Analysis Center, known as
Auto ISAC, which provides

77
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,733
a safe, trusted
environment for

78
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,866
participating members to
create and share leading

79
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,366
best practices for
the entire industry.

80
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,966
Collectively, we
incorporate strong

81
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,266
security measures into
every phase of the vehicle

82
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,333
development process.

83
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,766
As this group knows all
too well, the threat

84
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,733
landscape is continually
evolving, with

85
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
sophisticated attacks
specifically designed to

86
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:17,866
circumvent even the most
robust defense systems.

87
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,233
Our enterprise defense
strategy has to be

88
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,500
integrated and
multi-layered because when

89
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,933
a cybercriminal only needs
to be effective once, we

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,966
must get it right
100% of the time.

91
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,333
Appropriately, the theme
of this year's RSA

92
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,600
Conference is the
human element.

93
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,133
All of you here today are
the best and strongest line

94
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,833
of defense in this ongoing,
even more complex fight.

95
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,766
So, thank you for
choosing this profession.

96
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,666
We need millions more of
you and I'll touch on that

97
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,899
in a few minutes.

98
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,300
As I mentioned at the
start, we believe we have

99
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,166
big solutions needed for
the big problems we face.

100
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,466
At General Motors, our
vision is to create a

101
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,466
world with zero
crashes, zero emissions,

102
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,600
and zero congestion.

103
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,033
It's not a pipe dream.

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,199
We know it's achievable.

105
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,333
The critical technologies
that will make it a

106
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,899
reality include
electrification,

107
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,033
autonomous vehicles,
and connectivity.

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,733
And cybersecurity is
foundational to all of these.

109
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,699
Let me share
just one example.

110
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,000
If you live here in San
Francisco, you have likely

111
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:28,765
seen some of the test
vehicles from Cruise, and

112
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,466
they are driving all
around the city.

113
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:34,366
Cruise is GM's autonomous
arm that is developing and

114
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,300
testing all electric,
self-driving vehicles here

115
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,265
in San Francisco
because of its

116
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,266
challenging driving conditions.

117
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,566
Human error is still
responsible for nine out

118
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,066
of ten vehicle crashes.

119
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,299
When we get it right, and
we will, what's at stake

120
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,599
is the opportunity to
virtually eliminate

121
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,033
crashes and the
significant human and

122
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,000
economic cost they bring.

123
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,566
It's pretty important.

124
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,133
In our approach to
autonomous vehicles, we

125
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,100
decided early on that
safety had to be a gating

126
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,933
metric and that's a part
of everything we do at

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,666
General Motors.

128
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,600
For our customers, it
means providing the safest

129
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,100
products and the strongest
cybersecurity possible

130
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,399
while also giving them
greater convenience,

131
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,399
better accessibility,
and all while doing it

132
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,800
at affordable costs.

133
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,133
We are pushing the
boundaries of engineering

134
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,300
and redefining what
vehicles can do.

135
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:32,000
Last month, Cruise
introduced Origin, a

136
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,933
purpose built electric
autonomous vehicle we

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,866
jointly developed with
Honda and Cruise designed

138
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,100
with more interior space
to provide better, more

139
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,299
consistent shared
experience than a

140
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:45,266
conventional vehicle.

141
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,399
The origin has no pedals,
no steering wheel, or

142
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,500
backup human driver.

143
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,299
Using highly specialized
sensors and computers, it

144
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,966
delivers superhuman
performance at a

145
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,033
reasonable cost.

146
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,399
It features multiple
layers of protection,

147
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:03,466
designed from the ground
up like the vehicle itself

148
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,866
by Cruise's own
cybersecurity team,

149
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:11,165
working in collaboration
with GM's global team.

150
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:14,266
We all know that all
electric AVs will save

151
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,132
millions of lives
around the world and

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,833
protect our planet.

153
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,700
They are real and they are
going to help us rewrite

154
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,766
the rules of
personal mobility.

155
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,533
But when it comes to
promoting them to the

156
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,399
driving public and to
policy makers, the trust

157
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:34,600
factor is equally
important to the technology.

158
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,100
Before consumers invest
their trust in us, they

159
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,166
want to be assured that
AVs will operate safely

160
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:44,266
and securely every time
without being hacked by

161
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,266
outside forces.

162
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,799
A critical cyber breach
involving any one company

163
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,866
will be an incident
that affects everyone

164
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,000
in this space.

165
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,166
It could severely
undermine the consumer

166
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,965
confidence in this type of
mobility and even delay

167
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,766
the industry's ability to
share these benefits with

168
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,065
customers and society.

169
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,766
It's why we are so
focused on industry-wide

170
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:11,665
cybersecurity collaboration
and shared solutions.

171
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,233
Now at General Motors, we
spend about $100 million

172
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:19,000
or over $100 million per
year on cybersecurity.

173
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,333
We look at the risks end
to end, from the back

174
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,266
office to all aspects
of the vehicle.

175
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,933
There are no shortcuts
and there is no one size

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,899
fits all solutions.

177
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,166
We have nearly five
hundred men and women,

178
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,899
including penetration
engineers, cryptologists,

179
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,933
mathematicians, data
analysts, program managers

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,933
and true hackers.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,899
We're developing in-depth
defense monitoring and

182
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,000
detection and incident
response capabilities that

183
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:50,399
we continually test,
rework, and refine.

184
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,500
We've implemented this
program in part with

185
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,966
partners like HackerOne
and its white hat hackers

186
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,833
to engage more closely
with the research

187
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,766
community and identify
vulnerabilities before

188
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,000
they become an issue.

189
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:06,833
It has matured into a
formal bug bounty program

190
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,466
that continues to further
validate and strengthen

191
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,933
our cybersecurity efforts.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,933
We know we can never be
complacent and must always

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,533
be benchmarking our
cybersecurity practices

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,466
against best practices and
always, always, always

195
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,266
looking for
ways to improve.

196
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,833
Critically, we've also
reengineered our vehicle

197
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,533
development process to
include cybersecurity from

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,100
the earliest stages of
vehicle design, with

199
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,633
multiple layers of
protection to defend the

200
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,966
vehicle and its systems.

201
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,866
This year, we are
introducing the first

202
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:43,500
vehicle models with our
new - all new vehicle

203
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,833
intelligent platform
or VIP as we call it.

204
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,600
It supports new EV
technologies, it supports

205
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,799
active safety systems,
over the air updates, 5G

206
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:56,500
networks, and enhanced
cybersecurity protections.

207
00:11:56,566 --> 00:12:00,066
We think of it as the nervous system for our vehicles.

208
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,366
As I said, with all the
coding support from

209
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,466
different computations
that run hundreds of the

210
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,366
features in your car, from
something as simple as

211
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,466
windshield wipers that
automatically turn on when

212
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,299
it rains, to our Super
Cruise system which is the

213
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,533
world's first true
hands-free driving system,

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,133
VIP becomes essential,
empowering, and enabling

215
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,066
these features.

216
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:25,033
Our VIP has the capability
to deliver 4.5 terabytes

217
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,600
of processing
power per hour.

218
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,333
While our vehicles include
cybersecurity provisions

219
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,033
built before the VIP
architecture came into

220
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,399
being, these are the first
built with cybersecurity

221
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,133
as a cornerstone.

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,433
I want to point out that
our cyber efforts extend

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,833
well beyond the
cybersecurity organization.

224
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,433
We have an environment of
cyber hygiene across the

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,533
entire enterprise,
including those who will

226
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,700
never write a line of code
because our defenses are

227
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:57,433
only as strong as
the weakest link.

228
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
At GM, thousands of
software developers are

229
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,100
fully trained in secure
coding practices and

230
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,433
they're on the front line
as they write the software

231
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,399
to incorporate
technologies such as

232
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,933
Amazon Alexa and Google
applications and services

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,799
into our vehicles.

234
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,665
We see them as a huge,
vital extension of our

235
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,266
cybersecurity team.

236
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,833
We also work closely with
our partner suppliers,

237
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,433
tens of thousands of them,
to ensure the integrity,

238
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,033
security, and quality of
our products and we share

239
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,866
the knowledge through the
Cyber Readiness Institute.

240
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,633
We collaborate with the
medical device, aerospace,

241
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,966
defense, and consumer
electronics industries.

242
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:41,000
And we've adopted the
Commerce Department's

243
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,466
National Institute of
Standards and Technology,

244
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,866
NIST, Cyber Framework
which was developed with a

245
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,266
focus on industries
vital to national

246
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,632
and economic security.

247
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,033
In the past year, we
entered into a cooperative

248
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,466
research and development
agreement with the US Army

249
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,466
Ground Vehicle Systems
Center to strengthen our

250
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,433
joint automotive
cybersecurity expertise

251
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,700
over the next two years.

252
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:06,699
And this is a first
for our industry.

253
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,933
We'll be sharing key
learnings with the Society

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,299
of Automotive Engineers
for the development of

255
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,665
common standards for
widespread benefit.

256
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,632
So, as you can see,
there's a lot going on, a

257
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,899
lot of collaboration, and
going forward, we know

258
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,833
we'll need even more.

259
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,666
We know this is a marathon
with no finish line.

260
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,833
So, let's get
back to talent.

261
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,899
We need more
talent, a lot more.

262
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:35,100
I'm sure you've seen the
same statistics that I have.

263
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,166
The estimates of unfilled
cybersecurity jobs range

264
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:43,032
from 1.8 million to
nearly 4 million by 2022.

265
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,600
Without the right people
and the right tools, the

266
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,033
security risks will be
increasingly in this

267
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,166
connected world and
endanger all of us.

268
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,433
For the long-term success
of virtually every

269
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,233
business that exists
within a digital

270
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:02,033
ecosystem, we must fill
the talent gap and not

271
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,666
just with anyone
but with everyone.

272
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,333
Women and minorities
continue to be severely

273
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,733
underrepresented in the IT
and engineering fields, so

274
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,132
we've started our outreach
even earlier, as young as

275
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,500
middle school, to
encourage them to pursue

276
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:18,799
rewarding careers.

277
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:20,133
We're doing this
by working with

278
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,233
organizations, encouraging
students to pursue STEM

279
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,033
careers and provide hands
on, real world exposure to

280
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,299
ignite their interest and
help them see a path for

281
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,100
themselves in this space.

282
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,399
Last year alone, our work
touched nearly 300,000

283
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:40,000
students and teachers
across the United States.

284
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,166
Two years ago, working
with the Society of

285
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,500
Automotive Engineers,
we introduced a new

286
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:47,000
interactive student
cybersecurity challenge

287
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:50,166
and curriculum for middle
school students across the

288
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,399
company - excuse me -
across the country.

289
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,500
Guided by teachers and
volunteers from the

290
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:58,899
cybersecurity team, the
students learned how

291
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,633
digital information is
transferred and protected

292
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,166
in their everyday lives,
as well as how these

293
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:09,032
concepts tie to STEM careers, especially in mobility.

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,299
Beyond this program,
our army of employees

295
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:14,066
generously volunteer their
time to support various

296
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:17,500
STEM programs in local
schools, presenting,

297
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:21,899
teaching, mentoring, and
overall, just getting involved.

298
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,166
If we want to cultivate
young people to be part of

299
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,733
our future, we need
to invest in theirs.

300
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,033
So, I want to thank RSA
for bringing us all here

301
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,200
today and for your
commitment to being part

302
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,632
of the solution.

303
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
This conference is an
example of what we need

304
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:39,066
more of, creating more
awareness of the issue and

305
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:42,500
emphasizing the need to
work together to achieve

306
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,366
what none of us
can do on our own.

307
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,500
It is a crucial time for
the auto industry but it's

308
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,399
also an incredibly
exciting time.

309
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,566
We are undergoing
transformation that has

310
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:55,799
not occurred over the
last hundred years.

311
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,966
We need to leverage our
collective strength and

312
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,566
the institutional
knowledge to move forward

313
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:04,299
into a new age that is
safer, better, and more

314
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:08,366
sustainable for a
future that looks good.

315
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,200
So, thank you very much.
