1
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:03,430
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,530
- Yesterday we actually
had a really amazing dinner

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,340
with a ton of experts and it
was an amazing experience.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,040
Several of the people on the
panel in the keynotes yesterday

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,319
were there and so we got
to have dinner with them

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,670
and so I got to talk to
some really big names.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,471
Diffie was there.

8
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,304
- [Interviewer] So cool.

9
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:24,226
- Along with both R and S so,

10
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:25,220
- [Interviewer] Wow.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,400
- Pretty big deal.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,229
I'm not as involved in
the cyber community.

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,230
I work in Radio Frequency
Machine Learning actually,

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,099
so mostly I've been
attending the different talks

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,910
about machine learning,
adversarial machine learning,

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,819
'cause it's kind of what I'm interested in

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,350
and a lot of this stuff goes over my head

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,630
but it still seems really cool

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,018
and I think it's always good
to get another perspective

20
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,900
on things.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,830
And everyone has been really great.

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,545
Everyone's willing to
talk to me

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,373
(piano music)
