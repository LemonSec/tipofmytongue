>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome George Takei.

00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,366
(Applause)

00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:21,033
>> GEORGE TAKEI:
Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,266
I'm honored to be here with all
of you today in San Francisco.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,433
The human element.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
What makes us us?

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:37,799
For 200,000 years, roughly the
amount of time humankind has

8
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:43,366
existed, we have been walking on
two feet, exploring, living with

9
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:47,433
others, sometimes
avoiding others.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,833
Before long, our
brains grew huge.

11
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,166
86 billion neurons
huge and counting.

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,433
Aristotle told us
that we're rational animals

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,399
seeking knowledge.

14
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:07,900
Confucius added that
humans are benevolent.

15
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,298
Oh, my!

16
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,766
I hope that's true.

17
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,599
I hope we're designed
to help one another.

18
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:21,533
Psychologists say that when we
grow up in a group or a family,

19
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,333
we seek to be like one another.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,433
But we also seek
to be different.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,233
So if you're good at math, your
siblings will either join your

22
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,933
pursuit or excel
at something else.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,066
If you yearn to be something
that doesn't quite suit your

24
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:45,066
group dynamic, or if you feel
alone, you might seek out others

25
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:51,033
to form a new community where
you can be exactly who you long

26
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:52,366
to be.

27
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,966
How beautiful is that?

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Every mind in this room
works in its own unique way.

29
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:04,900
Like fingerprints, no
two brains are the same.

30
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:11,132
Each thought is informed by your
genetic disposition, and your

31
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:20,466
environment, life experiences,
race, gender, age, beliefs,

32
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,732
brain chemistry.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,133
This exquisite diversity enables
us to handle problems that might

34
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,000
perplex us if we
faced them alone.

35
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:38,366
This reminds me of a beloved
acronym, first uttered over 50

36
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:43,933
years ago, on Star Trek,
The Original Series.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,033
IDIC.

38
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:52,000
IDIC stands for
infinite diversity and

39
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,266
infinite combinations.

40
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,866
You innately think differently.

41
00:02:56,933 --> 00:03:00,666
The very human and
unprogrammable future empowers

42
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:03,466
you to help defend our world.

43
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,933
Some of you are hunters.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,866
You seek out facts.

45
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,766
Others are gatherers,
collecting and sharing

46
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,633
intelligence with others.

47
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,500
A number of you are
builders, making companies and

48
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,233
inventing solutions.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,500
There are also fixers among
you who repair systems and

50
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,933
restore data.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,733
And there are those who think
differently, outliers and

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,266
dreamers among you.

53
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:38,133
Together, you protect our world
against destructive attacks.

54
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,733
You defend us from
any threat imaginable.

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,966
In your industry,
homogeneity equals disaster.

56
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:52,366
But unity of purpose among
very different people, that's

57
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,698
another story.

58
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:58,833
No matter what differentiates
you, you are united by a common

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,233
purpose: Preventing, detecting,
and responding to threats.

60
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:09,033
I ask each of you to
think about your personal

61
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,866
human element.

62
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:14,500
Are you an
idealist or an altruist?

63
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:18,166
A mentor or a student?

64
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:21,600
A rebel or a collaborator?

65
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:28,332
We must honor our diverse traits
for our species to stay alive.

66
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,199
If we are benevolent about our
differences, we can boldly go

67
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,300
where no one has gone before.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,766
As you leave the keynote today,
I invite you to explore our

69
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,733
human element installation
outside in the lobby and

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,666
upstairs in the
engagement store.

71
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:55,199
There, you may choose a human
element button that identifies

72
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,666
you to the RSA
conference community.

73
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:03,333
Wear it proudly, as I am.

74
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,500
Open your mind to the people
you meet in the coming days.

75
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:10,066
Embrace your similarities.

76
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,899
Celebrate your differences.

77
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:17,666
And revel in the possibility
that everyone you encounter, so

78
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:23,300
different yet so alive, might
possess the very element you

79
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,233
need to change our world.

80
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:31,399
Thank you for being
extraordinary humans.

81
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,933
Live long and prosper.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,666
(Applause)
