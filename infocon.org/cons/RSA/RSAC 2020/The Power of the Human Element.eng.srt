00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,417
(soft music)

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,280
- You know, if you look
at an RSA conference 2020,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,730
we've really tried to focus in

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,580
around this idea of the human element.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,230
And you've seen it everywhere,

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,970
you see the posters,
you've seen it as a theme,

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,330
and a lot of the talks,

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,630
- With the human element,

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,710
- The human element.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,820
- Investing in the human element,

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,200
- The human element.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,070
- And it's one of the greatest

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,760
unsolved mysteries I would say

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,360
of the security space and
a bunch of different ways.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,230
One is, we need humanity,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,480
we need diversity of thought
and views and perspectives

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,300
to be able to deal with
this security problem.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,820
That's one, and we've
had a lot of sessions

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,150
and workshops focused on that.

20
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,670
We also, need to understand

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,710
that our users are very diverse,

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,710
and have certain ways of thinking.

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,850
And, we need to know how
they're gonna assess risk,

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,223
and look at a problem.

25
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,700
But we also need to understand

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,630
what our limitations are as people.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,050
- We need to collaborate,

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,480
not just within security teams,

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,300
but with business risk IT and users.

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,910
Let's change our culture
to a culture of perfection,

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,580
to a culture of pragmatism.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't let perfect be
the enemy of the good.

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,500
- What I want us to think
about is what do we not do

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,030
that involves our phones?

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,300
The addiction to mobile

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,070
is what makes them so vulnerable.

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,902
Think about this,

38
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:38,030
if you get into my phone,

39
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,240
you are getting so much more information,

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,119
than probably if you got into my Mac,

41
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,000
because I live on my mobile device.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,270
- We look at the fact that
when a user makes a mistake,

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,839
it's the user, that's the issue.

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,480
The problem is not that
users make mistakes,

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,227
but that we put users

46
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:58,580
in a position where
they can initiate loss.

47
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,980
They don't cause the loss,

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,030
they initiate a chain of events,

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,630
and that's a really
critical issue to deal with.

50
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,380
- It would be super convenient.

51
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,169
If you could just buy
a piece of technology

52
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,519
that would do everything for you.

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,850
Unfortunately, security scanners,

54
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,750
and firewalls can't solve everything.

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,130
Their effectiveness is directly related

56
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,480
to the skills and the manual effort

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,470
of the people who must tune
them to a specific environment,

58
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,370
monitor them regularly,

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,760
and filter the signal from the noise.

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,700
- What needs to happen
is for every technologist

61
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,140
inventing something really cool,

62
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,179
like differential privacy,

63
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,080
or quantum computing or whatever it is.

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,180
We probably need something like 10 people

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,650
whose role it is to
explain it to the public,

66
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,210
and to policy makers.

67
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,780
And more importantly figure out,

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,110
how our public institutions need to change

69
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,350
to best adapts to these technologies

70
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,440
and minimize the harmful effects.

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,359
You know, not lobbyists,

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,340
we need neutral people to be doing that,

73
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,220
that's something that I
think we're lacking today,

74
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,150
and something which I
hope we can figure out

75
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,110
in the next 20 years or so.

76
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,630
- Humans will remain at
the center of our story.

77
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,070
In this world the defenders

78
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,820
will be better organized
than the attackers,

79
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,989
and the spirit of the
defender will be strong.

80
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,739
- So I guess it all comes
down to the human element.

81
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,739
(audience clapping)

82
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:25,239
