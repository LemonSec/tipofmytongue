1
00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:04,280
(cheerful piano music)

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,660
- If you find a USB cable in an airport,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,170
it could be the cable
itself that hacks you.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,219
And think about this, the
persistence is in the wire.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,400
You eradicate the
malware from your system.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,810
The next time you go to charge your phone

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,080
or sync your phone, it reinfects it.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,700
And this opens up a much
bigger can of worms here,

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,009
because this could scale up to
entire supply chain attacks.

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,800
You need to think about your supply chain.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Now given all that's happening
in the world these days,

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,980
organizations are very rapidly changing

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,510
their supply change tactics, right,

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,100
it's happening right now,
many of your organizations

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,350
are doing that in light
of the medical conditions

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,740
and such that are happening.

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,020
You need to do that from
a security perspective

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,270
and with a security mindset,

19
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,880
not just knee-jerk
changing your supply chain

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,060
to something that might
even be more vulnerable.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,440
I urge you to read this wonderful document

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,571
from the UK's National
Cyber Security Center.

23
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:58,280
- We have changed culture
in the past 18 to 24 months,

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,410
where security has become
foundational, right?

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,519
You either build it on
a secure environment,

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,940
as secure as you can at the time,

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,520
because cost, schedule,
performance do not matter

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,030
in an unsecured environment.

29
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,810
It doesn't matter if you deliver something

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,350
in the supply chain with the
delivery at approved cost,

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,669
or at the performance
that you agreed upon,

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,090
or the schedule, if you
get it and it don't work.

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,120
- Is this trade or is
this national security?

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,150
And the unfortunate answer is it's both,

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,790
and it depends on who you're talking to

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,280
as to which one they're
going to prioritize.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,530
And part of the reason that
we are in this situation

38
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,416
with China and 5G, is
that for so many companies

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,530
over the past 20 years,
their answer has been

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,590
oh, I'm going to prioritize
the economic aspect

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,100
and not the security aspect.

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,149
And so if we really are
screwed when it comes to 5G

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,570
and we wanna think about securing 6G,

44
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,610
then we need to spend an awful
lot of time about thinking

45
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,100
how did we end up in the
spot where we are now.

46
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,770
- And the thing that
I worry the most about

47
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,050
is source code manipulation.

48
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,372
We have seen some supply chain attacks,

49
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:59,130
most famously with the Juniper code

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,080
that was backdoored and a
number of security vendors

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,050
have experienced the same thing.

52
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm surprised we have
not seen more of these,

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,600
and it's quite possible
that they have occurred

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,190
and we just haven't caught them.

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,920
When you have an insider
particularly in your organization,

56
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,450
not an external threat actor
that is putting backdoors

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,130
in your code, that is authorized to do so,

58
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,680
really, really hard to catch

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,630
in modern, massive source code systems.

60
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,340
Obviously you also have added risks

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,700
from open source packages and the like

62
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,839
that gets added to this.

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
- To the extent that the US government

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,870
can help create greater competition among

65
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,180
equipment providers, the
world will be better off.

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,380
But we've gotta have
experts who can come up

67
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,780
with some ideas, such
as if, and that's an if,

68
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,500
if the US needs it's own
telecom equipment provider,

69
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,450
why in the world wouldn't
the US call Huawei's bluff

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,950
for the offer to license
our 5G technology?

71
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,350
Why wouldn't you at least
have those conversations?

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,250
And why don't you think
about ways that the experts

73
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,380
could say, you guys wanna come
in to Huawei's facilities,

74
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,660
and Ericsson and Nok, to deep dive,

75
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,010
what can be done, how
can third parties monitor

76
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,070
what's happening in the actual
creation and manufacture

77
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,519
to make sure that we know what we're doing

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,650
and there's independent transparency?

79
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,160
Make requests to the companies

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,100
and what can be done to
add the kind of level

81
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,670
of trust that's not there now.

82
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,040
But to simply stand silent and
not make demands and requests

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,929
on the equipment providers
doesn't help the situation.

84
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,050
- We should have the discussion

85
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,200
about what does supply
chain risk look like?

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,100
What does risk mitigation look like?

87
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,530
Understanding that risk does
not commute what my risk is,

88
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,390
it's not what your risk is,
it's a different paradigm,

89
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,779
that we can 100% have that conversation,

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,520
because it is absolutely needs to be.

91
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
- Supply chain security is an
insurmountably hard problem.

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,760
It is not just the country,
it is the equipment,

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,010
it is the program, it is the assembly,

94
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,000
it is the shipping, it is the update.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,050
We have fake apps in
the Google Play Store,

96
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,520
we had a Cisco box sent to
the Syrian telephone company

97
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,680
that the NSA intercepted.

98
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,060
Notpetya is being distributed
through a fake update

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,250
to a popular Ukrainian accounting package.

100
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,950
We can go on and on and on

101
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,890
and you can build a US-only iPhone,

102
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,539
it'll cost ten times as
much, nobody will buy it.

103
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Our industry is deeply and
irrevocably international,

104
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,863
in ways that make this
impossible to solve.

105
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,690
Now that's not fun, but
that's the world we're in.

106
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,567
So now what can we do, given that?

107
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,817
