1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:04,200
(upbeat piano music)

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,420
- There's a lot of stuff going on

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,830
in the attacker community.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,280
One of the things I do is I analyze

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,270
large scale intrusions.

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,149
So when a bad guy gets into an environment

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,440
and grabs hundreds of
thousands of credit cards,

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,883
I help with that incident
response, but I also

9
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,349
do some expert witness work to kinda see

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,730
what the attackers did.

11
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,900
And, some of the really
big things we're seeing

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,390
the attackers do now, are using different

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,820
command and control
channels, it's called C2.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,210
And there's so many
different ways that bad guys

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,780
can control systems once
they've compromised them, and

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,090
they'll take advantage of
all these different tools

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,820
and techniques to do that.

18
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,060
Another big thing they're
doing hand in hand with that

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,630
is called "living off the land."

20
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,760
So, rather than installing my own malware

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,650
on a target system as
an attacker, that might

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,790
get detected, that might
have a SOC analyst find that.

23
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,650
Instead, I'll "live off the
land." I'll use the features

24
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,966
and capabilities of the
operating system itself

25
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:57,380
as my attack tools. So I'm
essentially turning Windows or

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,120
Linux, or MAC Os against
itself and against other

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,530
systems on the network.
It's a lot stealthier and

28
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,410
harder to detect because
there's no separate malware

29
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,759
that's being put on there.

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,404
Let's face it, these
systems are built to be

31
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,690
operational and maintained
by systems administrators.

32
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,700
So the bad guy, will system
administer the machine

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,640
using the same tools and techniques that

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,770
legitimate system administrators do.

35
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,070
Another big thing that I'm seeing is

36
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,169
really deep persistence.

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,532
I mean persistence at the level

38
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:30,220
of the USB cable. There
are USB cables that

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,050
you can get now where
there is malware that's

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,119
in the head of the cable itself.

41
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,650
So if you plug it into your computer

42
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,147
it works just like a regular
USB cable would, but it

43
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:42,960
actually has malware that's
injected into your system.

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,360
So if you're walking down the street

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,929
and you see a USB cable sitting there,

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,740
you pick that thing up,
you think you just got

47
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,130
a free USB cable, you plug
it into your computer,

48
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,350
it infects your computer.

49
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,059
You don't know how the infection got there

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,780
so you clean it up, you
plug that cable in again

51
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,130
because you want to charge your phone, you

52
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,963
reinfect it.

53
00:01:57,963 --> 00:02:00,125
Because the attacks are proliferating and

54
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,130
they're getting much more subtle,

55
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,460
it's awareness of their
people. Both rank and file

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,006
end users, security awareness, but also

57
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,570
they're security
professionals, they need to

58
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,039
understand what the latest attacks are.

59
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,200
That's why we bring
every year our SANS panel

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,609
to our RSA Conference and say
look, here's what we're seeing

61
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,870
so that you can look for
this in your environment.

62
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,360
And making your
professionals aware of what

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,560
the latest attacks are so they can

64
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,270
see them while they're happening.

65
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,630
The theme this year, right?
It's the "Human Element."

66
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,730
What a great theme for the RSA conference.

67
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,209
Yes, machine learning. Yes,
AI is starting to help.

68
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,140
It's augmenting what
the humans can do, but

69
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,679
fundamentally the humans
have to win this battle.

70
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,160
I really look forward to
RSA conference every year.

71
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,421
It's one of my favorite
places to go. I travel a

72
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,000
lot, I go to a lot of
events, but this is the one.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,500
First of all, it's the
big one. It's the biggest

74
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,100
event that our industry
has. So seeing everyone

75
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,500
that's really nice, but
everyone will tell you that.

76
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,920
There's two specific areas
though, that I really

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,290
look forward too. One, is the big kickoff.

78
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,810
They usually have somebody
come in from the outside,

79
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,760
somebody that you recognize.

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,370
George Takei was there this
year. They give an inspirational

81
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,604
speech, followed by
several keynote speeches.

82
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm something of a
connoisseur of those speeches

83
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,760
I watch them and really
focus, and think about

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,100
how they cohere together, what do they

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,609
mean for the industry. This
year's keynote speeches

86
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,900
in that initial keynote
kickoff on Tuesday morning

87
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,767
were some of the best
I've ever seen. And it all

88
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,710
the way goes up to the
cryptographer's panel,

89
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,670
which was awesome this
year! It was so good.

90
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,149
I feel like a kid on Christmas morning.

91
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,220
The second thing, is RSA
Conference does this thing

92
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,870
where they bring scholars.
Undergraduates, as well as

93
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,490
graduate students from
colleges around the country

94
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,220
and perhaps around the
world. And they bring them

95
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,140
together and they send
them to the conference.

96
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,890
So they're young people,
typically, some are

97
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,626
a little bit older, but they
are bright-eyed, bushy tailed,

98
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:55,510
they're absolutely brilliant,
so excited and they invite

99
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,760
some of us to go to a dinner with them.

100
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,179
So it'll be me and one other
person in the professional

101
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,890
community with six or
seven of these students...

102
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,722
I love it.

103
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,570
It is so cool. Here in
the students, we ask them

104
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,730
what are you working on,
what are you thinking about?

105
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,880
Do you have a job lined up already or not?

106
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,019
What does your world look like?

107
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,140
They come from all different
areas. Some are focused

108
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,760
on really deep technology
stuff. Some are software

109
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,810
developers, some are more on
the sort of social aspects

110
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,020
of cyber security.
Again, the human element.

111
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,299
Just sitting there and
interacting with the students

112
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,100
and seeing their
excitement, it's infectious.

113
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,580
I walk away from that
dinner on cloud nine.

114
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,729
I'm so thankful for RSA
Conference and the ability

115
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,978
to come out here to learn
and also share ideas from

116
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:45,440
what I'm seeing. There's
nothing else in the industry

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,340
at this magnitude, with
this set of people that can

118
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,380
come together and share the ideas about

119
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,241
the human element. It
is a tremendous value.

120
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,324
(upbeat piano music)
