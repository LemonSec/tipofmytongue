1
00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:03,960
(upbeat piano music)

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,900
- So, at lot of folks think
about enterprise security

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,670
or enterprise IT security,
but operations security,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,150
or OT, operations technology,
they're just different,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,740
and they have different
threats, different mission,

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,700
different everything.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,850
And so, the security
controls and mechanisms

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,683
that you're gonna wanna do

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,170
are going to invariably be different

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,010
to reduce a different type of cyber risk.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,930
The other aspect that I'll layer onto that

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,580
is everything is OT.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,927
And so, usually people think,
"Oh, it's electric utilities,

14
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:26,840
"or oil and gas."

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,750
but it's data centers, it's rail,

16
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,920
it's the football stadiums that we have,

17
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,710
it's water, it's everything.

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,300
And so, everyone probably
has some level of OT

19
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,290
in their environments
or in their companies.

20
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,560
Some of them, they are
an OT company really

21
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,320
and the IT is the aftermath.

22
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,590
And we need to work
together and figure out

23
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,330
how to approach that security correctly.

24
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,100
Especially from the human
element, right, the theme of this.

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,280
Too often folks really try
to bifurcate the community,

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,040
and it's appropriate to treat IT

27
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,190
and OT security differently,

28
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,129
but it's not good to actually treat us all

29
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,490
like we're not the right people,

30
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,500
or like you don't have the
right people in the team.

31
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,490
You can approach it differently

32
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,580
and it's still all the same community.

33
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,260
Especially, when you start
talking about the lack

34
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,093
of visibility we have.

35
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,840
Most companies aren't monitoring

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,660
in their industrial networks
or industrial environments

37
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,580
to even see what's going on, so to pretend

38
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,200
that something is not
facing us is quite silly.

39
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,410
If we hear about a threat,
we should take that and go,

40
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,940
okay, well, is it my environment?

41
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,490
Is it relevant to my industry?

42
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,509
What were the lessons learned?"

43
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,680
And, even if it's not,

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,900
what can we learn from that anyways,

45
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,540
as we start approaching
our industrial security.

46
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,550
A lot of folks want to do asset inventory,

47
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,820
which is not a bad thing, it makes sense,

48
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,009
but it's not just about the inventory,

49
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,540
it's about how everything's communicating,

50
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,820
the topology of it, like what's going on?

51
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,830
So we can actually understand
if there are threats or risks,

52
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,110
and how to get ahead of it,

53
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,170
and I think that we're struggling on that.

54
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,070
We're getting better,
community's doing good overall,

55
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,460
but it's slow.

56
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,210
And I would say probably the other piece

57
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,869
is a lot of folks don't
understand this side of the world,

58
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,880
so they want to flavor it to
something they do understand.

59
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,710
So, we see industrial commonly
getting called as, it's IoT.

60
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,350
Well, all those weird stuff, it's IoT,

61
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,690
but there's no better way

62
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,580
to piss off the plant operations folks

63
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,717
than walking in and be like,
"Oh, yeah, you're IoT."

64
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,317
And like, "No, that's Alexa.

65
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,940
"Gas turbines a little bit different."

66
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,280
And we need to make sure
we approach it that way.

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,930
So, here's what I think
will be the short-term,

68
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,180
the mid-term, and the long-term in this.

69
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,490
The short term is we're
gonna go get more visibility

70
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,429
than we've ever had before.

71
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,770
And it's gonna look
like this hockey stick,

72
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,240
that things are getting real bad.

73
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,047
And then, I go and tell
people, like, "Calm down,

74
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,710
"it's actually a maturity curve."

75
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,880
Because we are looking
more, we are seeing more.

76
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,930
So, it's not that our asset
owners, and power, and water,

77
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,870
and oil and gas, and folks
aren't doing good work,

78
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,710
it's they're doing more work than ever,

79
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,690
so it's gonna look real
bad in the short-term.

80
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,470
Now, in the medium-term, I
do want people to be ready

81
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,730
for what bad can look like.

82
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,440
We have threats that are
trying to kill people.

83
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
We have threats that
have shown the ability

84
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,710
to take down electric
power, it's gonna happen.

85
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,540
And my fear is that we
overreact in the fear.

86
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,250
We try to regulate away the industry

87
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,760
or just really freak out.

88
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,870
And the reality is, it's
gonna happen eventually,

89
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,150
but we have such good
asset owners and operators,

90
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,410
and a good community that
we're going to be okay.

91
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,420
Maybe a 30 minute outage isn't the thing

92
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,470
to really freak out
about and overreact on.

93
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,080
So, it's going to happen,
so be ready for it.

94
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,610
But in the long-term, the
thing that I really want us

95
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,390
to get ahead of is we
are having an industry

96
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,450
that is becoming way
more connected than ever,

97
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,239
and it's becoming more homogeneous.

98
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,370
The ability to do attack in
one location versus another

99
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,550
used to be really, really hard.

100
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,550
It's getting easier.

101
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,450
That's not a this-year problem,

102
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,299
that's not a next-year problem,

103
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,020
that's a five to 10-year challenge,

104
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,370
but we're gonna hit this inflection point.

105
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,200
And right now, we're only
dealing with state actors

106
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
'cause it's a lot of investment.

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,090
You make that inflection
point, you start dealing

108
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,090
with criminal and other non-state actors.

109
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,210
That's gonna be bad.

110
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,140
So, it's not, "Oh my god, we're
all gonna die, go do work."

111
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,946
It's, "Hey, we can see where we're going.

112
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:21,780
"Let's get ahead of it."

113
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,560
Let's make sure that we're
good for the long-term.

114
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,500
That's why we want to put
the stuff in place now,

115
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,490
just make sure our
communities are taken care of.

116
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,710
Oh, I love the people, and
so I think it's in theme

117
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,910
of the human element, but nobody paid me,

118
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,006
slipped me, be like, "Human element!"

119
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,500
But, honestly, I see
a lot of conversations

120
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,800
around RSA in general, and
I've always loved coming here

121
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,990
because it's the designated
to conference to go hang out

122
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,150
with all the people you like
and see every every time.

123
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,360
There's so many people here

124
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,830
that are in my community,
industrial, which you never think

125
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,020
of RSA, the enterprise
security conference,

126
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,900
as having anything industrial,

127
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,840
and yet if the world is
industrial, then, yeah,

128
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
we're all still here anyways.

129
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,000
And so, it was really, really
cool to see all the customers,

130
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,080
see all our partners,
our friends and peers,

131
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,610
and, yeah, it's a little
bit of just excitement

132
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,532
for the community in general.

133
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,615
(gentle piano music)
