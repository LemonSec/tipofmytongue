1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,099
>> ANNOUNCER: And now,
please welcome President RSA,

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,933
Rohit Ghai.

3
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,399
>> ROHIT GHAI: Good
morning fellow humans.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,166
What is it that makes us human?

5
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,300
Our opposable thumbs, the size
of our brains, the fact that we

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:34,233
can pass the Turing
test, or something else?

7
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,132
Since the dawn of our species,
we have gathered around fires

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,333
and told stories.

9
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,166
We are biologically
hardwired for stories.

10
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,699
Opposable thumbs let us hang on.

11
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:49,733
Our stories tell us
what to hang on to.

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,466
Stories make us human.

13
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,733
We created language, used it to
capture information first on

14
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,033
cave walls, then
books, now computers.

15
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:02,733
We were the first species to
figure out how to pass facts

16
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,500
and stories to our next
generations outside of what was

17
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,866
encoded in our genes.

18
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:14,065
Facts help us understand the
world as it is but it is stories

19
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:17,566
that help us imagine
the world as it can be.

20
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:21,765
And it's ultimately this
wanderlust for the future that

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,765
changes the world.

22
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:29,900
Stories have a profound
impact on the way we feel,

23
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,065
think and act.

24
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,699
They move us.

25
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,666
"To Kill a Mockingbird" moved
readers to view the world

26
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,966
from the eyes of a young person
facing racial and social

27
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:45,233
injustice and catalyzed
the civil rights movement.

28
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:52,799
In 1977, three brilliant minds,
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len

29
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:57,299
Adelman humanized the narrative
in their famous paper by giving

30
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,000
names to the human characters.

31
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:03,433
They talked about Bob and
Alice's need to have a secret

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,466
conversation which ignited the
imagination of cryptographers.

33
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:12,099
Now, this particular story
created an iconic company, an

34
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,466
industry, and a conference.

35
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,232
Meanwhile, Bob and Alice
are still hanging out in

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,266
cryptography papers.

37
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:24,399
Now, I am honored to welcome
the good humans in the story of

38
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:29,466
cybersecurity to
RSA Conference 2020.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,866
Now, we appreciate
your participation despite

40
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:40,965
the circumstances.

41
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,533
And I want to convey my thanks
to Mayor London Breed and her

42
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,132
office for collaborating with
our conference team to ensure a

43
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,733
healthy and safe event for all.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,166
Now, you may have also heard
about an update to the story

45
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,433
of RSA.

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,333
Last week, Symphony Technology
Group announced that it is

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,633
acquiring RSA and we are excited
about a future with them.

48
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,599
Now, while this does represent a
change, what will never change

49
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,698
is our commitment to our
customers and partners, as well

50
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:18,166
as how seriously we take our
privilege to bring the industry

51
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:21,199
together at this conference
like we have for the last

52
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,166
three decades.

53
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,366
Our conference theme this
year is the Human Element.

54
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:31,533
And what better way to discuss
this than to review the story of

55
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,366
our industry, paying
particular attention to the

56
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,833
human characters.

57
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,466
Yuval Noah Harari, author of
"Sapiens" and a masterful

58
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:45,833
storyteller of our era has
talked about how the advent of

59
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,300
artificial intelligence will
create a new class of humans,

60
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:53,666
the useless class, those
that are not just unemployed

61
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,000
but unemployable.

62
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:00,366
In this data-centric world with
advanced AI, will the humans of

63
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,198
cybersecurity matter?

64
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:06,632
Now, I don't know about you guys
but the only time I am okay

65
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,599
being labeled as useless
is the weekend after the

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,233
RSA Conference.

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,199
I am so tired and so
giddy at the same time.

68
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,333
Quite useless, actually.

69
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,633
Now, AI is now everywhere.

70
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,500
Frito Lay is using AI to
build better potato chips.

71
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,599
We have already seen
adversarial AI in action in a

72
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:34,332
well-publicized story where an
AI-based deepfake audio mimicked

73
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,899
the voice of an executive to
dupe the CEO of a utility

74
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:41,166
company into initiating
a big wire transfer.

75
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,366
We are leveraging AI models to
reduce fraud in billions of card

76
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:51,033
not present transactions via the
EMV 3DS version 2.2 protocol.

77
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:56,866
We're also leveraging AI to
process data from networks,

78
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:01,533
logs, end points, and all facets
of the attack surface to make

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,933
the human analyst and
the SOC more effective.

80
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:10,899
So, AI is clearly augmenting the
attacker and the defender but

81
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,699
will not make either useless.

82
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,533
AI itself is vulnerable to
cyber-attacks, data poisoning

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,199
during the learning or
the inference phase.

84
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:25,566
So, while the AI will be busy
making some subset of the humans

85
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:31,066
useless, we will make ourselves
useful defending AI and other

86
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,500
useful humans.

87
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,765
Humans are absolutely
here to stay in the story

88
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,899
of cybersecurity.

89
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:44,500
Now, a story has a backdrop,
narrator, actors and observers.

90
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:47,465
Two thousand years ago,
Aristotle identified the

91
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,033
elements of a great story.

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,600
Pity, fear, catharsis.

93
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,500
The narrator depicts a struggle
in which the observer feels pity

94
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,866
and gets emotionally entangled
with the one struggling.

95
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:04,466
The jeopardy escalates,
instilling fear in the heart of

96
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,766
the observer.

97
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,366
The resolution drives emotional
catharsis which delivers

98
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:13,366
dopamine to the observer's
brain and it lands the story in

99
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,099
their head.

100
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:20,166
Yuval Harari says the impact of
a story is more correlated to

101
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:25,933
how many heads it lives inside
rather than how real it is.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,266
So, to change our future,
we must change and spread

103
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,199
our story.

104
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,733
Step one, let's understand
the story we have.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,300
Step two, contrast
that with our reality.

106
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:43,699
Step three, agree on the story
we want and land it in lots

107
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:44,433
of heads.

108
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,599
So, let's get into
the story we had.

109
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,933
Our early story was simple.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,966
The backdrop?

111
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,866
Deep in the bowels
of the data center.

112
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,766
Attacker versus defender.

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,300
Technologist versus
technologist.

114
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:02,699
Not many observers at this point
and it was us, the defender,

115
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,233
narrating the story.

116
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,399
Now, as technology
became pervasive, our story

117
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,600
became mainstream.

118
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:15,266
The backdrop, a pervasive
technology infrastructure, core

119
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,699
edge Cloud.

120
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,533
Technology not just in data
centers and in Cloud but with

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,533
the advent of 5G,
pretty much everywhere.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,633
In televisions, cars,
shower heads, on our bodies,

123
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,633
in our bodies.

124
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:35,765
The World Economic Forum's
Global Risk Report 2020 was

125
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,000
recently released in Davos.

126
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,399
It included the Global Risk
Perception Survey to measure

127
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:45,533
which global risks are likely
to increase going forward.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,500
Cyber-attacks in the top
five along with economic

129
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:53,332
confrontations between major
powers, domestic, political

130
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,866
polarization, extreme
heat waves and destruction of

131
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,666
natural ecosystems.

132
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,933
Quite a list to be on.

133
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:07,600
Now, 76% of respondents
believe cyber risk will increase

134
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,633
in 2020.

135
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,000
Through our customers,
we at RSA have the world's

136
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,633
largest risk database.

137
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,266
We recently conducted a survey
of risk officers in the most

138
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:24,266
highly regulated industries
and published the RSA digital

139
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,300
risk report.

140
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,366
The top three risks,
cyber-attack risk, dynamic

141
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:31,233
workforce risk,
data privacy risk.

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,765
So, clearly our story
has global mind share.

143
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,000
But we have lost control
of the narrative.

144
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,566
And the mainstream media now
owns the story and is still

145
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,633
depicting it as a
technical conflict.

146
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,299
The story has a few new
characters, the users and

147
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,500
the business.

148
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,100
And here is how
it is being told.

149
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,333
Business leaders worldwide are
concerned about cyber-attacks as

150
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,566
a strong and well-organized
cyber force of hackers use their

151
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:09,133
technical prowess to wreak havoc
on understaffed and burned out

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,266
security teams.

153
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,299
The users, who should be the
first line of defense, are not

154
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:18,333
technically savvy enough and are
being manipulated with social

155
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,433
engineering attacks, making the
job of security professionals

156
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,166
even harder.

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,333
That's our current story.

158
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,433
The story evokes pity for the
security team, fear from the

159
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
hackers, and catharsis
feels pretty far away.

160
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:39,866
While we have focused
on preventing hacks on

161
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,000
infrastructure, the adversary
has hacked our brains and

162
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,566
cranked up the
contrast in our story.

163
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:50,466
The Zeitgeist has an overly
simplified and incomplete view

164
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,633
of the humans in our story.

165
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:57,366
All hackers are
technical sorcerers.

166
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:01,200
All users, old gullible
folks with technophobia.

167
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:05,665
And we are hapless techies
who solely focus on zero-day

168
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:10,465
vulnerabilities and the most
advanced threat vectors.

169
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,133
Let's dissect the truth.

170
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,899
Look, the hackers have done
a great job of technical

171
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:18,700
collaboration to create an
arsenal of cyber weapons that

172
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,833
enable the technically less
sophisticated to inflict a lot

173
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,966
of harm.

174
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,833
At this point in fact, there are
more script kiddies than there

175
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,899
are technically savvy hackers.

176
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,399
They have recruited
exceptionally well and have

177
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:33,833
assembled massive
human and bot armies.

178
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,899
Seventy-one percent of the
threat actors and breaches are

179
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,833
financially motivated.

180
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,533
Use of stolen credentials is
more than 60% of the top hacking

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,033
action varieties.

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,200
And as the Verizon breach
report states, utilizing valid

183
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:52,000
credentials to
pop web applications is not

184
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,833
exactly avantgarde.

185
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,266
The highest increase in threat
actions was social engineering

186
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,933
and the human asset was the
highest growing target asset

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,133
category from 2013 to 2018.

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,966
Look, their advantage is not
that they have the best tech or

189
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,500
the best techies.

190
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:18,033
Their advantage is that
they're more organized.

191
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,100
Now we, the security
professionals, are living this

192
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:25,299
cognitive dissonance where we
understand this, but we continue

193
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:29,699
our technology arms race and
keep looking for techies to

194
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:33,766
staff up our teams, creating a
self-inflicted talent gap and

195
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,500
burn out.

196
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:39,233
We continue to spend an
inordinate amount of energy

197
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,833
preparing for the most
sophisticated threat vectors,

198
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,533
while most incidents occur due
to very, very basic issues or

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,433
unforced errors.

200
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,200
Look, preparing for the
worst does not prepare you for

201
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,733
the likely.

202
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,566
The burnout issue is real.

203
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,866
A recent report across
France, Germany and the UK

204
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,600
reveals cybersecurity
professionals are

205
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,666
falling behind.

206
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,399
Too much complexity, too many
distractions, too much noise.

207
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,866
Two in five reported concerns
that they would be held

208
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,899
personally liable
for a data breach.

209
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,233
Just over half feared
dismissal if a breach happened

210
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:19,299
on their watch.

211
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:23,366
The vast majority of CISOs say
they rarely disconnect from

212
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,500
their job.

213
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,733
We also have a more inflated
view of how organized we are.

214
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,933
We are certainly
collaborating better among

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,733
security professionals.

216
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,500
The cyber threat alliance and
the NSA open sourcing the Ghidra

217
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,399
tool, fantastic examples.

218
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:46,666
But we are not organized well
to collaborate with the users,

219
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,899
business, risk, and IT teams.

220
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,366
On the user front, the story
does not match reality.

221
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:59,033
According to Pew Research,
millennials may be cyber savvy

222
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,266
but they are not cyber security
savvy and are more likely than

223
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,966
baby boomers to get phished.

224
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:09,500
We're also missing some
actors in the story.

225
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:14,166
The great news is business
leaders, directors on boards,

226
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,733
risk officers are now keenly
interested in our story, but

227
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,366
they're on the sidelines
asking questions, seeking

228
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,000
to understand.

229
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:26,299
IT does not even figure in the
story because they're focused on

230
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:29,799
scripting and owning the story
of digital transformation.

231
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:38,099
I submit, IT, business, and risk
leaders are largely observers in

232
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,899
our story and not actors.

233
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:48,766
The story we want is a business
story of cyber resilience, not a

234
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,632
technical story of
cyber ping pong.

235
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,899
The backdrop is not
cyberspace at all.

236
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,500
It is our physical space.

237
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:58,700
It is our organic world viewed
not from the perspective of the

238
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:03,065
digital technology instrumented
into it but from the lens of the

239
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,033
human experiences
that technology enables.

240
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:11,266
The struggle that engenders pity
and fear is not the struggle of

241
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,366
the defender.

242
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,933
It is the struggle
the protected.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,966
The catharsis is not the
eventual creation of an

244
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:22,399
unhackable world but the magical
humanistic outcomes of digital

245
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,966
transformation despite hacks.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,633
To change our story, we need
to do three things, reclaim our

247
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,700
narrative, reorganize our
defense and rethink our culture.

248
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:42,500
The story we want to reclaim is
not the one we tell each other

249
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:46,266
but the one that others not in
our industry tell about us.

250
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,733
And we don't have to get them to
believe that we are successful.

251
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,165
We just need to get them
to believe that we can be.

252
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,566
Belief in winnability is
important for winning.

253
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,033
And in order to do this, we must
engage the media and spread our

254
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,000
voice through them.

255
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:08,799
We need to leverage social
media platforms to amplify

256
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,733
our winnability.

257
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,000
Now, I know, I know, I know.

258
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,899
We are strong and silent types.

259
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:18,700
This is going to be
hard for us, but we must.

260
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,833
The media has been telling our
story based on what we have been

261
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,366
telling them or
not telling them.

262
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,600
No wonder we're depicted in the
media as losers because all we

263
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,100
share is our losses.

264
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,966
We don't share any wins not
because we don't have any, but

265
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:37,766
because we fear it will divulge
our security posture or perhaps

266
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,733
make us complacent or
paint a target on our back.

267
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,500
Look, we certainly can share our
collective successes even if we

268
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,399
don't share our individual ones.

269
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:52,033
We need to share our wins
and losses of our adversary.

270
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,700
By the way, the two
are not synonymous.

271
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:58,799
We don't have to win for
the attacker to lose.

272
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:01,299
We don't have to win for
the attacker to lose.

273
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:04,533
Take the example of
the City of Atlanta.

274
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,233
When the city faced a ransomware
attack, it cost them millions of

275
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,233
dollars to restore service.

276
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:11,399
Not a win for them.

277
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:15,433
However, the city made a
courageous call to not pay

278
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,066
ransom to the adversary.

279
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:21,565
Now, while this may not work
every time, when we deny the

280
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:27,133
attackers financial gain, they
lose since 70% of them are

281
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,899
financially motivated.

282
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,500
The hackers are bound by the
same laws of economics everyone

283
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:32,500
else is.

284
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:37,466
The City of Atlanta did not
win, but the hackers lost.

285
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,033
The city did a great job of
highlighting this and in

286
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,633
response to the attack, built a
robust business continuity plan

287
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,100
as part of their integrated
risk management program.

288
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,666
An eventual win.

289
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:54,399
They realized winning is not
about avoiding cyber-attacks but

290
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:58,166
business resilience
despite them.

291
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,532
Owning our story will
have tremendous benefits.

292
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,333
It will help with burn out.

293
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,665
We have ignored the psychology
of the defender to focus on the

294
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,566
technology of the defender.

295
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:12,966
We have a hard time recruiting
because no one wants to join a

296
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,132
losing team.

297
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,665
Owning our story will also
preserve trust in technology.

298
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:24,766
We need to get better organized
and resketch the roles

299
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,233
of all the actors in our story.

300
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,599
Any defense that expects to work
needs strategy and context.

301
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,166
Business stakeholders, the board
and the risk office, need to be

302
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:39,599
thought of not as keenly
interested observers but actors

303
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,299
in the story.

304
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:44,000
They are the
zeroth line of defense.

305
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,433
They need to set strategy and
provide context to security

306
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,266
operations so they can focus
on the risks that matter most.

307
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:56,533
Goldman Sachs recently said
they will not manage IPOs for

308
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,066
companies with no gender
diversity on the board.

309
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:06,366
I look forward to the day when
boards mandate cyber competency

310
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:10,433
as a core capability in addition
to the focus on diversity.

311
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:14,900
I also look forward to the day
when every Chief Risk Officer

312
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:19,166
can quantify and explain cyber
risk and partner with the CISO

313
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,299
to manage it by
providing business context to

314
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:23,566
security programs.

315
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:28,299
All right, onto the first line
of defense which functions to

316
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,099
reduce the attack surface.

317
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:36,233
The case of Typhoid Mary
in 1906 can be instructive.

318
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,700
In the summer of 1906, several
members of the very wealthy

319
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:44,866
Warren household fell ill with
Typhoid, a disease atypical in

320
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,000
wealthy households.

321
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,066
Upon investigation, it was
discovered that the cook at the

322
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:53,500
household, Mary Mallon,
was responsible.

323
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,400
She had a tragic flaw.

324
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:59,632
She was an excellent cook
who did not wash her hands.

325
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:05,832
In this example, accountability
for hygiene rested not just with

326
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,766
the Warrens but with Mary.

327
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,766
She came to be known as
Typhoid Mary and was apprehended

328
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,766
and quarantined.

329
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,633
In our world of
cybersecurity, it is

330
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,766
unreasonable to call our end
users the first line of defense

331
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,200
and hold them solely
responsible and accountable for

332
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,033
cyber hygiene.

333
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,399
We need to consider the people
who cook the food rather than

334
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,733
those who consume it.

335
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:39,166
For far too long, we have failed
to hold IT and software makers

336
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:43,399
accountable for cyber
hygiene and vulnerabilities.

337
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:46,565
We keep getting embroiled in
this quagmire of liability

338
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,966
litigation and have believed
that market forces will

339
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:54,166
naturally punish the software
makers who do not reduce their

340
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,466
attack surface.

341
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,733
This has proven to
be wishful thinking.

342
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:02,266
Yes, we need to continue to
educate the users, but it is

343
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:09,700
time to invite IT to our story
as primary characters acting as

344
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,833
the first line of defense.

345
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,099
This is especially true in the
world of edge computing where

346
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,700
the technology
footprint is pervasive.

347
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,666
With the advent of DevOps,
the speed of software, and

348
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,366
therefore, vulnerability
creation is exponential.

349
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,233
Look, no disrespect
intended to IT.

350
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,933
IT is certainly cooking up
delicious digital recipes, but

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,133
they better wash their hands
and be accountable for reducing

352
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,633
cyber exposure.

353
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:46,766
Finally, we need to rethink
our culture and shift from a

354
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:51,066
culture of elitism to
a culture of inclusion.

355
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,766
Expanding our talent pool,
filling the talent gap, however

356
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,666
you look at it, requires
finding defenders outside the

357
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:58,433
tech community.

358
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,799
Let's stop being STEM snobs.

359
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,466
One untapped resource for us is
neurodiversity which is simply

360
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,699
being wired differently.

361
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,633
They can bring new perspectives
to the company's efforts to

362
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
create or recognize value.

363
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,799
They problem solve
in different ways.

364
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:19,000
The neuro diverse population
remains a largely untapped

365
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:22,933
talent pool with unemployment
running as high as 80%.

366
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:27,733
Generations experience the world
and each other differently.

367
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,466
The accelerating rate of change
in society creates a gap.

368
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:35,733
Right now, there are seven
generations in the US.

369
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,533
Seven.

370
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,166
Five of them in the workforce.

371
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,166
Each with a unique set of
characteristics and norms.

372
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:45,166
And we need to harness this
entire spectrum and be open to

373
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,866
considering potential and not
just expertise when we hire.

374
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:53,832
We need to collaborate, not just
within security teams but with

375
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,966
business, risk, IT and users.

376
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:01,099
Let's change our culture to a
culture of perfection, to a

377
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,566
culture of pragmatism.

378
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:06,066
Don't let perfect be
the enemy of the good.

379
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,400
Look, I am not saying we should
lower our standards, but let's

380
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:12,199
prioritize based on risk.

381
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:14,866
Let's take care of the basic
issues like multifactor

382
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,599
authentication.

383
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:20,066
A best of breed strategy that
puts three monitors with five

384
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:24,099
Windows each on the desk of a
security analyst may make them

385
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:29,866
feel like technical wizards but
will never help us keep up with

386
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,099
the velocity of threats.

387
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,500
So, there you
have it, folks.

388
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:41,099
If we successfully change
our story, we have a shot at

389
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:45,299
changing our world to the one
we want, a trust enabled world.

390
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:49,400
In this world, we will certainly
use technology to protect

391
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:53,265
technology and recruit machines
to fight the good fight.

392
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:59,266
But intrinsically, this will
remain a story about us; humans

393
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,966
will remain at the
center of our story.

394
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:07,966
In this world, the defenders
will be better organized than

395
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:13,099
the attackers and the spirit of
the defender will be strong.

396
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:16,133
We will not go into battle
believing that we are going

397
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,599
to lose.

398
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:21,133
In this world, we will restore
and preserve trust in digital

399
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,200
technologies by successfully
managing cyber and digital risk.

400
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,666
To be clear, it will not be
a world without intrusions

401
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:31,733
and breaches.

402
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,066
But it will be one where the
impact of those breaches does

403
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,966
not get in the way
of human progress.

404
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,233
So, whatever fire it is that you
gather around, and whichever way

405
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,066
it is that you tell our story,
make sure it's the right one.

406
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,233
You are the humans of
cybersecurity, the keepers of

407
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,700
our story.

408
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:59,866
And when the fire is long gone
and so are we, it is our story

409
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,799
that will stay behind.

410
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:05,900
And if it is the right one, it
will guide those after us on the

411
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,866
right path.

412
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,866
It will tell them
what to hold onto.

413
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:16,700
We are only as good as
the story we leave behind.

414
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,700
Thank you.

415
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,833
(Applause)
