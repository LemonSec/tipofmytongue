1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,710
- In the long term, the
thing that I really wanted

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,430
to get ahead of, is we
are having an industry

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,480
that is becoming way
more connected than ever,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,270
and it's becoming more homogeneous.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,410
The ability to do an attack
on one location versus another

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,590
used to be really, really hard.

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,600
It's getting easier.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,500
That's not a this year problem,

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,350
that's not a next year problem,

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,080
that's a five to 10 year challenge

12
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,430
but we're going to hit
this inflection point

13
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,230
and right now we're only
dealing with state actors

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,790
'cause it's a lot of investment.

15
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,759
You make that inflection point,

16
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,130
you start dealing with criminal
and other non state actors,

17
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,259
that's gonna be bad.

18
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,960
So, it's not, "Oh my god,

19
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,180
we're all going to die, go do work",

20
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,070
It's, "Hey, we can see where we're going,

21
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,650
let's get ahead of it,
let's make sure we're good

22
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,620
for the long term".

23
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,540
That's why we want to put
this stuff in place now,

24
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,926
just to make sure our
communities are taken care of.

25
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,343
