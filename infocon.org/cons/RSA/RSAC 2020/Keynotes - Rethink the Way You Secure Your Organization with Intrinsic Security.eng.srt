1
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,733
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Chief Operating

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,833
Officer of VMWare,
Sanjay Poonen.

3
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:13,833
>> SANJAY POONEN:
Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,933
How are you doing?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
Great to see you all and
the wonderful security

6
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:22,133
professionals here at RSA
and thirty thousand people

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,899
at this conference.

8
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:27,199
I know coronavirus is on
many of our hands - our

9
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,366
minds, so our thoughts
and prayers with everyone

10
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:33,066
across the world that are,
you know, wrestling with

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,066
this, including in China.

12
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,399
What we wanted to do, I
love these twenty-minute

13
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,266
type keynotes because
they are crisp.

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,233
We really wanted to
feature a practitioner.

15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,799
So, you're going to see in
a few minutes, we're going

16
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,966
to bring up a wonderful
security leader from

17
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,299
Southwest Airlines.

18
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,333
I just wanted to set the
tone a little bit for what

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,700
we see are some of the key
things in the industry

20
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,266
that I want to challenge
all of us, because we

21
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,166
think this is a group
and a team sport.

22
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,166
We need an entire village
to really kind of step up

23
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,933
our game in security.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,900
As we know, sort of
this notion of ransomware

25
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,199
is on the rise.

26
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,066
You just have to look at
the number of headlines

27
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,033
and the types of things
that have happened as a

28
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,700
result of breaches that
result in physical money.

29
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:15,200
At some point in time, it
is also going to affect

30
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,266
more than just money, as a
combination of organized

31
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,000
crime or nation
states step up here.

32
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:24,433
And we think this requires
a new approach because

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,066
there is a fantastic
landscape of security

34
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:27,966
vendors, you know.

35
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,166
You just have to look at
the show floor and this

36
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,166
conference, at black hat,
five thousand vendors.

37
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:36,599
But honestly, if you went
to a doctor and you asked

38
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,166
her, how do you stay
healthy and she said

39
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,366
you've got to have five
thousand tablets, you just

40
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,233
couldn't do that.

41
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,433
So, how do you do this in
the healthcare industry?

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,366
You basically focus on
your diet, your proteins,

43
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:49,266
your vegetables, your
water, and you bake it in.

44
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,700
So, this requires, we
think, a new approach that

45
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,633
is intrinsic, not
something that is bolted

46
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,366
on, something that is
siloed, or something that

47
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,566
is very threat centric,
but something that is

48
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,765
fundamentally more built
in, more intrinsic,

49
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,200
something that is a lot
more unified and something

50
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,400
that is a lot more
context aware.

51
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,199
That new approach is
something that the

52
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,099
industry needs to have.

53
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,333
Now, all of you in the
enterprise world think

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
about these types of
layers, your Cloud,

55
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,666
private and public Cloud;
your applications, whether

56
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,599
it is traditional apps or
container or SAAS apps;

57
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,698
and your device world.

58
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,433
That is today, the
nice framework.

59
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,800
And security has to be
layered into this, where

60
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:33,699
increasingly across all
of those, you pick the

61
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:36,266
control points and you
focus on intrinsic

62
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,466
security there.

63
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,232
So, let's look at the
control points in each

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,233
of those layers.

65
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,333
The bottom layer in Cloud,
you typically have two or

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
three very important
control points.

67
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,566
It all starts with network
security, one of the

68
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,500
biggest aspects
of security.

69
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,633
Security has to be a lot
more intrinsic there.

70
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,800
You can't build point
tools for data centers and

71
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,266
then load balancing and
firewalls and SD-WAN.

72
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,066
It has to be a
lot more unified.

73
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,633
The same thing
with workload.

74
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,233
Workload is a form of
an endpoint, servers or

75
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,433
containers, and then
of course traditional

76
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,300
endpoints now play up to
the device side of things.

77
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,866
There is identity which
has to be in different

78
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,400
forms there, and then
finally, sort of Cloud.

79
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,666
These key areas then
surround enormous amounts

80
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,933
of telemetry that
is collected.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,400
We think these five or six
areas are the key control

82
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,500
points that security
has to be more and more

83
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,366
naturally built into
platforms as opposed to

84
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,033
point tool, point
tool, point tool.

85
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,266
I think that helps you.

86
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,400
We would like to also
make you aware of a

87
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,099
cybersecurity report that
we did some research on.

88
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,099
It is available.

89
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,099
I will talk more about it.

90
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,500
You can download this or
get this from the web.

91
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,900
We found a couple of
things from research we

92
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,000
did over thousands of
CISOs we surveyed.

93
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,800
Number one, we're
finding that behavior on

94
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,366
the attacker side is
becoming a lot more

95
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,766
focused in evasive
techniques.

96
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,766
You probably, you know,
you would imagine that,

97
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,366
but that is
becoming very clear.

98
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,799
And we're seeing a
resurgence of ransomware.

99
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:07,099
Now, from the defender
side, there is a real call

100
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,633
for IT teams, corporate IT
teams and security teams

101
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,933
to work a lot more
together as opposed to in

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,533
different silos.

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,433
So, as we do this, we want
you to be comfortable with

104
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,300
knowing, listen, I will
talk a little bit at the

105
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,399
end of this, so sort of
VMWare's vision of what

106
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,733
we're trying to get done.

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,199
But it is my pleasure at
this point in time to

108
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,800
bring out two individuals.

109
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,000
The first one just
joined VMWARE recently.

110
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,133
He is the former
CEO of Carbon Black.

111
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,800
He is now the head of our
security business,

112
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,000
Patrick Morley.

113
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,666
And the real guest of this
show, of the conversation,

114
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,899
Carrie Mills who is a
security leader at an

115
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,800
incredible brand,
Southwest Airlines.

116
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,399
Patrick and Carrie,
come on stage.

117
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,066
Carrie, thanks
for being with us.

118
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:49,899
>> CARRIE MILLS:
Thank you.

119
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,066
>> SANJAY POONEN:
Patric take it away.

120
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,666
>> PATRICK MORLEY:
Thank you very much.

121
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,366
All right.

122
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,533
Well, good morning
everybody.

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,933
I came to my first RSA
Conference in 2002.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,166
It was much smaller
than it is now.

125
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,699
I have never been
on a keynote stage,

126
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,699
so this is awesome.

127
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,066
It's great to be
with you, Carrie.

128
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:14,500
So, we wanted to just talk
about how a practitioner

129
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,965
views the world right now.

130
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,600
And so, I thought maybe we
would just start with what

131
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,100
Sanjay was just talking
about on that security report.

132
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,600
And I know we discussed
that a little bit backstage.

133
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,933
Any impressions from
that security report?

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,666
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah, so
I got a sneak preview of

135
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,133
the security report
before it was published.

136
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,333
And really, the defender
portion of the report

137
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,300
really resonated with me.

138
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:41,099
We are executing against
consolidated IT management

139
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,899
and security strategies,
and during that, we need

140
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,100
to learn how to
breakdown the silos.

141
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,332
Our infrastructure team
and our security team

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,766
always have competing
priorities, but as these

143
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,699
intrinsic security starts
to be implemented across

144
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,699
our platforms,
we have to learn how to

145
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,399
work better together.

146
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,733
As Sanjay stated,
security is a team sport.

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,933
Some of the things that I
do at Southwest Airlines

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,466
to help foster positive
relationships with the

149
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,699
infrastructure team and
application teams, where

150
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:16,633
our security is
taking place, it is

151
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,600
just simple things.

152
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,699
It's swinging by their
office and saying hello.

153
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,333
It is saying hey,
do you want to go grab a

154
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,433
cup of coffee?

155
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,766
Let's see what
is going on.

156
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,533
Learn about
their families.

157
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,833
So, I have been trying
to build positive

158
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,199
relationships with my
peers and also encourage

159
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,600
my team members to go
create those positive

160
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,600
relationships
with their peers.

161
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,366
Since security
is a team sport,

162
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,699
we have security incidents.

163
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,899
And when you have a large
security incident that you

164
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,100
have to deal with, the
first people that you need

165
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,666
on your team are those
infrastructure teams and

166
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:48,966
those application
team members.

167
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,699
And if you have a positive
relationship with them,

168
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:54,266
it's going to make it a
lot less stressful when

169
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,333
you are dealing with
a security incident.

170
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,033
>> PATRICK MORLEY: So, one
of the stats, I asked you

171
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,333
this about - backstage.

172
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,000
One of the stats on the
study that I was surprised

173
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:06,299
it was so high was 77% of
the respondents said we

174
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:09,800
actually don't - SecOps
and IT Ops actually don't

175
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,800
engage that well and don't
necessarily get along.

176
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,832
I asked you about that.

177
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,766
I thought your response
was interesting.

178
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,566
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah, I
wasn't surprised by the stat.

179
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,233
There is always - we have
conflicting priorities

180
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,633
that we're trying
to deal with.

181
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:23,966
You know, the
infrastructure team is

182
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:26,100
trying to keep the network
up and running, keep our

183
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,466
servers running, and the
security team is trying to

184
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,133
chase after them and make
sure everything they're

185
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,199
implementing is secure.

186
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:36,000
So, it creates some
friction between the teams.

187
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,899
So, the stat didn't
surprise me at all.

188
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,366
But that is also - that is
not a stat that I want to

189
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,733
have at Southwest
Airlines.

190
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,266
I want to build those
relationships and make

191
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,866
sure it is positive
because we're all working

192
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,199
towards the same goal.

193
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,166
>> PATRICK MORLEY: So,
Southwest Airlines

194
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:55,333
obviously is a very
recognizable brand.

195
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,933
You are on the Board
of the Aviation ISAC.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,633
I think it gives you a
really good perspective on

197
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,399
what is happening across
certainly the aviation

198
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:09,866
industry but also across
threats globally.

199
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,966
So, I would be interested
just to understand what

200
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,133
you are seeing right
now, what you and your

201
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,233
colleagues are seeing.

202
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,699
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah, so
as an airline, we have

203
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:20,300
pretty much two different
cybersecurity focuses.

204
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,733
We look at the IT side,
our traditional data

205
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,166
center, servers,
network appliances.

206
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,833
You know, provide the
same security tools and

207
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,700
principles that you guys
are probably applying in

208
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:33,866
your environments.

209
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,000
But we also have the OT
side of the house, our

210
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,666
operating technologies,
and that is where

211
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,665
aircraft comes in.

212
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know if you
know this, but probably

213
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:46,000
starting ten years ago or
more recently, airplanes

214
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,666
now have an IP address.

215
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:49,899
So, we have a security
perspective that we have

216
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:52,066
to try to secure.

217
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,866
So, it is a little
bit different of an

218
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,000
environment than our
traditional IT environment.

219
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,133
So, we have to look and
see, you know, what works

220
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
well on the IT side?

221
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,033
How can we apply that to
the OT side and then learn

222
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,966
how to fill in those gaps?

223
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,766
A very important part of
the Aviation ISAC is that

224
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,165
airlines are trying to
partner together to fill

225
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,299
those gaps because we can
all learn from each other.

226
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,833
All of us are in
this together.

227
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,200
>> PATRICK MORLEY: Is
the airline industry

228
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,233
considered critical
infrastructure?

229
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,733
Many of us - many
industries are

230
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,366
increasingly regulated
from a mandate standpoint.

231
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,500
Are airlines also
in that same bucket?

232
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,299
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yes, we
are critical infrastructure.

233
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,633
We're in the
transportation sector that

234
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,500
is where these ISACs
really formed.

235
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,100
During the Obama
administration, they were

236
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,899
- the ISACs were mandated
for all critical

237
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,066
infrastructure sectors.

238
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,299
So, we about five years
ago started the Aviation ISAC.

239
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:48,399
Some of the challenges
that we're having or

240
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,833
threats that we're seeing
in our environment on the

241
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,766
IT side of the house, it's
probably what everyone

242
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,500
else is facing.

243
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,700
We get a lot of
phishing emails.

244
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,733
You know, we have to
try to educate our team

245
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,899
members on how to protect
themselves, how to not

246
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:01,899
click on the links.

247
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,066
But no matter how many
times we tell them,

248
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,233
someone is still
going to click.

249
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,833
Someone is still going to
enter their credentials.

250
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,033
So, we're hoping that you
know, we have our basic

251
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,799
cybersecurity principles
in place that can help

252
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:16,033
protect our assets when
people do click those links.

253
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,366
Then, really, the
challenge that we're

254
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,100
seeing on the operating
technology side of the

255
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,366
house is just, you know,
how do we address aircraft

256
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,200
cybersecurity and the
ecosystem around it?

257
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,565
By nature, the aircraft is
a very - it was designed

258
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,066
with security in mind.

259
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,899
So, we're more in a state
where we have to trust

260
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,266
that our manufacturers
have secured the equipment

261
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,632
that we get.

262
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,033
And then you know, how do
we verify that all that

263
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,566
cybersecurity is in place,
similar to how we do on

264
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,333
the IT side.

265
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,666
So, we're working
through that as an

266
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,465
industry right now.

267
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,200
>> PATRICK MORLEY: The
example you gave, the

268
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,833
responsibility you have
with the IT side as well

269
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:53,899
as the OT side.

270
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:55,833
Increasingly, that is
certainly what I hear when

271
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,066
I'm talking with
CIOs and CISOs.

272
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,033
It is a little bit
reflective on some of what

273
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,066
Sanjay was just talking
about on the intrinsic

274
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,033
security side.

275
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
It would be great to get
your perspective on that,

276
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,299
what resonates with you on
that, and how you think

277
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,466
about that?

278
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,933
>> CARRIE MILLS: I would
say over the last couple

279
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,100
years, we have been trying to practice intrinsic security.

280
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,633
It's not what we called it
but we've been trying to

281
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,066
look for ways to shrink
our cybersecurity footprint.

282
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,299
How can we leverage the
platforms that maybe the

283
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,433
networking team already
has in place and their

284
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,966
security tools within
those platforms and how do

285
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,733
we get rid of some of the
tools, really the bolt on

286
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,733
cybersecurity technologies
that we have been - we've

287
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,466
implemented over the last
ten to fifteen years.

288
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:41,100
So, really for us, the
intrinsic security is all

289
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,566
about simplification
and finding the correct

290
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,866
balance of when we can
leverage a platform that

291
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:50,266
has security built in or
when we need to buy that tool.

292
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,132
One of the problems
that we are starting to

293
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,166
experience as we're
looking at more of a

294
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:57,866
platform is you know,
who is on first now?

295
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,866
If you think about a
firewall that has security

296
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,566
built into it, you have
the networking team that

297
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,266
is so used to doing
everything within that

298
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,266
firewall that they could
ever do, and now there is

299
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,132
cybersecurity technologies
within that firewall that

300
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,833
they need to take care of.

301
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's not
their expertise.

302
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,233
So, that's an issue that
we're experiencing right

303
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,199
now is finding that
right balance of what

304
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:25,000
traditional infrastructure
tasks need to be done by

305
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,166
the infrastructure team
and then which pieces do

306
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,233
we peel off and have
the security team

307
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:30,866
apply their expertise?

308
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,200
>> PATRICK MORLEY: Of
course, that relates back

309
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:34,799
to the teamwork element
and making sure that the

310
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:38,366
teams are aligned, which
as you drive across

311
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:41,200
multiple teams, having
tool sets that allow those

312
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,899
teams to communicate
together makes a

313
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,399
lot of sense.

314
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,200
So, when you - when you
think about the program

315
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,299
that you are running at
Southwest and again, we

316
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,833
talked a little bit
about this out back.

317
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,100
This is a constant battle.

318
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,366
It is - anyone who is in
this industry knows it is

319
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,366
stressful, you have to
work a lot of hours.

320
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,165
It can be exciting
in different ways.

321
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,199
What's your perspective on
running a great program?

322
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,533
Some of the
tenets of that?

323
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,766
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah,
I think it gets back to

324
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,600
building those
relationships and

325
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,299
maintaining a positive
relationship because when

326
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:15,633
we're at our worst
moments, we're going to

327
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,566
have to rely on the
other teams to help us.

328
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,633
But one thing that we have
been really focusing on

329
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,066
lately is visibility,
knowing what is on our

330
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,566
network, but not just
knowing what is on our

331
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,399
network, knowing what is
on our network and what

332
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:31,166
those assets do, where
they live, what are their

333
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,766
functions, who owns them.

334
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,033
If I have a problem with
it, who do I go talk to?

335
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
So, we're starting
to brand that as

336
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,700
visibility with context.

337
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,799
I think it is very
important to have that

338
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,733
context around your assets
so you actually know

339
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,033
what's in your network or
even in your Cloud environment.

340
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,533
And then another thing
that I focus on, probably

341
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,266
more recently than I
have in the past, is how

342
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,632
critical the partnership
with your vendor partners are.

343
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,733
When we - we're not
usually developing our own

344
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,899
security tools, we're
going and purchasing them.

345
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:06,399
So, if we have an issue in
our environment, we have

346
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:09,100
to heavily rely on
outside parties.

347
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:13,133
And just looking out to
your vendor partners to

348
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,100
help in those issues,
if you have a good

349
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,166
relationship with them, it
is going to go a long way.

350
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,500
So, some of the things
I do to maintain those

351
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:24,399
relationships is just to
touch base often to see

352
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:25,366
what is going on.

353
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,333
If I'm at a conference,
you know, making sure I

354
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,933
make a point to go talk
to those vendors and catch

355
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
up with them.

356
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:34,000
And it really
goes a long way.

357
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,766
And when we're doing RFPs
and we're looking for new

358
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,899
technologies implemented
in our environment, we

359
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,266
really look at the
vendor's culture.

360
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,799
Does their culture
align to what we do?

361
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:48,833
Can we maintain a positive
relationship with them?

362
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,733
So, I think it is a very
important piece of the RFP

363
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,699
process outside of
selecting a technology.

364
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:57,199
>> PATRICK MORLEY: You
have talked a lot about

365
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:01,199
teamwork across the aisle
with IT leaders in your

366
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,366
organization as well
as with vendors.

367
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:04,333
What about up?

368
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,433
What about with the executive team, with the board?

369
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,666
How do you - how does
that work at Southwest?

370
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,699
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah,
that relationship to us is

371
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,266
very, very important.

372
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,399
We're lucky to have
support from our top

373
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,133
leaders and our
Board of Directors.

374
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,466
At our company, we
actually meet with our

375
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:25,133
Board of Directors every
other month, so we are

376
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,433
constantly in
touch with them.

377
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,066
They are asking questions
of us and we are doing our

378
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:33,700
best to provide them
factual-based security

379
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,500
answers so they know
exactly what is going on

380
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,333
in our environment.

381
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,166
So, transparency is key.

382
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,000
>> PATRICK MORLEY: And
when I talk to CISOs about

383
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,299
how often they meet with
the Board, that is a quick

384
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,733
tell to me about how
strategic they view security.

385
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,766
If you're meeting every
other month, Southwest

386
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,665
takes it seriously.

387
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:54,199
Maybe just to wrap up, so
obviously RSA, a lot of

388
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,866
vendors here.

389
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,533
Again, as a leader
in security, as a

390
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,433
practitioner, what would
your ask be of us on the

391
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,966
vendor side in order to
make sure we're doing the

392
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,633
right things to
support the industry?

393
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,833
>> CARRIE MILLS: Yeah.

394
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,100
Probably our main ask
right now is just to help

395
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,866
us get past the
agent fatigue.

396
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,966
We have all these agents
that are running on all

397
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,333
of our boxes.

398
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,100
It is complex to manage.

399
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,833
When we talk about, you
know, IT security and OT

400
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,000
security, some of those
agents don't even work in

401
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,399
our OT environment.

402
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:29,566
How can we better build
in security at - when we

403
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:33,333
build up systems and when
we build these platforms?

404
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,366
And I'd also say, think
outside the box and be bold.

405
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:42,000
We - I know at least at
Southwest, we're open to

406
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,700
new ideas and new
ways of thinking.

407
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,733
We're always
looking forward.

408
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,266
We don't have to
always do what we have done

409
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,266
in it the past.

410
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,399
So, I think the bolt on
technologies to some

411
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,933
degree are holding us back
because we can't do more

412
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,399
strategic things
because we have to

413
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,566
maintain these products.

414
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,733
>> PATRICK MORLEY:
Well, great.

415
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,766
Well, thank you so much
for this morning and

416
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,966
thank you all.

417
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,766
I'll bring Sanjay back
out onto to the stage.

418
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,766
>> CARRIE MILLS:
Thank you, Patrick.

419
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,033
>> PATRICK MORLEY:
All right. Thank you.

420
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,900
>> SANJAY POONEN:
Thank you so much.

421
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,000
Thank you, Carrie.

422
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:12,733
>> CARRIE MILLS:
Thank you.

423
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,700
>> SANJAY POONEN:
Thank you, Patrick.

424
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,666
I appreciate it.
Wasn't that great?

425
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,933
Folks, just as I wrap up,
I would say that is kind

426
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,700
of the key thing if you
just look at the last

427
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:21,933
piece of what Carrie said.

428
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
It is incumbent in all of
us vendors to remove a lot

429
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:26,165
of that fatigue.

430
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,799
We believe the way in
which you remove that

431
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,933
fatigue is by
making something a

432
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,833
lot more intrinsic.

433
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,466
Please stop by VMWare.

434
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,899
We just acquired
Carbon Black.

435
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,632
So, we have not
coordinated on having but

436
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,400
we have double
the presence.

437
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:39,399
We have two
different booths.

438
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,399
You can go to either booth
and you will be able to

439
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:42,832
kind of get a little
bit of everything.

440
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,033
As I wrap up, listen,
from a standpoint, just a

441
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,033
thirty-second commercial,
what we are trying to get

442
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,933
done at VMWare, you
probably are hearing much

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,433
more about us in security.

444
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,733
We have a billion-dollar
security business and

445
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,533
over thirty thousand
customers and we're focused

446
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,666
in three areas.

447
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,200
Networking,
endpoint, and Cloud.

448
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,933
And collectively across
those, we're really trying

449
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,500
to do something with
platforms that are built in.

450
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:06,133
NSX is our platform on
the networking side.

451
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,166
Carbon Black and what
we're doing with Workspace

452
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,000
ONE and vSphere is built
into those capabilities.

453
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,299
So, it is no
longer siloed.

454
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,799
You know, in many
cases it is going to be

455
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,500
unified or agentless.

456
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,599
And a lot more focused,
especially in the area of

457
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,399
Cloud and something
that context centric.

458
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,866
And our job, and again,
we're going to be working

459
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,966
with plenty of you as to
ensure that as we build

460
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,000
these platforms, you get
the best without having to

461
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,033
stitch together lots and
lots and hundreds and

462
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,133
thousands of point tools.

463
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,066
Thank you very much and
have a great conference.

464
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,533
Goodbye.
