00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,339
- Lima, Peru.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,690
- Saudi Arabia.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,580
- Huston, Texas.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,630
- Westport, Connecticut.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,463
- Phoenix.

7
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:13,418
- Boston, Massachusets.

8
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:14,350
- From Dubai.

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,450
- Helsinki, Finland.

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,080
- University of Maryland at College Park.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,948
- Sweden.

12
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,532
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,370
- Curiosity.

14
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,140
I wanted to see what is it all about.

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,490
- New discoveries.

16
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,830
- We always meet new
people on social media,

17
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,019
but this is really the place
where everybody gets together.

18
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,901
- You can't walk across the show floor,

19
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,710
walk across the street to the W,

20
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,440
without bumping into an old friend,

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,809
so I love that part of it.

22
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,260
- This is a lot of learning experience

23
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,830
and this is like a lot
of experience to cherish

24
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,044
for a lifetime.

25
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,626
(upbeat music)

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,410
- This is the 29th RSA Conference, right?

27
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,870
This is for the conference
itself, and I have been to 28.

28
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,013
- I am here for the third time.

29
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,600
- The first time.

30
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,433
- First time.

31
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,660
- It's my first time.

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,459
- Oh, six or seven over the years.

33
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,660
- I'm actually quite new to
the field of cyber security,

34
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,300
so I'm trying to see
this as an opportunity

35
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,371
to learn the basics, kind
of the foundational stuff,

36
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,676
and help me get started in my career.

37
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:15,260
(upbeat music)

38
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,589
- We really need people, right?

39
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,060
We need their brain power and
more than computing power,

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,903
because you really can't
get anything done without

41
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,780
putting someone behind the keyboard,

42
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,005
or stepping up to find
new ideas and solutions.

43
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,588
(upbeat music)
