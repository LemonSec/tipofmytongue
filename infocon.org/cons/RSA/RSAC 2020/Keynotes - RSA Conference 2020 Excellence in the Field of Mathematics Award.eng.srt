00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,633
>> ANNOUNCER: And now to present
the Award for Excellence in the

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,366
Field of
Mathematics, Ron Rivest.

3
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,133
>> RON RIVEST:
Good morning everybody.

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,899
It is a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,266
Welcome old timers
and welcome newcomers.

6
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,632
It's my pleasure to present the
RSA 2020 Award for Excellence in

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,799
the Field of Mathematics.

8
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,600
This award is given to
outstanding pioneers in the

9
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:06,333
field whose contributions and
innovations are recognized for

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
their lasting value.

11
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,733
This year we have two winners.

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,466
They are true leaders in
symmetric key cryptographic

13
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:17,299
design who have advanced the
design and analysis of the field

14
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,233
and who have influenced
the current practice of

15
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,666
cryptography immensely.

16
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,500
This year's winners are
Professor Joan Daemen and

17
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,099
Professor Vincent Rijmen.

18
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:34,700
[Applause]

19
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,266
The award citation reads:

20
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,633
"For major contributions to
symmetric key cryptography,

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,200
including the development of the
advanced encryption standard

22
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,299
known as AES."

23
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,899
Let me say a few words more
about their contributions.

24
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,232
Professor Joan Daemen is a
Belgian cryptographer who

25
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,566
received his doctorate from
KU Leuven in the mid-90s.

26
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,966
He has designed many block
ciphers, including MMB, Square,

27
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,299
SHARK, NOEKEON,
3-Way and BaseKing.

28
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:05,633
In the late 90s, he co-designed
with Vincent Rijmen, the

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,265
Rijndael block cipher which
was selected by NIST as the US

30
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,433
Advanced Encryption
Standard, AES, in 2000.

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,433
That's twenty years ago.

32
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,300
This work involved design,
analysis and performance

33
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,400
evaluation.

34
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,699
It's well described in the
book they've written together.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,699
More recently, Joan co-designed
the Keccak cryptographic hash

36
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:29,500
based on the sponge design which
was selected as a new SHA-3 hash

37
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,266
in 2012.

38
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,566
Joan has had a long
career in industry.

39
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:38,500
In 2017, he won the Levchin
prize for contributions to

40
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:39,633
world cryptography.

41
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,000
He is now a Professor of
Symmetric Cryptography at the

42
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,533
Radboud University Nijmegen
in the Netherlands.

43
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,232
Unfortunately, Joan Daemen was
not able to make it to the

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,066
conference today.

45
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,433
This year's other winner,
Professor Vincent Rijmen, is

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,666
also a Belgian cryptographer
and a graduate of KU Leuven.

47
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,466
He is, obviously, the
co-designer of Rijndael cipher,

48
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,266
now the Advanced
Encryption Standard.

49
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,300
He is also the co-designer of
the WHIRLPOOL, the cryptographic

50
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:11,266
has function, and the block
ciphers Anubis, KHAZAD, Square,

51
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,566
NOEKEON and SHARK.

52
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,333
Vincent has had a career in both
industry and academia and is

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,733
currently a professor
in KU Leuven Belgium.

54
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,533
In 2019, he became a fellow at
the International Association

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,632
for Cryptologic Research for
his well-known contributions

56
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,666
to cryptography.

57
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,933
The Advanced Encryption Standard
or AES which is the joint design

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
of Professors Daemen and Rijmen
is now used everywhere for

59
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,466
data encryption.

60
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,732
It serves as an amazing example
of the power of mathematical

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,833
cryptography to influence
and secure our world.

62
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,833
For these contributions and many
more, we hereby award Professor

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,599
Joan Daemen and Professor
Vincent Rijmen the RSA 2020

64
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,433
Conference Award for Excellence
in the Field of Mathematics.

65
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,800
Please welcome Vincent Rijmen
who will accept the award for

66
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,533
both of them.

67
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,066
>> VINCENT RIJMEN: Ron, it is a
great honor for me to receive

68
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,566
this award through your hands.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,000
When I received the news that
I would get the 2020 award, I

70
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:45,332
looked up in Wikipedia the list
of previous winners, and to

71
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,566
paraphrase King Théoden of
Rohan, in this mighty company,

72
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,698
I feel a bit ashamed.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,466
It is true that I love the
straightforwardness and

74
00:04:55,533 --> 00:05:00,000
uncomplicatedness of
mathematics, a love that was

75
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,299
strengthened by several
excellent teachers that I had

76
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,800
the luck to meet.

77
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:07,666
But compared to their work, I
feel that my contributions to

78
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,133
mathematics are small.

79
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,600
Therefore, I would like
to dedicate this award to

80
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,233
mathematics teachers
all over the world.

81
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,433
(Applause)

82
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,066
I will proudly carry home this
Oscar of Mathematics and use it

83
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,332
to show students that doing
mathematics can be as rewarding

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,233
as being a movie actor.

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

86
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,832
>> RON RIVEST: Thank you.

87
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,399
Congratulations again.
