1
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,666
>> ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Chief Security

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,766
Officer, Akamai
Technologies, Andy Ellis.

3
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,233
>> ANDY ELLIS: Good
morning, folks, and

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,266
welcome back to another
lovely day here in

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,599
San Francisco.

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,500
First off, I'd like to
thank the RSA organizers

7
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,433
for providing closed
captioning for the keynotes.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,633
As someone who suddenly
became hard of hearing

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,466
last year, I personally
really appreciate the

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,100
inclusivity being shown
and I hope this makes it

11
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,500
more accessible
for more people.

12
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:46,266
Every year, a group of
security vendors gets up

13
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,899
here on stage and regales
you with stories of the

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,299
new and novel threats that
we all face and tells you

15
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,533
about the new buzzwords
and technologies that are

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
going to solve
these new problems.

17
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:00,299
I thought I'd take a
different tack and instead

18
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:03,533
look at how we
got here today.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
For those of you who
aren't as familiar with

20
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,366
Akamai, we're basically
the shopping mall

21
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,700
of the internet.

22
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,099
What do you buy from
a shopping mall?

23
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,899
It is a trick question.

24
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:14,565
Shoppers don't buy
anything from a shopping mall.

25
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,466
Stores do.

26
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,700
They buy access to the
infrastructure necessary

27
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,466
to bring their experience
closer to the edge where

28
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,500
their users are.

29
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,133
As the Chief Security
Officer, that basically

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
makes me the
internet's mall cop.

31
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,166
2020 is an opportune
time for us to use our

32
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,733
hindsight, and
conveniently for me, I've

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,633
always been at Akamai for
twenty years and gotten to

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,433
watch the evolution of the
internet from what I think

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,466
are the best seats
in the house.

36
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,133
And it strikes me that
the problems that we face

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,866
don't actually change that
much from decade to decade

38
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,299
as we rebrand the same
challenges, adopting new

39
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,666
technologies that expose
us to similar hazards that

40
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,733
we've already solved.

41
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,933
In our first decade,
Akamai was best known as a

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,166
content delivery network.

43
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,000
Some of our old
slides there.

44
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,099
That is an edge company
that made websites perform

45
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,400
better by caching and
delivering pages closer to

46
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,133
where the users are.

47
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,733
We had some performance
products and security

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,466
features and it was
those features that our

49
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,399
customers would sometimes
rely on to protect

50
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:27,800
themselves in the
early days of the web.

51
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:28,800
Why?

52
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:32,533
Because security embedded
into a business system has a

53
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,599
better chance of
success than security

54
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,666
tacked on separately.

55
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:41,133
Security comes in many
flavors and I personally

56
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,333
like the Information
Security Triad as a

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,900
reasonable model to
use to sort them.

58
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,266
One of the early security
controls that I helped

59
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,666
work on at Akamai was
object integrity.

60
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,000
Many image formats
used on the web have

61
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,400
a peculiar feature.

62
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,533
If you begin reading part
of one file and then start

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,399
reading the end of another
file, your browser will

64
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,733
render that as
one hybrid image.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,300
That's a challenge for a
content delivery network,

66
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,766
especially if those
images were from

67
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,233
two different customers.

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Even as rare as file
pointer errors are, when

69
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,900
you are delivering
millions of objects every

70
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,300
second, a one in a billion
error is going to happen

71
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:25,400
dozens of times a day.

72
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,733
So, we added a system to
embed water marks inside

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,733
each file so that we could
continuously check that we

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,066
were still reading the
same file that we'd started.

75
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,233
A few years later with the
dawn of the encrypted web,

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,533
a similar challenge arose.

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,333
How did we really know
that the origin website we

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,533
were talking to was the
one that we intended to?

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,166
Again, we needed to design
a working control system

80
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,500
to ensure that we could
validate the origin site

81
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,000
in the same way that we
had validated the object

82
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:02,266
we were reading before
connecting an end user to it.

83
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,699
We had to design and build
a site integrity system to

84
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,965
detect when network errors
might create this problem,

85
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:15,833
leading to content going
to the worst or wrong places.

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,300
And today we've seen the
rise of another integrity

87
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,099
challenge as more and more
websites are assembled

88
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,199
dynamically in the browser
from origins that are

89
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,600
controlled by a number
of different entities.

90
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:35,133
This HTML supply chain for
our banking, our news, and

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,600
our entertainment sites
exposes us because it

92
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,600
includes JavaScript
sourced from third party

93
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,966
libraries and
advertising networks.

94
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,899
How do we all make sure
that our browsers aren't

95
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:51,000
running code injected
by an adversary?

96
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,832
Sitting in the middle of
the user and app ecosystem

97
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:58,133
as I do lets me understand
and see how apps work, how

98
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,500
users engage with them,
combining that with the

99
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:05,265
threat intelligence from
attacks we've seen, and it

100
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,000
lets us identify this
new threat vector, form

101
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,899
jacking, of the sort
that the Magecart group

102
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,433
exploits on a
regular basis.

103
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,100
Today, the average
site is composed of 35%

104
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,300
third-party content.

105
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,133
Much of that content is
scripts, of which the most

106
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,133
common form is JavaScript.

107
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,433
The Magecart group has
been creating a new

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,800
reality by exploiting a
lack of security controls

109
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,832
in the browser, either
corrupting the supply

110
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,399
chain for the company
publishing the site or

111
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,333
corrupting the ecosystem
provider that publishes

112
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,866
content that then gets
included into the site.

113
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:49,566
The result is experienced
by businesses who have

114
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:53,799
seen massive GDPR fines,
not for directly leaking

115
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:57,332
user identity but for
failing to ensure page

116
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,699
integrity where the content ended up being exposed.

117
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:04,800
Web page integrity is the
next challenge to solve in

118
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,866
the integrity domain.

119
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,399
While we were building
these integrated integrity

120
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,699
features on the back end,
if you will, hazards on

121
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,266
the front end bring
different challenges.

122
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,533
Availability is often
overlooked as part of the

123
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,133
information security domain,
but nothing has presented a

124
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,066
greater threat to it than
DDoS and flash crowds.

125
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,198
The first DDoS
attacks we ever saw were

126
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,866
primarily self-inflicted.

127
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,399
A viral marketing campaign
for Victoria Secret or

128
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:40,100
BET, a Super Bowl ad that
the marketing and IT team

129
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,033
hadn't really planned for
its success might lead to

130
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,366
a flash crowd that would
take down a website.

131
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,233
Maybe a virus with an
attack payload like code

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,100
red when it targeted the
White House would lead to

133
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,366
a conversation about using
offload capabilities as a

134
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,332
security measure.

135
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:00,266
But there wasn't really a
full-fledged market for

136
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,899
DDoS attacks and defense
in the early 2000s.

137
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,433
But flash crowd management
made site availability a

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,366
real challenge for
all of us to address.

139
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,133
In those early days, I
recall an anti-virus

140
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,500
vendor whose anti-virus
updates created a problem

141
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:21,899
because downloads took
over an hour for each user.

142
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,199
And since updates would
download at the same time,

143
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:29,233
local time every day,
computers in the next time

144
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,000
zone would hit that
time, they would begin

145
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,133
downloading and their
servers would be crushed

146
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,600
all day long.

147
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,766
Basically, they had
implemented their own

148
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,399
predictable DDoS attack on
themselves unfortunately.

149
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,666
But the traffic only took
an hour because they

150
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,666
couldn't handle
that attack.

151
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,100
When they moved that
delivery out to the edge,

152
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,466
that flash crowd just
becomes hourly spikes.

153
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,099
But complex marketing
campaigns like when

154
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,933
Logitech wanted to
give away keyboards to

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,600
everybody in America, or
at least some subset of

156
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,233
them, but wanted
to ensure they were

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,733
well-distributed, would
drive edge computing needs

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,933
as lotteries would need to
run closer to the edge,

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,199
protecting infrastructure
from massive traffic spikes.

160
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:18,000
Site availability
requirements would drive

161
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,166
computational features
that users needed from

162
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,300
those lotteries to imagery
sizing and management, to

163
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:27,966
video archiving and
playback, and a whole host

164
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:30,933
of other capabilities
at the edge.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,832
But that absence of a
primary market for DDoS

166
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,265
defense, that would change
with Operation Payback and

167
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,332
the rise of Anonymous.

168
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,232
DDoS had spent several
years mostly as

169
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,100
internecine warfare
amongst businesses who

170
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,733
operated in legal gray
areas like offshore

171
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,000
gambling and organizations
who might attack their

172
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,500
rivals on extortionists
who would try to shut down

173
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,799
smaller enterprises.

174
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:01,000
The first generations
of DDoS attacks really

175
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:04,466
focused on front end
resources like your ISP's

176
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:07,399
network capacity,
sometimes consuming them

177
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,299
with a lot of traffic,
sometimes targeting

178
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,433
carefully chosen
resources, like Slowloris

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,566
attempting to use the
fewest possible packets to

180
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,566
keep open all available
web server connections.

181
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,200
But the rise of Anonymous
coincided with the

182
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,565
democratization
of attack tools.

183
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,566
Low orbit ion canon, or
LOIC, was the most popular

184
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:35,933
for straight DDoS attacks,
but we started to see a shift.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,866
More and more adversaries
were targeting the web

186
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,866
applications themselves,
either to gain access to a

187
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:45,566
server, potentially to
conduct a defacement, or

188
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,799
to attack a more
valuable resource.

189
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,066
As we learned how to
defend against each of

190
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,700
these, we realized that
we had shifted from site

191
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,333
availability to
application availability

192
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,399
and that required not just
capacity at the edge, but

193
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,399
bringing compute to bear
on that problem as we

194
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,966
implemented not only web
application firewalls and

195
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,200
application performance
management, but context

196
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,699
aware rate limiting to
bear on this challenge.

197
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,766
When we first entered that
last market, what we had

198
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,500
heard from everyone
and, frankly, believed

199
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:25,266
ourselves, was that rules
had to be tailored by hand

200
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,299
for every application
because web application

201
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,233
firewalls were finicky
devices and that

202
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,632
integrations were
therefore long and

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,166
expensive and
time consuming.

204
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
To all of those early
customers for WAFs, ours

205
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,966
or someone else's, I'd
like to apologize on

206
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,833
behalf of the industry.

207
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,866
We were wrong.

208
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,700
You see, many of the early
WAFs had started with

209
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,065
carefully tailored
rule sets.

210
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,833
But over time, as they had
grown through community

211
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,666
involvement, many of the
rule sets weren't tested

212
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,733
in a diversity
of environments.

213
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:04,733
So, this rule, intended to
catch Little Bobby Tables,

214
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,665
worked lovely unless of
course your user was

215
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,599
searching for that
drop-leaf table that you

216
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,133
were selling.

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,266
WAFs were too literal
without optimized rule

218
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,699
sets, optimizing
that rule set.

219
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,899
But more importantly,
shifting to a model where

220
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,000
multiple indicators
could be looked for

221
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:28,200
independently would take
the WAF market forward,

222
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,699
taking it from being a
hindrance to the industry,

223
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:33,833
with WAFs sometimes stuck
on a shelf, to being a

224
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,100
transparent and effective
security control that

225
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,166
everyone is
expected to use.

226
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,700
But adversaries have
continued to adapt and evolve.

227
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,799
And while we still see
DDoS attacks, just at

228
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:51,033
larger sizes, we're now
seeing attacks in excess

229
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,966
of one terabit per second.

230
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,299
The way in which one of
the most modern attacks is

231
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:59,500
conducted, credential
stuffing, mirrors those

232
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:02,333
earlier original
DDoS attacks.

233
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,833
An adversary has a
collection of usernames

234
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,066
and passwords and they
would like to test on your

235
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,100
site which ones will work.

236
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,399
Once they've succeeded at
account takeover, they can

237
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,633
then complete the next
stage of their attack

238
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,133
which frankly might just
be to sell that higher

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,700
quality data because like
ten years ago, tools were

240
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:26,132
being shared; now
the work is too.

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The gig economy has come
to the DDoS and fraud

242
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:32,199
spaces, with professional
bot herders who will

243
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:36,466
assemble and operate a bot
network and rent it to

244
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,799
someone who will only
conduct their attack for a

245
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:42,500
few hours or maybe
a day or two.

246
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,100
Those attacks might just
be in service of selling

247
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,233
more information, that
breached personal data or

248
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,100
information about accounts
that work in a given space

249
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,333
or at a given site, with
the additional benefit of

250
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,533
separating information
across attackers, making

251
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,500
defense correlation
much harder.

252
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,799
We've even seen
adversaries starting to

253
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,799
use defender information
sharing platforms for

254
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,699
reconnaissance.

255
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:11,299
Each attack they'll send
unique attack signatures

256
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,699
to a site and wait to see
which ones pop up on those

257
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,199
information sharing
platforms, letting them

258
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,766
know which sites
are being monitored.

259
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,433
This new world of account
availability will continue

260
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,033
to evolve and present
major challenges as we all

261
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,299
seek to better engage
in bot management.

262
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,899
Of course, we can't have
discussed two legs of the

263
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:38,166
InfoSec Triad without
talking about the third,

264
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,199
confidentiality.

265
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:44,399
In the early days of the
web, no one really used

266
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:47,933
TLS or really, we should
call it SSL because that

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,433
was its name then, but
since it's changed its

268
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,399
name, we'll go with TLS.

269
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,266
We realized that
to support the

270
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,266
confidentiality needs
at the edge, we need to

271
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,466
design and build
for object and site

272
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:04,600
confidentiality, a
TLS CDN, if you will.

273
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,333
This entailed building a
distributed lights out key

274
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,600
management system and
growing trust in the idea

275
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,333
of conducting sensitive
transactions across the

276
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,633
internet which you might
all recall we had all

277
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,233
believed had already
reached its pinnacle of

278
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:25,899
achievement in the distribution of kitten pictures.

279
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,066
For many of the customers
of ours who had moved to

280
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,299
TLS in that first decade,
we had transformed from

281
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:35,399
merely an edge delivery
company into a performance

282
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:38,899
or edge compute company
with both offload and

283
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:43,899
security products and
that's when Aurora hit.

284
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,833
I got up here two years
ago to tell you about Aurora.

285
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,533
RSA hopefully has
that video online.

286
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,733
But a short takeaway is
that passwords suck and

287
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,966
the lateral
movement also sucks.

288
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,233
With other security
products starting to gain

289
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,399
traction for us, a breach
of this type couldn't be

290
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,299
allowed to repeat itself.

291
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,899
So, as we had in
redesigning our content

292
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,600
delivery network a
decade before, we began

293
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,066
transforming our
enterprise network.

294
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,233
That Zero Trust
transformation has taken

295
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,433
Akamai most of a decade,
much because we were

296
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,633
breaking new ground
alongside other companies

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,633
like Google with its
BeyondCorp initiative.

298
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,233
The challenge that we
all faced was enterprise

299
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,632
confidentiality and it
was this belief that

300
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,133
architectures were rooted
in a single, secure

301
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,399
enterprise land.

302
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:39,700
It probably never really
was all that secure, but

303
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:44,099
most importantly
originally it was disconnected.

304
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,566
And as our networks began
to be more and more

305
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,299
interconnected, the
hazards to enterprise

306
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:54,366
confidentiality outpaced
our architectures.

307
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:57,833
I'll be honest; our first
attempt at redesign was

308
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,399
ineffective.

309
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:02,133
I tried to lead us down
the then best practice of

310
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,666
network micro
segmentation, but in a

311
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,699
modern enterprise, that
presents an administration

312
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,033
and logistical nightmare
for implementation.

313
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,333
The obvious place to start
is by isolating your

314
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,633
servers from
lateral movement.

315
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,700
But so many servers today
are parts of an integrated

316
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:22,132
ecosystem, from back up
servers to configuration

317
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,133
management to
vulnerability scanning,

318
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,166
time is short.

319
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,433
If you'd like the whole
list, go walk the show floor.

320
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,633
The real problem wasn't in
which computers could talk

321
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,733
to which computers,
but really in which

322
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,966
applications could talk
to which applications.

323
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,033
And rather than trying to
isolate piece by piece

324
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,399
could we instead isolate
the most unpredictable

325
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,299
part of the
enterprise, the users?

326
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:54,266
Now, this isn't a blame
the users tirade.

327
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,799
Users are unpredictable
because they provide

328
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,233
business values in ways we
can't predict in advance.

329
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,366
And they'll do things
we couldn't anticipate.

330
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:06,333
And, at the same time, we
provide them with tools

331
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,066
that are fundamentally
dangerous to them.

332
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,500
The two biggest hazards in
the enterprise are the web

333
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,098
browser and the email
client, both of which are

334
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:21,066
basically designed to let
you or the adversary hide

335
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,233
important safety
information from a user.

336
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,098
And it doesn't help that
we demand our users click

337
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:30,666
on sketchy looking links
to get paid or to engage

338
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,332
in HR training right
before we then tell them

339
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,833
to stop clicking on
sketchy looking links.

340
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:41,366
So, we wondered if we
could ensure enterprise

341
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,633
confidentiality by
isolating our users, not

342
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,233
from the internet but from
the enterprise itself.

343
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,966
We redesigned our
enterprise connectivity to

344
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:54,399
put our entire edge
network between our users

345
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,832
and our corporate systems,
giving users a predictable

346
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,566
and consistent interface,
security controls enforced

347
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,599
at the edge, cryptographic
protocol selection,

348
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,399
authentication styles,
as well as application

349
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:11,500
security controls for our
internal applications.

350
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:15,166
Along the way on that
redesign, which paralleled

351
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,666
some of those early Zero
Trust initiatives, we

352
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:21,133
relearned an important
truth about good design.

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
That this arrow, trading
off performance against

354
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,700
security, is wrong.

355
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,299
In a well-designed system
you can end up with both.

356
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,299
Which brings us to
the next challenge in

357
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:36,266
confidentiality, identity
confidentiality.

358
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:40,033
As regulations like
GDPR and CCPA indicate,

359
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:43,566
protecting identities, not
merely from breaches but

360
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,766
also from internal and
corporate misuse, is an

361
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,433
area that companies
with far flung user bases

362
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,299
need to address.

363
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:55,299
James Pavur presented at
Black Hat this past summer

364
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:59,066
about how GDPR compliance
activities can create

365
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,400
a new risk.

366
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:05,466
By sending demand letters
on behalf of his fiancée

367
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,565
with her knowledge but
without any form of

368
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:12,133
explicit transmittable
consent to 150 companies,

369
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,166
he was able to extract her
personal information from

370
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,299
dozens of them.

371
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,066
Complying with these
regulations while keeping

372
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:23,033
this data safe is going
to be a new hazard in

373
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,866
confidentiality for
businesses to address.

374
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,900
While I haven't even
touched on many of the

375
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:32,533
other environmental
challenges that will take

376
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,133
existing hazards and give
us new challenges, like

377
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,099
IoT with its challenge
of unpatchable embedded

378
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,533
systems, or 5G which might
someday give us ubiquitous

379
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,700
internet to connect all of
those IoT systems with,

380
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,599
let's all recognize
that addressing those

381
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:56,166
challenges will, at least,
keep folks in our industry

382
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,633
gainfully employed for
the foreseeable future.

383
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,366
So, I'd like to thank you
all for coming out this

384
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:07,033
morning and may you all
have safe travels back to

385
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:11,466
your homes or onwards to
your next destination.

386
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,599
Thank you.
