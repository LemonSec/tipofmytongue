1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
we have emily hacker and she is going to

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,160
tell us about avoiding

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,480
murky waters uh clear threat

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
intelligence communications

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,480
and watercolor painting so i'm very

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
excited for both those topics

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,759
thank you for joining us today emily i

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
really appreciate you being here

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,920
thanks leslie my name is emily hacker

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,279
and today i'm going to talk to you about

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,520
how to avoid murky waters

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,039
both in threat intelligence

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
communications and in watercolor

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
painting

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
so to start let me tell you a little bit

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
about myself um

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
as i said my name is emily hacker and uh

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
yeah that is my real name

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,719
i'm a threat intelligence analyst at

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
microsoft and i've been in the industry

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,079
for about six years

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
i started out as a technical writer on

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
an intelligence team

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
and i did that for about a year and a

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
half before i formally transitioned into

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
threat intelligence analysis

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
so i have the perspective both from an

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,840
analysis background and a communications

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,199
background prior to microsoft i worked

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,680
um

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
for a security vendor as a security

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,120
researcher and before that

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,959
i worked as an intelligence analyst for

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
an oil and gas company

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
which is the same place where i got my

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
start as a tech writer

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
if anyone has any questions for me later

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,159
um you can find me on twitter as

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
at dreadphones

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
for my security focus topic today i want

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,479
to talk

42
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,320
about how to produce clear threat

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
intelligence communications

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
communication is a vital aspect of

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,159
intelligence

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,479
in fact intelligence cannot exist

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,960
without communication

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,640
but in the cyber threat intelligence

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
industry i have

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
found a lot of resources for people to

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
learn about the technical aspects of the

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,880
job

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,640
and the majority of people that i have

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
worked with have a technical background

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,240
but i've noticed there's far fewer

56
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
resources for people that have that tech

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
aspect of the job down

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,799
but want to learn more about the

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,600
communications aspect

60
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,399
some people refer to communication as a

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,600
soft skill

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
but i want to challenge that notion i'm

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,040
not really sure what the opposite of a

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,079
soft skill is

65
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,360
but i think we can all agree that

66
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
writing and communicating can be really

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
hard

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
um how many of us have ever opened up a

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,959
word document to write a report about

70
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,640
the latest malware strain that's

71
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
affecting our industry

72
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
only to kind of just stare at it blankly

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
not even sure where to start

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
or how many of us have ever read a blog

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
posted online about a new threat

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
only to finish it with more questions

77
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,640
than we started with

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,319
clearly communicating intelligence to

79
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
key stakeholders is important and it

80
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
shouldn't be written off as a soft skill

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
to start off let's define the difference

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
between a news report and an

83
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,040
intelligence report

84
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
and just to clarify i'm not knocking

85
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
news reports i actually have a degree in

86
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,760
journalism and i started my adult life

87
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
working at a small city newspaper

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
there is a hugely important role that

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
the news plays in our industry

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
but it's a different role than that of

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
intelligence

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
so what role does the news play

93
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
um to put it simply the role of news is

94
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,480
to inform

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
a lot of times this is done in a

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,560
somewhat purposefully generic way

97
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
um as the audience of a news report will

98
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
vary hugely in background

99
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
industry skill level interest level

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
some news reports can include some

101
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
generic mitigations uh for example a

102
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
news report about

103
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
patch tuesday might include the generic

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,519
recommendation of

105
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
patch but for the most part a news

106
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,799
article you will read

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,560
is just gonna let you know what is going

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
on

109
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,159
an intelligence report should take this

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,200
a step further an intelligence report is

111
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
still informing the audience about the

112
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,519
thing that's happening

113
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
but what sets an intelligence report

114
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
apart from a news report

115
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
is that it helps decision makers make

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
decisions and that's what intelligence

117
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,959
boils down to

118
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
to do this an intelligence report needs

119
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
to contain

120
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,480
actionable information and while we're

121
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
on the topic i will bring up a phrase

122
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
that many of us have likely heard which

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,080
is

124
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
actionable intelligence i bring this up

125
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
because i don't

126
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
want to hear this phrase again if

127
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
intelligence isn't actionable it is just

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,519
information

129
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
not intelligent secondly

130
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,879
intelligence reports need to include

131
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,080
tailored information

132
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
mitigations and next steps this is

133
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,439
critical for the

134
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
help decision makers make decision

135
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,238
aspects of intelligence

136
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,560
i can already predict some people maybe

137
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
maybe pushing back on the statement so

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
i'm going to pre-clarify

139
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
by tailored i don't necessarily mean

140
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
written for one specific company or one

141
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,600
specific recipient

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
i don't mean that every intelligence

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
vendor should write a different report

144
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
for each of their clients with

145
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,680
information about how

146
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
trick bot or whatever has affected them

147
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
what i do mean is that a report should

148
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
be as specific as is required for the

149
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
audience

150
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
if you're an embedded intelligence

151
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
analyst working with a sock

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,759
this likely does mean that you need to

153
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
tailor your report

154
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
um to just your company don't write

155
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
about emote

156
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
in general write about whether it's

157
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,919
affected your industry

158
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
or write about an incident that you saw

159
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
in your own telemetry

160
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
this also means that you need to include

161
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
tailored recommendations to help make

162
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
decisions

163
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
are there specific security controls

164
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
that your organization should enforce

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
to help stop this threat from affecting

166
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
you should incident responders put in

167
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,759
blocks for specific indicators that

168
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
you're seeing

169
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
if you are a vendor this probably does

170
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,600
look a little bit different but it

171
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,039
doesn't mean you aren't still writing

172
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:23,759
tailored

173
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
intelligence part of what sets a vendor

174
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
like crowdstrike or microsoft or

175
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
proofpoint or any of the myriad other

176
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
intelligence providers apart from a

177
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
security news blog

178
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
is our ability to tailor our reports

179
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
with internal data and telemetry

180
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,600
we can write specifically about how

181
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
we've seen threats used

182
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
what we've seen them lead to what the

183
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
consequences have been for other

184
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
companies and importantly what our own

185
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
customers should do to avoid the same

186
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
fate

187
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
whether you're an embedded analyst or a

188
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,759
vendor

189
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
after your intended audience reads your

190
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
report they should walk away

191
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
understanding both the threat to their

192
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
organization and what actions they need

193
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,359
to take

194
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,360
in order to make sure um that people

195
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
understand your report there's an easy

196
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,720
formula of questions that you should be

197
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
answering

198
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
what is the threat what is the potential

199
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
impact and what do they need to do about

200
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,039
it

201
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,400
for the first question you're answering

202
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
what is the threat and to do this you're

203
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
describing what is happening or you're

204
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,919
informing the user and this

205
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
aspect of your report is actually very

206
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
similar to a news report in a lot of

207
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:27,600
ways

208
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
which is why reading the news is

209
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
actually so helpful for intelligence

210
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
analysis

211
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,120
when you're describing the threat make

212
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
sure that you don't just

213
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
mention a malware family name for

214
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
example because malware by itself

215
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
isn't a threat because it doesn't have

216
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,199
you know intent or

217
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680
opportunity really an example of an

218
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
answer to this question

219
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
could be something along the lines of

220
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
our organization has recently seen a

221
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
surge in incidents related to trickbot

222
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
trickbot was originally defined as a

223
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
banking trojan but has evolved over time

224
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,599
to become

225
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,440
a prolific modular malware that can be

226
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
modified to suit the attacker's specific

227
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
needs it is frequently delivered via

228
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
malicious emails or is dropped by other

229
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
malware variants especially emote that

230
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
was a pretty vague

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
answer to that question but depending on

232
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
the length of the report i might add

233
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
more for the audience but you get the

234
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
idea of how you would describe the

235
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
threat

236
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
the next question to answer is what is

237
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
the potential impact from this threat

238
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
and this can be a mix both of things

239
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
that you have seen in your own internal

240
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
telemetry

241
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
and stuff that's been reported from

242
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
other organizations

243
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
for example for trickbot using that

244
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
example again you may not have seen it

245
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,840
leading to

246
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
ryuk in your own organization but that's

247
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,919
still a potential impact so it would be

248
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
worth mentioning in your report

249
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
however if you have seen trickbot in

250
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,800
your own organization

251
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
leading to cobalt strike or hands-on

252
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,280
keyboard activity and data exfiltration

253
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
you would want to include that as well

254
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
and make it clear that that's already

255
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
impacting you

256
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
for example you could say while trickbot

257
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
can be used in a variety of ways

258
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
we have seen attackers leveraging their

259
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,080
foothold from trickbot in our

260
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
organization

261
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
to deploy cobalt strike beacons and

262
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,479
perform reconnaissance and it's likely

263
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,720
they will attempt exultation of data

264
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,479
in addition trickbot has been widely

265
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,840
reported to lead to ransomware

266
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
especially rio

267
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,759
the final question to answer in your

268
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,639
report

269
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
is what should the audience do about the

270
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
threat and the answer to the question

271
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
will vary depending on who the audience

272
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
of your report is

273
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
which i'll talk about in my next slide

274
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
but in general it's important for your

275
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
audience to walk away from the report

276
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
knowing what steps they need to take do

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,599
they need to block certain iocs

278
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,839
patch of vulnerability hunt in their own

279
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,200
environment for a certain type of

280
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
malware or certain threat

281
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
make large organizational changes such

282
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
as group policies to disallow

283
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,200
entire threat vectors even though the

284
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,760
length

285
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
and audience of a report may vary widely

286
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,000
answering at minimum these three

287
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,360
questions will help your audience

288
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
understand your intelligence report

289
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
a lot more than them trying to glean

290
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
those answers as they're

291
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
reading it buried amongst all the other

292
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
data in your report

293
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
in fact for longer reports i recommend

294
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
having an introductory section

295
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,040
or a summary section at the beginning

296
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
that answers these three questions

297
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,959
before you move on to a larger technical

298
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,319
analysis or more details

299
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
so this brings me to my next point which

300
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
is audience

301
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
if i am a vaccine scientist writing a

302
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
scholarly peer-reviewed

303
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
research article about my latest

304
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
findings i'm going to write

305
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
those findings a lot differently than if

306
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,839
i'm writing them for an article in the

307
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,120
new york times

308
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
the same logical is true for

309
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
intelligence communications different

310
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,040
audiences

311
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
need different types of information

312
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
amounts of data and levels of detail

313
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
let's say you're an embedded analyst who

314
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,680
has just heard about a new malware

315
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
threat to your industry

316
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
a report to your incident response team

317
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
may just include a brief summary of the

318
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,560
threat

319
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,800
and a list of iocs to block maybe

320
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
depending on how quickly they need to

321
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
react

322
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
a report to your ciso regarding the same

323
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
threat is likely going to look

324
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
a lot different than that a list of

325
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
hashes probably isn't

326
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
really helpful or interesting to them

327
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,959
what they want to understand

328
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
is the impact to the organization and

329
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
what next steps need to be taken by

330
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
the larger security organization

331
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
if you're a vendor you are probably

332
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
often writing reports that will go to a

333
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
wide variety of audiences

334
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
it might include other intelligence

335
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
analysts management threat hunters

336
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,880
incident responders

337
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,959
and you can't write a different report

338
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,560
for each one of these recipients

339
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,720
what you can do however is have

340
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
different reports sections

341
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
start each report with an executive

342
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
summary that is enough information for

343
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,640
management

344
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
which means you'll want to include some

345
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
recommendations in your

346
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,320
executive summary and then you can

347
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
include longer technical

348
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,480
analysis after that for recipients who

349
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
are maybe also

350
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
you know other intelligence analysts or

351
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
threat hunters and then

352
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
specific iocs or specific hunting

353
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
queries can be included

354
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
in a technical appendix for only the

355
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
audiences

356
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
that actually really need those for

357
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
their job

358
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,160
by organizing your report this way your

359
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
recipients can read only the sections

360
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,279
that pertain to them

361
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
without shuffling through your entire

362
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
report looking desperately for the part

363
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,160
that they actually care about

364
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,519
and last but definitely not least about

365
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,320
audience

366
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
i want to touch on responding to rfis

367
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,399
which are requests for intelligence

368
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,959
and getting feedback on your reports

369
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
since the purpose of intelligence is

370
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
communicating it to other teams

371
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
it's critically important that those

372
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
teams understand

373
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,399
and find value in your reports make sure

374
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
to develop relationships with the

375
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
audiences of your report

376
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
ask them to provide feedback for how

377
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,240
they'd like to see changes going forward

378
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
set up rfi processes with key

379
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,440
stakeholders

380
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
so you can ensure that you're going to

381
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
be writing about the subjects that they

382
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
actually need to learn about

383
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,000
intelligence is only valuable if your

384
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,519
audience understands it

385
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
so make sure that they do

386
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,240
so far i've talked a lot about reports

387
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
but i want to take a moment to define

388
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
all of the different ways that

389
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
intelligence reports

390
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
can take form any time that you're

391
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
communicating information about a threat

392
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
its impact and what how it can be dealt

393
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
with i'd argue that you're sharing

394
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,079
intelligence

395
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,240
in written form we do most commonly

396
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
think of this as an intelligence report

397
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
we probably have these get sent to us

398
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
from vendors or we see them posted

399
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,240
online

400
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
we might have to write these ourselves

401
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
and they take a lot of time and a lot of

402
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,639
research and they

403
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,160
probably involve several layers of

404
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
editing hence how i got my start in the

405
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
industry

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
but that's not the only form of written

407
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
intelligence how many of us have ever

408
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
pivoted on something in our

409
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,079
own environment that we found on twitter

410
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
i certainly use twitter for intelligence

411
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
i often will see tweets that are along

412
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,519
the lines of

413
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
hey i'm seeing a phishing campaign using

414
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
teams lures to get users to click on a

415
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,639
credential phishing link

416
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,040
the senders are using gmail accounts and

417
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
the subject lines all contain

418
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
new message for you and it'll probably

419
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
contain a screenshot of the email a lot

420
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,040
of times

421
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
and there you go that's intelligence

422
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,240
what's the threat

423
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
a fake team's phishing campaign what's

424
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
the potential impact loss of credentials

425
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
what are the next steps to take search

426
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
your environment for emails that match

427
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,320
those

428
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
details another type of written

429
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
intelligence of prop

430
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
um a lot of us probably do but don't

431
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
really think about as much

432
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
are incident write-ups anytime you're

433
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
documenting your investigation for an

434
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,959
incident

435
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,760
you're documenting intelligence keep

436
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,279
that in mind when you're doing write-ups

437
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,800
and consider how helpful you're being

438
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,120
for

439
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
yourself the next time you face the same

440
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
threat i have certainly been guilty of

441
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,240
feeling

442
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,279
rushed and writing my incident right ups

443
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,800
really fast thinking that nobody's ever

444
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,399
gonna see that nobody really cares but

445
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:44,959
me

446
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,120
and then two months later the similar

447
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
threat impacts my organization again and

448
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,399
i come back to thinking

449
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
wait a minute like how did i deal with

450
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
this last time how did i find all the

451
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
affected machines what did we do about

452
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,839
this

453
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
writing that information down the first

454
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
time will help your team and your own

455
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
future sanity intelligence

456
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
doesn't have to be written down though

457
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,959
in order to be

458
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
intelligence verbal intelligence is just

459
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,639
as important

460
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,079
and this could take the form of maybe a

461
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,000
vendor call to a customer letting them

462
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
know about a threat

463
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
that's impacting their industry this

464
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
could be kind of in the same way as a

465
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
report but

466
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
in verbal form or maybe it's a call with

467
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
other industry analysts

468
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
if you're on a call with those analysts

469
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
and you hear someone say

470
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
we've been seeing a lot of ice id lately

471
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,000
that's not

472
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
really all that helpful but if you hear

473
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,839
them say we've been seeing a lot of ice

474
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
id coming in through email leading to

475
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
hands-on keyboard beta exfiltration it's

476
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
a lot more helpful especially when they

477
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
follow it up with indicators

478
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,639
or ttps or something that you can

479
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
actually pivot on

480
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
even the dreaded management presentation

481
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
is an important form of intelligence

482
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
in one of my previous roles we had to

483
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
give a monthly intelligence presentation

484
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
to upper management

485
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
and while i dreaded it because it was

486
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
nerve-wracking it was admittedly

487
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
one of the most impactful methods we had

488
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
to enact change

489
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
these presentations didn't just include

490
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
information on what we were seeing

491
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
but recommendations on what actions

492
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,600
management should be taking to protect

493
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,399
the company

494
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,079
combined with data from multiple

495
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,600
incidents and how the change would

496
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
impact the organization

497
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,399
management was able to walk away

498
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,760
equipped to make a decision and

499
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
sometimes those decisions would cut off

500
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
entire entry vectors that had been

501
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
plaguing us for months

502
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
stuff like that really highlights the

503
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
value of intelligence

504
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,240
if you can tell your audience what the

505
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
threat is how it impacts your org

506
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,839
and what they should be doing about it

507
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,839
you can help defend against malicious

508
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
activity

509
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
so we just talked a lot about a bunch of

510
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
different forms of reports and you may

511
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,440
have

512
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,399
noticed that they would have varied a

513
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,240
lot and what kind of content you would

514
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,040
include in those

515
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,959
different forms of communication and

516
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
that makes sense because intelligence

517
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
isn't a one-size-fits-all

518
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,880
approach different intelligence teams do

519
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
different types of work

520
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
and therefore produce different reports

521
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,600
i've heard

522
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
different terms for these three types of

523
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,199
intelligence um and people might think

524
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,079
of these differently

525
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,959
but these are the ones that have

526
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
resonated with me that i've seen

527
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
reflected in my daily jobs

528
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
but it's the concept behind the terms

529
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,040
that are important so i'll talk about

530
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,399
them

531
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,920
the first type of intelligence report

532
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,759
that i want to talk about is one that

533
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,399
is a tactical report these reports are

534
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
oftentimes going to be related to an

535
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
ongoing incident or an investigation and

536
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
might be sent to your sock or your ir

537
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,880
team

538
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
to help them in their remediation

539
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
efforts

540
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
a lot of times these reports are going

541
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
to need to be sent out

542
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,199
pretty quickly so you aren't going to

543
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
have the luxury of spending weeks

544
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
doing research looking at evidence

545
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
crafting your message going through

546
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
editing

547
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
um they're usually just going to take

548
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,560
the form of a few sentences that answer

549
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,120
your three

550
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
critical questions what is the threat

551
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,639
what is the impact what do they need to

552
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,600
do about it

553
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
and then that's kind of it there might

554
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
include a list of iocs or something as

555
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
well

556
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,079
if you're an embedded analyst you might

557
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,600
find yourself needing to send out this

558
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,399
type of

559
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
report a lot so it's probably helpful to

560
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
have a quick report template

561
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
that just basically outlines those three

562
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,919
questions for you to answer

563
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,120
and get sent off as is

564
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
the next type of report is an

565
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,319
operational report

566
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,919
this is kind of actually where i live

567
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,359
currently in my current job so i can

568
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,799
talk about this one a lot

569
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,959
um and it's kind of the bridge between

570
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
tactical and strategic so

571
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
it's more than like a one-off incident

572
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,480
but you're not necessarily detailing an

573
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
entire actor's

574
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
activities this may look like a report

575
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
about how a specific malware variant was

576
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,360
observed during a few months period of

577
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
time

578
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,200
it prob it it probably will be

579
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
including a lot of information from

580
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
multiple incidents so not just one

581
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
and it would include the various

582
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
infection vectors and kill chain

583
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
from those incidents but it's not going

584
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,520
to go into detail

585
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
about every way that malware has been

586
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,799
used over the course of history

587
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,120
or necessarily who the operator of that

588
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
malware is

589
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
what is still important though are those

590
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,240
three questions that

591
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
i've talked about a little bit too much

592
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
probably now um those questions can

593
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,039
still be answered

594
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
but this report will probably be more

595
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
detailed in a tactical report and

596
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
include more research

597
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
and it'll probably take a little bit

598
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,559
longer to publish if it has to go

599
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:14,880
through

600
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,679
a editing process or a review process

601
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,320
strategic reports are the highest level

602
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,440
report and that they

603
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,799
cover a lot of information the

604
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,039
the now famous mandy and apt-1 report is

605
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,720
an example of a strategic report

606
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,039
it covered the actor who they were

607
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,919
working for

608
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
where they worked um what types of

609
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,919
threats they had been using what their

610
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,960
goals were so on

611
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,480
it didn't really detail a single

612
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
incident or necessarily a single

613
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
campaign it was a much higher overview

614
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
of the actor

615
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
now if you are an embedded analyst you

616
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
might be thinking that

617
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,679
an apt-1 report isn't really something

618
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,799
that is

619
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
in your purview given how much time and

620
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
dedicated research effort

621
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
is required to produce that and how

622
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
frequently you have to adjust to the

623
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
changing threat landscape

624
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,559
there are still opportunities for

625
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,000
strategic reports for you

626
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
too though to me i would imagine this

627
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
looking like a report detailing a number

628
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,840
of campaigns

629
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
that all used the same entry vector and

630
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,600
tactic

631
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
maybe word macros and a suggested

632
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
mitigation such as

633
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
disallowing macros that come in

634
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
documents from the internet

635
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
this report would probably be going

636
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
pretty high up your management chain

637
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
and would require a lot of research over

638
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,880
the course of several incidents

639
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,120
some external research hard work editing

640
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
and would be suggesting a whole new

641
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,559
strategy that the company could take to

642
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,120
defense

643
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,559
defend against attackers

644
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
so to recap the difference in these

645
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
three types of reports a tactical report

646
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
is one incident an operational report is

647
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
multiple incidents strung together into

648
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
a campaign

649
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
in a strategic report is multiple

650
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
campaigns strung together to show

651
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
a pattern or strategy

652
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,559
all three types of these different types

653
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,520
of intelligence

654
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
may have different reports that fall

655
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
into them and there may be some reports

656
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,080
that you

657
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
are producing that you don't really feel

658
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
like fall

659
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
nicely or neatly into any of these and

660
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,480
that's okay

661
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
what is important is to answer your

662
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,840
three questions

663
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
and get um audience feedback going

664
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,840
forward and you'll be good to go

665
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,320
so now that you know what to do i want

666
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
to talk a little bit about what to avoid

667
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
when you're creating an intelligence

668
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,919
report to start off

669
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,960
it's important to avoid jargon

670
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
um especially if you're writing a report

671
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,559
for a

672
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
varied audience such as customers or

673
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
management

674
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
you may know what you're talking about

675
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
but at the end of the day

676
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
it's more important for your audience to

677
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,480
understand your report

678
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
than it is for them to know how smart

679
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,600
you are

680
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,440
not to mention a lot of jargony reports

681
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
that i've read are using that technical

682
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,039
language to describe

683
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,280
how something is working and they never

684
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
really use

685
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,720
any time of the report to describe why i

686
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
should care about that thing

687
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
the second pitfall to consider is

688
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,360
timeliness versus completeness

689
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
is it more important to let your

690
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
audience know about something now

691
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,200
or to wait and to make sure they know

692
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
more details later

693
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
depending on the type of report you're

694
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
writing the

695
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
question this question is probably

696
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,200
pretty easy to answer for a tactical

697
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,679
report

698
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,640
timeliness is critical you can send an

699
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
update later if you learn something more

700
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,919
for a strategic report completeness is

701
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,280
key

702
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
for an operational report though it can

703
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,960
be a little bit more tricky

704
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
so knowing that is tricky can help you

705
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
work with your team your management your

706
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
editors ahead of time to

707
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,559
determine which reports are more timely

708
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,440
and

709
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
which ones need to be more complete and

710
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
finally don't overwork your report

711
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
i know that writing and communicating

712
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,760
can be very difficult

713
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
and it can be tempting to want to make

714
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,440
changes and to make little edits

715
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,480
forever or to suddenly question your own

716
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
analysis

717
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
as soon as it's about to be sent off to

718
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
the customer

719
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,159
or to think that you really just need to

720
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
wait for one more bizarre loader

721
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,280
incident before you're ready to talk

722
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
about that malware

723
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,799
but at some point you just have to ship

724
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
your report when it's ready it's ready

725
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,120
and if you keep adding to it you're

726
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
eventually going to be taking away more

727
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,760
than you're actually adding

728
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,360
which brings us to water coloring

729
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
similarly with a painting if you add to

730
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
it too much

731
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,730
you're eventually taking it away

732
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,789
[Music]

733
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,039
so for my non-technical hobby slide

734
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,000
today i want to

735
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
talk about water coloring and i actually

736
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,919
picked this up

737
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
um during the pandemic so it's a fairly

738
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,320
new hobby to me

739
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,039
i started learning it from youtube or

740
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
blogs online and stuff like that but a

741
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
lot of those were geared towards people

742
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
that already had some experience with

743
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
painting or art which i did not they

744
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
weren't really geared towards total

745
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,600
beginners

746
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,640
so today i wanted to talk as someone who

747
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
is a beginner for other people who may

748
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
be interested in picking up this as a

749
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
new hobby for the first time

750
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
i chose specifically to talk about this

751
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,120
versus one of the hobbies that i've been

752
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
doing much longer because i think it's a

753
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
fun way to help newcomers

754
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
into the hobby together so we can all

755
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
learn together plus

756
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
if you're new to a hobby such as

757
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,559
painting especially you know water

758
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,760
coloring

759
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
it can be a little demotivating if

760
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
you're talking to someone who has been

761
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
doing it for a long time

762
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,159
and you find that you cannot reproduce

763
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,200
their paintings or

764
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
anything close to what they're able to

765
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,240
produce um

766
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
so i have some examples in my slides uh

767
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
that are what

768
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
the paintings of someone who is brand

769
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,480
new to this hobby would actually look

770
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,919
like

771
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,080
in addition i i want to talk about water

772
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,120
coloring because i feel like it's a

773
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,000
hobby that's super

774
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
accessible as i was thinking about what

775
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,159
of the hobbies i have i might want to

776
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:54,960
talk about

777
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,559
um some of my hobbies felt less

778
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,320
accessible such as like running or

779
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,279
exercise

780
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,360
not great for a varied audience which we

781
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,840
talked about with intelligence

782
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,000
communications

783
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
so my other hobbies like hiking it kind

784
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
of depends on where you live

785
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,039
um so i didn't really want to talk about

786
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,039
that and then stuff like the piano i was

787
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,880
like okay well you have to own a piano

788
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
and so i found that water coloring is a

789
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
hobby that is super accessible

790
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,159
that a lot of different people can do

791
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,000
from you know it doesn't really matter

792
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,279
where you live it doesn't matter what

793
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,960
stage of your life you're in

794
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
it's something that you can kind of pick

795
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,000
up at any point for a lot of people

796
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
so out of all the different types of art

797
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,120
available

798
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
that i could have chosen to talk about

799
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,760
why am i talking about water coloring

800
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
i tried every type of art imaginable

801
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
during this pandemic trying to find

802
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,000
things to do so i tried acrylic painting

803
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
i tried pastels digital painting colored

804
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,600
pencils

805
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
you name it i probably tried it and

806
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,360
watercolors ended up being my personal

807
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,840
favorite

808
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
because i have felt less pressure to be

809
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,520
perfect maybe this is a perfectionism

810
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,159
thing

811
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,880
um but i don't have a lot of natural

812
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,679
drawing

813
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,159
talent and i found with certain art

814
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
mediums such as colored pencils

815
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
you kind of have to be able to draw in

816
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,919
order for your

817
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,279
art to look anything like what you

818
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
wanted it to look like

819
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
with water coloring and some other types

820
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
of painting as well i have found that

821
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
it's a lot easier because you kind of

822
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,559
just do a couple of like

823
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,320
brush strokes or like dabbles on the

824
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
page and it kind of ends up looking like

825
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,080
you know a flower which is mostly what i

826
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
end up painting

827
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,559
um or something along the lines of what

828
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,640
you wanted it to look like

829
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,159
additionally i have found that water

830
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,400
coloring is less commitment than some of

831
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,039
the other

832
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
types of painting that i tried so

833
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
something like oil painting or acrylic

834
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,559
i need a canvas or a board and i

835
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,480
feel the need to fill that whole thing

836
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
up with a background

837
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
and a full scene or like a landscape

838
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
with watercolor you're just doing it on

839
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,360
paper

840
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,279
and i feel like i can just kind of

841
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
doodle almost with water coloring and it

842
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
feels like

843
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,679
so much less of a commitment than

844
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,760
filling up a whole canvas

845
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
um it when i was doing some acrylic

846
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,840
painting it felt a little daunting to

847
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,520
have the whole canvas and be like

848
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,799
okay i'm gonna have to fill this whole

849
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
thing up but because water coloring is

850
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,679
just on paper it's not daunting at all

851
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
um thirdly i have found that for me it's

852
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
very calming

853
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,919
it's relaxing it's semi-mindless it's

854
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,200
something that i can do while i'm

855
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,559
listening to music or listening to

856
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,520
podcasts

857
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
it's something that you could do while

858
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
you are listening to a virtual

859
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
conference put on during a pandemic

860
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,799
um you can do it with others when we can

861
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,320
do anything with others or you can do it

862
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,960
by yourself

863
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,279
and that makes it a really nice hobby

864
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,640
for me to have

865
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,400
and then finally as i mentioned i picked

866
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
this up during the pandemic which was

867
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,440
nice but i've also found that i think

868
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
going forward

869
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
it'll be very good for me for winter

870
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
because most of my hobbies are outdoor

871
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
hobbies

872
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
and um they're not always feasible in

873
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
the winter

874
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,760
so to start out i wanted to talk about

875
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,880
the difference between acrylic and

876
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,480
watercolor because i know acrylic is

877
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,400
another kind of beginner

878
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,320
painting medium that people will pick up

879
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,640
so i wanted to use these two paintings

880
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,600
as an example

881
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,799
of what i was talking about it being

882
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,039
less of a commitment so the painting on

883
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,159
the left is one

884
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,440
um that i did using acrylic and i it is

885
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
my attempt at painting the crow that

886
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,679
lives outside of my apartment

887
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,080
and as you can see i used a canvas and i

888
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
felt the need to fill up

889
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,600
the entire thing so i painted the whole

890
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
sky and i had to paint around my bird

891
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,399
and everything

892
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,919
and that was a little stressful and then

893
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,159
also it required me to have

894
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
an understanding of perspective so like

895
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,919
actual art

896
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,039
talent that i don't really have so

897
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,840
the buildings in that painting look a

898
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,279
little wonky because one is supposed to

899
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,960
be across the street

900
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,399
and it just it it took a lot more

901
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,360
time and planning than maybe i was

902
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,960
willing to give to any hobby during the

903
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,799
pandemic or ever

904
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,159
especially something that i'm brand new

905
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
at one pro for acrylics is that you can

906
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,919
paint light on top of dark

907
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,000
so you can see my crow's beak and his

908
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
eyes are gray and i painted those over

909
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
the top of his black

910
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,000
um feathers and in addition the building

911
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,880
across the street

912
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
the windows and the lights on the roof

913
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
were painted on top of the darker brown

914
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
once it had already dried so that's

915
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,840
that's nice because i didn't have to

916
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,320
plan out space for those ahead of time

917
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,399
the picture on the right is a little

918
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,159
bird that i had painted when i was very

919
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,440
new to water coloring

920
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
um and you can see that

921
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,200
there's no background there's no scene

922
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,120
he's just a bird i painted you know a

923
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
couple of brush strokes just for a

924
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,919
branch for him to sit on

925
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,600
but i didn't feel the need to fill up an

926
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
entire scene additionally he's just

927
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,159
painted on

928
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
watercolor paper so i wasn't devoting an

929
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,440
entire

930
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,279
canvas or board to this painting that

931
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
didn't feel like i was wasting money or

932
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
something if i messed it up

933
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
um also one pro for water coloring is

934
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,559
that

935
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,279
it's really easy to mix the colors so my

936
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,320
bird has both

937
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
blue and purple feathers and they mix

938
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,640
together nicely versus my crow the white

939
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
detailing on his

940
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,919
wing it does it didn't blend very well

941
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,520
just looks like lines

942
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,120
one con for water coloring is that you

943
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
cannot paint light on top of dark

944
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,760
so um for my bird's beak on the right i

945
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
had left

946
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,799
space for the orange beak but you can

947
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,480
see where it touches his

948
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
like the blue paint it kind of melded

949
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
together and doesn't look great

950
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,080
and then also the budding leaves that i

951
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
had put on my tree branch

952
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,039
you can see the branch through them

953
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
because the light green is significantly

954
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,760
lighter

955
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,760
than the dark brown branch behind them

956
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,919
so if any of this sounds intriguing to

957
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,039
you and you're interested in getting

958
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,720
started with water coloring

959
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,159
there are some supplies that you're

960
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,320
going to need and you can buy the

961
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,440
majority of these

962
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
in a starter kit which is what i did i

963
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
bought a watercolor starter kit from

964
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
michaels and it was super affordable

965
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
and it had enough supplies for me to

966
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
determine if water coloring was

967
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,919
something that i was actually going to

968
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,279
be interested in

969
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,320
once i decided it was i did end up

970
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,720
switching out some of these items for

971
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
higher quality versions of them

972
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,520
but i'll talk about which ones i

973
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,840
switched out when i get to them

974
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
so the first supply that you're going to

975
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,279
need is paint

976
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,240
this um seems pretty obvious there are

977
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,919
two types of paint

978
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,520
in water coloring there's paint that

979
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
comes in a tube

980
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,000
that is like a gel consistency it looks

981
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,640
like a

982
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
what you might expect acrylic paint to

983
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
look like but it's watercolor and then

984
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
there's paint that is dry and it comes

985
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,279
in a palette like what you might

986
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,200
remember from like elementary school

987
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
when you had those crayola paints in the

988
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
palette that you could paint with

989
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,640
um i have only used the tube paint so

990
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,000
this is an example of the two types of

991
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,440
paint that i'm talking about

992
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,880
um i've only used the tube type paint on

993
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,679
the left there

994
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,440
i have not used a palette paint yet so

995
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,120
all of my recommendations here are based

996
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,880
specifically on the tube paint i don't

997
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
know if they would be different for the

998
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,799
palette paint

999
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
so just something to keep in mind i will

1000
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,240
say

1001
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
the paint that came in my starter kit

1002
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,640
has proven to be good enough for me for

1003
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,360
beginner

1004
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
i am aware that nicer paints will make

1005
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,880
nicer paintings

1006
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
however as a beginner i'm really still

1007
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
learning the techniques of how to

1008
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,799
paint with watercolors and what i really

1009
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
enjoy doing and

1010
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
having nicer paints isn't going to make

1011
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
me a better artist yet

1012
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,640
and so i'm i have found that the starter

1013
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,600
kit paint is

1014
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,120
more than sufficient for someone who's

1015
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,640
really just starting out

1016
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
in this hobby

1017
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,240
the next item that you're going to need

1018
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,320
is thick paper

1019
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
obviously regular paper like printer

1020
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,919
paper won't do for water coloring

1021
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,360
because

1022
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,760
it's water so the painful paper will get

1023
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
all

1024
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,120
messed up and wrinkly and wet so you

1025
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,799
have to buy specifically watercolor

1026
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,240
paper

1027
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
the paper that came in the starter kit

1028
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
that i tried was good enough

1029
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,000
but i will say it was a very small ream

1030
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
and so once i decided that i liked

1031
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,120
watercolor and wanted to get into it

1032
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,600
more

1033
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
i ended up going out and buying more

1034
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,440
paper

1035
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,399
like a bigger ream of paper and while i

1036
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,000
was there i just bought thicker nicer

1037
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,320
paper

1038
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,080
additionally you're going to need one

1039
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,200
nice brush

1040
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
i have found that the starter kit came

1041
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
with like five brushes

1042
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,519
and i tried them all out and it was nice

1043
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,760
to be able to try them

1044
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,039
but um i didn't end up needing that many

1045
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,600
brushes

1046
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
and it the nicer the brush you have the

1047
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,399
better it'll be able to hold on to

1048
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,960
water and paint and so it actually does

1049
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,919
kind of matter

1050
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
to have a nicer brush so once i had

1051
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,880
tested out all the brushes from the

1052
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,840
starter kit

1053
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,200
i went back to the store and bought a

1054
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
upgraded much more quality version of

1055
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,799
the one that i

1056
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,360
actually ended up um

1057
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,679
liking and using and it has helped

1058
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,720
significantly

1059
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
i will say though this does you know

1060
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
kind of depend on the fact that

1061
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,559
i have been doing very small paintings

1062
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,240
i'm not doing like these huge scenes and

1063
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
if i was

1064
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,559
i would probably um need a bigger

1065
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,600
brush as well to paint the background um

1066
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,200
but because i'm just doing little

1067
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
flowers and stuff um

1068
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
i haven't needed that and the one brush

1069
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
is good enough for like doing small

1070
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,960
details with

1071
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
the tip of the brush and i can push down

1072
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,679
more to get like leaves or

1073
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,279
bird feathers if you will just whatever

1074
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,120
i'm looking for

1075
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,559
the next thing that you will need is a

1076
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,320
palette the palette that came in the

1077
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,679
starter kit is the only thing that i

1078
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,519
will say that i was not a huge fan of

1079
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,440
from the starter kit

1080
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,640
it was kind of small and flimsy and it

1081
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
really only had room for like six colors

1082
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
but not a lot of room to

1083
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
mix them together so i did actually go

1084
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,360
back to the store

1085
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,559
and buy a better palette um

1086
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,399
i actually have it right here and you

1087
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,240
can see that it has it's a mess right

1088
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
now but it has room for

1089
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
five colors but what i like is that it

1090
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
has this like

1091
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,840
trough area um and i have

1092
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,440
used that for mixing the paint colors

1093
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,679
together usually with a white and so i

1094
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
get a gradient of that color

1095
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,440
in the trough area and then i can just

1096
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
pick from the gradient for what i'm

1097
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
looking for and i can do

1098
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,639
something like what i attempted with

1099
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,960
these attempted cherry blossoms in the

1100
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
left of my slide there i just kind of

1101
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
picked it's all just one

1102
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,839
red that i mixed with white and then i

1103
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,679
just picked different

1104
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,399
pieces of paint off the gradient to make

1105
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,599
which color flower i was looking for

1106
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,639
the next thing you're going to need is

1107
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,280
actually two jars or cups if you've done

1108
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
painting in the past with like acrylics

1109
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,199
or

1110
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
oil painting you only need one but with

1111
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,520
watercolor you actually need a clean

1112
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,359
water horse as well so you will need two

1113
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,560
just something to keep in mind and you

1114
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,079
won't want to contaminate

1115
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,199
um your clean water with dirty water so

1116
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,239
that's all you're going to need

1117
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,119
um but there are some optional items

1118
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:49,760
that you

1119
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,599
can add if you would like that

1120
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,560
i have found have made my paintings more

1121
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,520
professional looking

1122
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
or in general just more fun and the

1123
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,280
first one is washi tape so washi tape is

1124
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
very inexpensive

1125
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,599
and it can be purchased almost anywhere

1126
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,480
i got mine at the art store

1127
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,040
and what it does is it adds a nice crisp

1128
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
border

1129
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,359
there we go a nice crisp border to your

1130
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,000
painting so you can see what i did here

1131
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,480
was i had two scenes from kind of the

1132
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,440
same

1133
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
painting and i had taped around both of

1134
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,200
them so it kind of gave it this like

1135
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,960
comic book feel where there's like two

1136
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,119
frames from the same scene

1137
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,800
and in addition it gave it a nice crisp

1138
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
line around the outside as well

1139
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,079
because without that you wouldn't really

1140
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,520
be able to achieve that with water

1141
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,960
coloring since water is wet and it'll

1142
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,520
just go all over your page otherwise

1143
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
additionally it is very satisfying when

1144
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,359
you have finished a painting

1145
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,599
to peel off the tape and reveal that

1146
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,400
very crisp

1147
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,359
line below it's worth it just for that

1148
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,800
additionally another thing you can add

1149
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
to your painting is pins and

1150
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,359
ink so i've heard about this on line

1151
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,119
when i was researching watercolor

1152
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,440
i saw a lot of people posting art that

1153
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,200
they were saying was like watercolor

1154
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,280
and ink and they were using the ink to

1155
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,520
add a lot of details to their

1156
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
painting so they were they were adding

1157
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,359
like strands of hair

1158
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
or um petals on a flower or what have

1159
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,520
you

1160
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,560
so i decided to try that out and

1161
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,640
there's probably some kind of artists

1162
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
ink that you may

1163
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,040
use for something like this but as a

1164
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
total beginner i wasn't going to

1165
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,280
buy that so i just used pens that i had

1166
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,079
in my house

1167
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,680
and i tested out a couple of them to see

1168
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
which one worked best or if any of them

1169
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,160
worked

1170
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,280
and i found that they did work at home

1171
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,400
pins so this is not

1172
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
the best painting obviously um but the

1173
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,440
one on the left

1174
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,640
is my attempt at using a bic pen to

1175
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
use a rose the one on the right is a

1176
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
paper mate gel pen and you can see that

1177
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,079
the big pen worked just fine i feel like

1178
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
for a starter

1179
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
who's getting started in watercoloring

1180
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,560
this works just fine

1181
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
and i used it to draw the whole flower i

1182
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
don't think it added much to the stem

1183
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,680
or the leaves but i will say for the

1184
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
petals of my rose

1185
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,160
this would otherwise just be a red blob

1186
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
and the pen gave it an outline um the

1187
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,640
paper mate one i did the same thing but

1188
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,119
it

1189
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,960
mixed with the water and made all of my

1190
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
colors this very

1191
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
murky gray ugly color so

1192
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,079
just watch out for that um another thing

1193
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,520
i will say is that i haven't done this

1194
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,480
very much

1195
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
because it requires the ability to draw

1196
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,680
which i

1197
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,040
don't feel like i'm good at and again i

1198
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
think this is maybe a perfectionism

1199
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,359
thing but i

1200
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,720
i don't like when i draw something and

1201
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,480
it doesn't look perfect and so i

1202
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,359
i prefer not painting with pens but it

1203
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,640
is an option if you want to add more

1204
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,920
details and you find that

1205
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
you're struggling to draw certain you

1206
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
know flowers or something that need more

1207
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,839
detail because the water just mixes

1208
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,160
together

1209
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
so to talk about the actual painting

1210
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
itself now um

1211
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,079
there are two main methods by which uh

1212
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,839
you can watercolor

1213
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,400
and the first one is wet on wet this is

1214
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,359
when you

1215
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,920
get just clean plain water on your brush

1216
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,640
and then you

1217
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
brush that water directly onto the paper

1218
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,720
um

1219
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,119
first and then you get the watercolor

1220
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,480
paint on your brush

1221
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,359
and then paint on top of the water that

1222
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,960
is on your page

1223
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,880
and this can achieve a very like smooth

1224
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
watery effect so you can see from my

1225
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,280
example painting on the right there

1226
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,400
the top blue paint area

1227
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,839
was wet on wet and um you can see it's

1228
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:32,880
fairly smooth

1229
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
you don't see too many brush strokes

1230
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
really it kind of like the edges are

1231
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,160
very smooth

1232
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
at the bottom edge where i didn't have

1233
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
any tape and it looks pretty nice

1234
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,440
and if i had used a lighter blue i used

1235
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,119
a darker one just for the example but if

1236
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,480
i had used a lighter one it would have

1237
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,200
made a good

1238
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
sky or background color however

1239
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,359
wet on wet is not good for details so if

1240
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,079
you see

1241
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,599
the red smudges below

1242
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,480
that was wet on wet um and i was trying

1243
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,240
to make little dots and i did this just

1244
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,079
to highlight that if you are going to be

1245
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,599
using watercolors to paint something

1246
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,520
specific you won't want to use the wet

1247
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
on wet technique

1248
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,160
wet on dry is when you skip the brushing

1249
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,520
on of the clean water

1250
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,079
and just paint your paint directly onto

1251
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,720
the dry

1252
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
page and so for my red dots on this

1253
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
example you can see that they didn't

1254
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,920
spread out at all so it's a really good

1255
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,240
way of getting detailed paint or

1256
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,280
sorry detailed drawings in your painting

1257
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,359
but for the blue section at the bottom

1258
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,119
you can see that it looks a bit scraggly

1259
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,560
you can see some brush strokes

1260
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,160
the top doesn't look very clean

1261
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
so i would not recommend necessarily

1262
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,599
using it for like a wide area if you're

1263
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,200
painting a background or something

1264
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
and these two techniques can be combined

1265
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,440
so you can paint a background

1266
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
um using wet on wet and then add your

1267
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,280
detailing on top

1268
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,200
using wet on dry and for that each

1269
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
painting that i had shown a little while

1270
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,800
ago that i have right here

1271
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
so that's what i had done here the sand

1272
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
and the sky were painted on

1273
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,079
with wet on wet and then once they had

1274
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,119
fully dried i

1275
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,160
added the bushes and the water on using

1276
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,240
or sorry painted the sand using wet on

1277
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
wet then once they were dry

1278
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
i painted the bushes on using wet on dry

1279
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,880
so as with any hobby when you first get

1280
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
started you're going to mess it up

1281
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,240
and that's fine because that's how you

1282
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,720
learn

1283
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,880
but there are a few things that i have

1284
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
done um

1285
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,839
that you can learn from my mistakes and

1286
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,880
hopefully not make the same ones

1287
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,520
so the first mistake i made was being

1288
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,560
left-handed

1289
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
i have been left-handed my whole life

1290
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
and yet somehow i always forget

1291
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,079
um and really what this mistake was is

1292
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:44,960
that

1293
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,160
watercolor paint is wet and um

1294
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,760
i'm not used to painting at all so when

1295
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,200
i first got into it i've been used to

1296
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,680
you know

1297
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
using a computer or writing or doing

1298
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,839
things that that won't transfer

1299
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,319
and if you touch the paint it's going to

1300
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,760
transfer all over your page so just

1301
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
something to keep in mind if you're

1302
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,920
brand new to painting

1303
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,119
if you're really happy with what you're

1304
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
doing and then you drag your hand

1305
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,640
through it

1306
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,920
it will make a mess and it will be

1307
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
frustrating so just keep that in mind if

1308
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,640
you're left-handed like me

1309
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,760
you may actually want to start from the

1310
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
right side of your page if you can

1311
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,760
the second mistake i made was just using

1312
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,160
way too much water this painting on the

1313
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,240
right was supposed to be a flower

1314
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
and it does not look obviously anything

1315
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,400
like a flower because i used just an

1316
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,160
inordinate amount of water

1317
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,880
so for the three circular purple flower

1318
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,359
heads i was trying to make flower buds

1319
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,760
i had way too much water on my brush and

1320
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,800
i didn't realize it

1321
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,720
and i painted directly under the page

1322
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
and then the second mistake i made

1323
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,359
was touching the stem directly to the

1324
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,000
flower

1325
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,240
so then all the paint ran together

1326
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
because water touched water

1327
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,160
and it made this horrible murky brown

1328
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,920
disgusting color

1329
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
there's a lot of ways to combat this the

1330
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,520
first is not to just get so much water

1331
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,880
on your brush in the first place

1332
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,640
but secondly i have found that it's very

1333
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,079
helpful for me

1334
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
to dab my brush off on a paper towel to

1335
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,480
get some of the water off

1336
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
and then third let it dry a little bit

1337
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,079
before adding more details and then

1338
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,440
fourth if you are adding those more

1339
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,240
details

1340
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,119
don't touch them to the other wet part

1341
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,640
and then the last mistake i want to talk

1342
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,200
about

1343
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,839
is don't just dive right into it and try

1344
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,119
and do a huge painting

1345
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,400
i think this was the very second

1346
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,599
painting i attempted when i was

1347
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,400
watercoloring

1348
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
and you can see it's just not very good

1349
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
it was very frustrating for me

1350
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,040
because i was like yeah i'm going to be

1351
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,560
great at watercoloring and i tried this

1352
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,520
huge painting

1353
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
and it was bad um because you really

1354
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,000
need to allow yourself the room to start

1355
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,560
small

1356
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,800
learn how to watercolor before you try

1357
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
to do a huge painting

1358
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,079
um so just give yourself room to learn

1359
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,920
so just as a final note for watercolor

1360
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,359
painting it's super

1361
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,440
easy to learn the basics and to do this

1362
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,200
i will show you my very first painting

1363
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,760
which is

1364
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,800
quite hideous and embarrassing um it was

1365
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
supposed to be a bird

1366
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,079
it is terrifying because it's not very

1367
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
good the beak

1368
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,079
just went into the feathers it looks

1369
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,920
awful but you can see a mere two months

1370
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,400
later

1371
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,720
i was able to paint these flowers and

1372
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
they look significantly better than the

1373
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,079
bird there's still room for improvement

1374
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,520
but you can see how far i was able to

1375
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,680
come in just a short amount of time

1376
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,359
i'm not going to say that it's easy to

1377
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,119
be an amazing watercolor artist

1378
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,440
but it's certainly beginner friendly for

1379
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,280
doodling or having a mindless hobby

1380
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,119
during you know winter it's also a

1381
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,200
really nice way to make gifts or cards

1382
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,000
for your friends or

1383
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,920
your family if i painted some of these

1384
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,760
flowers i could send those like a

1385
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,640
birthday card

1386
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,040
to a friend and that would be very nice

1387
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
that being said whether you like water

1388
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,760
coloring or not

1389
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,319
i recommend giving art a try there's so

1390
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,000
many different mediums of art out there

1391
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,359
and different people will like different

1392
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,000
ones i know my sister is a huge fan of

1393
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,480
gel pens with coloring books um digital

1394
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,680
art is really popular right now and

1395
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,000
there's free software like krita or

1396
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,160
whatever that you can use to try it out

1397
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,839
um some people might want to go the bob

1398
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,079
ross route and do oil paints

1399
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,079
experiment with several types of art and

1400
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,520
find one that works for you

1401
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
because really at the end of the day

1402
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,560
it's a very relaxing and fulfilling

1403
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,319
hobby to have

1404
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,800
um so with that i think i talked almost

1405
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,079
up to the minute but if we have any

1406
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,800
questions

1407
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,640
and any time for them i'd be happy to

1408
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,319
take them

1409
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,079
yeah we're about out of time but there

1410
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
are a few questions in chat if you could

1411
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,359
hang out with folks for a little while

1412
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,720
and answer some of them that'd be very

1413
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,160
much appreciated

1414
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,920
