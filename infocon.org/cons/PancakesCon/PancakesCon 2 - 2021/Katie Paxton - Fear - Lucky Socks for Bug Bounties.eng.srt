1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
all right so next up we have katie

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,760
paxton fear

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
who is going to be talking to us about

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,160
bug bounties and lucky socks

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,599
i didn't even know lucky socks are a

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,759
thing so this is pretty exciting for me

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,639
um and of course bug bounties are very

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,480
important topic to a lot of us right now

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,840
in a growing of being

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
growing importance to all of us blue

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,880
team red team alike

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
so very excited for this talk uh katie

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
over to you

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
yeah thank you very much um so

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
today i'm going to be giving two talks

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,920
which are very closely interlinked and

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,559
you might be

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,879
surprised by this but if you happen to

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,399
be somebody who follows me

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
you're maybe not as surprised as it may

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
first initially

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
seem uh so the first thing i'm going to

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
do is introduce myself because as

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,960
you watch enough conference

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,039
presentations you deliver enough of them

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
the first thing you have to prove is not

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
your ideas but in fact you're worth

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
listening to

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
so my name is katie i'm also called

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
inside a phd

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,720
i'm a lecturer in cyber security at

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
manchester metropolitan university

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,439
um but i'm sure none of you know me

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,479
because of a lecture at manchester

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
metropolitan university i'm sure

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
most other people know about one of my

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,640
many hobbies

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,439
now i'm sure you're actually well known

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
uh you know me just because of my

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,479
knitting but i'm sure you might have

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,040
also

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
perhaps heard about my bug bounty

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,560
hunting

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
so i do bug bounties as a hobby right i

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,880
indulge on them on my evenings and

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,759
weekends

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,439
and i also make a lot of youtube videos

48
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,040
talking about bugs and how

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,079
to find them i've found about 30 valid

50
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,520
vulnerabilities so far

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,799
i started in june 2019 um

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,960
and i found bugs in organizations that

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
range from the u.s department of defense

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
to uber to verizon so really a full

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
spectrum

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
of different companies and i wanted to

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
start this presentation by really giving

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
the story of my first bug

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
um and this is definitely me when i

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
found my first bug for sure

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
so i was invited i was very fortunate to

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
be invited

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,720
as a mentee at hakka one live event

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,319
and when i was there i found my first

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
two bugs and i earned about

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
1k it's not a huge amount of money

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
certainly not

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
for like a lot of tech people

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
but for me it was a lot of money and i

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
went i left that event

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
thinking i'd never done any kind of

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
penetration testing

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
i actually um could have done security

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
at university but turned it down

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
because i thought security sounds really

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
hard i don't want to do that

77
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,840
um but i was like kind of bullied into

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,800
going to this

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
live event and i was like right that's

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,040
it i'm bad at this this was a complete

81
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
flute this is never happening again

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
and i was very fortunate to be invited

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,400
back uh to another

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
live event uh during defcon and i

85
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
thought well i'm based in the uk

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
that's a free trip over to vegas during

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
defcon

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
okay i might be bad at it but i'm

89
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
certainly gonna take advantage of this

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
and i found two more bugs while i was

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
there now as a previous life after i

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
finished university i went off in the

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
world and i was a data scientist for a

94
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
bit and i found two more bugs while i

95
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,519
was there and my inner data scientist

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,519
was like yep there's a trend there

97
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,760
uh that is you know two attempts and

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,680
four valid vulnerabilities like that

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
that's pretty

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
working pretty good and as i'm sitting

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
here counting all of my money

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
um i'm spent at all on yarn i went to

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,959
one yard shop

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,440
and i spent so much money on yarn you

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
would not believe how much yarn costs

106
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,360
when you have one thousand dollars

107
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
in your pocket roughly the same um

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
i haven't even used that yarn either

109
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
it's kind of special to me now it's like

110
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,159
my very first bounty yarn

111
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,920
um but i did i did try and spend it all

112
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,200
on on um on yarn um

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,319
so if you're not familiar with the

114
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
concept because not everybody is what is

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
bug bounties

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
now in a nutshell it's freelance cyber

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
security bug hunters are

118
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
freelance cyber security experts who

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,519
find security vulnerabilities

120
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
in other people's products and services

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
instead of a penetration test where you

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,760
pay for an

123
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
engagement with a bug bounty hunter you

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
as an organization

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
pay per valid bug you pay get paid for

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
the vulnerability found

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
and the higher the risk for the

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
vulnerability so the higher impact it

129
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
has the more devastation the scarier is

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,479
the higher the reward and rewards can

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
really vary like they can go

132
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
from like a hundred dollars to a hundred

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,240
thousand dollars like me

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
spectrum is huge and you hear people

135
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
like me talking about how they spent all

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
of their money on yarn you hit other

137
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,639
people who have done up the entire

138
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,440
kitchen

139
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
so they really do vary and it's

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
primarily about risk

141
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
right so the idea is is that

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
if you pay a bug bounty hunter a lot of

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
money they'll be more

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
kind of uh interested in hacking you

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
and you finding out about it than uh one

146
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,479
of the bad guys essentially uh

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
who might be more interested in making

148
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
money off of you than taking your money

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
from you

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
but this kind of all rolls into kind of

151
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
one idea it's just what is a bug

152
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
so when we think about bugs in software

153
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
we're actually often thinking of like

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,880
software issues

155
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
like very much a case of um oh there's a

156
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
bug in this piece of software and

157
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
it crashed but actually when we talk

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,759
about it in the terms of bug bounty

159
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,960
hunting

160
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
software crashing is not that much of an

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
issue and you're not going to be paid a

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
hundred thousand

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
a hundred thousand dollars for that what

164
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
you're actually going to get paid is

165
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,360
nothing

166
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
you'll get a very nice email saying

167
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,759
thank you but that's not on the

168
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
developer roadmap this quarter

169
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,440
but what did when we talk about bug

170
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
bounce accounting what we're actually

171
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
talking about is security

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
vulnerabilities

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
so these aren't just like regular

174
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
software issues these are regular

175
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
software issues which have

176
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
a security impact now that impact might

177
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
be really really small

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
that impact might be oh if an attacker

179
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
was to exploit this they

180
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,680
could um like update your social media

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,400
profile

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,759
without you knowing um versus

183
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
like some exploits which can be

184
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,440
something like you know if someone wants

185
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
to exploit this they could take

186
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
all of your data um and really what

187
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
makes bug bound hunting perhaps a bit

188
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
different from other kinds of

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
penetration testing

190
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
is that you can't in bug banter you

191
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,600
can't just find

192
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
the bugs you have to show you can

193
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
exploit them and actually play that role

194
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,319
of a

195
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
potential attacker and primarily when

196
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,600
you think about like

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
why am i paying all of this money to

198
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
have someone penetrate penetration do a

199
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
deliver a presentation test but online

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
actually what you're paying for is the

201
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
exploitation step

202
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
and what people are paying for is being

203
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,039
scared

204
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,080
um but not in the kind of ransom

205
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,360
approach of being scared but in the

206
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
kind of that's a super super spooky

207
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,120
vulnerability

208
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
let's maybe not leave that in any more

209
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,400
than it has

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
then it is already been in there for

211
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,400
several years and we've not noticed

212
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
and this is what makes bug branch

213
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
hunting challenging

214
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
it is the exploitation of a bug not

215
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,479
just the finding of one so this all kind

216
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
of rolls together being like

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
is that legal are you sure that's legal

218
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,000
are you positive that's legal um and the

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
answer is yes

220
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
so bug bounty hunting is 100 legal

221
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
comma as long as you follow the rules of

222
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
engagement we have rules

223
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,280
you can't just start hacking random

224
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
companies like

225
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
do not do that i explicitly telling you

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
not to do that

227
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
like don't do that don't touch them

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
don't get curious don't oh i'll just try

229
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
no just leave websites alone unless you

230
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
are following the rules of engage

231
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
engagement and what we'll see here is

232
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,520
that

233
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
if you're not sure um there are programs

234
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
that have listed on their page and

235
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
website that says very clearly

236
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,240
here are the um the rules please don't

237
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
break them

238
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
now the other thing from this is like

239
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,479
okay what about um kind of more broadly

240
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
legally speaking things like at least in

241
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
the uk the computer misuse act

242
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,599
in the us like the uh computer fraud act

243
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,360
so the way these legal definitions often

244
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,759
work

245
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
is they have this idea of permission

246
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
associated with them

247
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
so if you are following the rules and

248
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,280
you're not breaking the rules

249
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
and you are listening to people and

250
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
you're not being bad

251
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
you have permission to do this there's

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
not a case that is like

253
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,919
you don't have mission you will have

254
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,400
permission to do this and on top of that

255
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,320
programs then guarantee something called

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
safe harbor

257
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,159
which is the idea that says hey even if

258
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,719
you

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
were to do something bad we're not going

260
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
to prosecute as long as you follow

261
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
these rules of engagement and again

262
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
follow the rules

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
katie is not saying hack random

264
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
companies katie is saying

265
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,839
follow the rules and i have to stress

266
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,320
this

267
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
because what tends to happen when i

268
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
deliver these kind of talks is people

269
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
get really excited about what they can

270
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
do with this

271
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,839
and really curious and then start

272
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,000
touching things and you're not supposed

273
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,640
to touch

274
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
things don't touch things unless you

275
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
have permission to touch them

276
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
with that in mind if you would like

277
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
permission to touch them um

278
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
often uh these bug banter programs are

279
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
run by bug bands platforms release on

280
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,040
them

281
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
now they're third parties in there so

282
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
you have your target

283
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
you have you the hacker and then in

284
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
between you have the platform

285
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
now you might be thinking but why and

286
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
platforms offer um

287
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
a few kind of useful services so on one

288
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
side they offer things like triage

289
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
services

290
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
they also offer kind of smaller scopes

291
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,519
so

292
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
let's say you're a company and you say

293
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
well our infrastructure can't really

294
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
support

295
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
um like the entire internet hacking this

296
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,399
um let's do that to say 50 people to

297
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,519
start with

298
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
um while we get kind of my

299
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,160
infrastructure up and running so that's

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
one thing they do

301
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,760
on the on the hacker side they're

302
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
basically like a one-stop shop you know

303
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,399
they let you

304
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
kind of sign up for one account and hack

305
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
a bunch of different companies you're

306
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,079
not necessarily limited to like

307
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
you know just following say facebook's

308
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
program right you also have all

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
these other options um and all the

310
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
things they do is they coordinate things

311
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
like payments

312
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
so if you say want to be paid in

313
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,399
cryptocurrency

314
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,200
um then you would want one that supports

315
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
cryptocurrency

316
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
it's that's just how they tend to work

317
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
um and there's a bunch of them so

318
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
you have integrity hacker one bug crowd

319
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
synack yes we hacked zerocopter

320
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
detectify and more i've forgotten

321
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
um because i don't remember all of them

322
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
the two big ones are hacka1 and bug

323
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
crowd by far like the larger

324
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,760
um kind of two websites uh integrity

325
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
synac have much smaller programs but

326
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
actually they offer kind of more

327
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
specialist

328
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
kind of option so like for integrity

329
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
they offer a lot of european

330
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
stuff so especially they focus on the

331
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
benelux area so

332
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
belgium luxembourg the netherlands

333
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
uh those kind of kind of area and

334
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,240
detectify

335
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
is kind of unique as well because what

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
you do with them is you sign up

337
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,040
to um hunt for bugs but actually that

338
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,079
gets powered

339
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,519
that though it goes on to apparent

340
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,640
automated scanner it's a bit weird but

341
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
that's kind of they're all a bit

342
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
different if you're not sure and you're

343
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
like this sounds kind of interesting

344
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,839
would like to have a go haka one or bug

345
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
crowd are by far the two easiest ones to

346
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,640
get started with

347
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
but how do you decide a hacker on a bug

348
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,839
crowd well um

349
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
this is when we get to who you can hack

350
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
now there are a lot of options and who

351
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
you can hack

352
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
so you have the us air force etsy uber

353
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
verizon github paypal mastercard

354
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
nintendo goldman sachs so you can see

355
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
there's actually quite a wide range

356
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
of organizations there some things we

357
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
think of kind of newer technologies

358
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
uber spotify twitter we then have kind

359
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,720
of

360
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
more corporate um things like verizon

361
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
hp we also have like specialist stuff

362
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
nintendo tesla where you have video

363
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
games

364
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
and cars you also have financial

365
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
institutions mastercard and paypal you

366
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
can see it's really quite a broad

367
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,279
range of like

368
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
choices in target and then depending on

369
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
kind of what

370
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
targets you're interested in um you then

371
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
choose a website so if you want to hack

372
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
etsy you have to go on bug crowd you

373
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,959
want to hack github you've got to go and

374
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,680
hack a one

375
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
it's just how they work now these aren't

376
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
the only choices you have but i'll talk

377
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,240
about that in a second

378
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
most people don't actually like limit

379
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
themselves to one platform it turns out

380
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
you can just sign up anywhere

381
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
you don't actually like there's no um

382
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
loyalty program for staying on a certain

383
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,880
platform

384
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
most people join all of them and then

385
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
pick something that interests them

386
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
it's really quite straightforward for

387
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
them now you don't need to use a bug

388
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,040
badge platform

389
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
so many companies run external bug

390
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
bounty programs facebook and microsoft

391
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
are the two big ones even small

392
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
companies may reward

393
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
a bounty for disclosing vulnerability

394
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,519
even if they don't have a bug bounce

395
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
program

396
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,760
however this can result in legal action

397
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
this can result in people being very

398
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
unfriendly

399
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,279
um this they are not obliged to pay you

400
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,399
at all

401
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,040
um and what you might be doing is

402
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
extorting them

403
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
so not only were you getting legal

404
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,360
problems for

405
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
you know breaking the computer mission

406
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
you sat breaking the computer fraud act

407
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
um you might also be breaking extortion

408
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,720
laws

409
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
so my recommendation is don't do that

410
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
um one really cool thing that's

411
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,519
happening

412
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
is um some open source projects may have

413
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
bug bounties available

414
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
um quite a few will offer kind of

415
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
bounties as part of like a larger

416
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
program it's kind of neat if you want to

417
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,519
care if you care more about like open

418
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
source side of things

419
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
now you're probably listening to all of

420
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
this and thinking yeah but what are you

421
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
actually doing

422
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,199
you're getting paid money for this

423
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,120
what are you doing what is your job

424
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
actually um

425
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
so to kind of borrow a bit of an analogy

426
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
from the the previous

427
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
presenter that was not planned but uh

428
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
i'm very hungry

429
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,160
um we have ingredients so we need

430
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
burp suite or os zap so they're both

431
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
proxies don't worry i'll talk to you

432
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,959
about those in a bit

433
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,360
um we need a target so we just talked

434
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
about how to find a target

435
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
and some knowledge about bug hunting

436
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,399
specifically

437
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
what bugs are out there exactly what am

438
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,839
i looking for

439
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
and the general recipe is you know hakum

440
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,240
whatever that means write the report and

441
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
then finally get paid at the end

442
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
so with that in mind um how to get into

443
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
bug bounty

444
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
so in short what you need to learn now

445
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,199
i'm

446
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,839
kind of described as these five steps um

447
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,320
of course

448
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
indexes all start at zero so step zero

449
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,399
is learn how the web works

450
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
now quite often people will jump

451
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
straight up into like exploiting bugs

452
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
without really understanding the

453
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,880
underlying technology of how the

454
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
internet works

455
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
um and that can mean that you start to

456
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
get in a position where you don't really

457
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,240
know what you're doing and you might

458
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,360
accidentally

459
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
um cause either unintended harm or you

460
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,920
might think you've got a bug but

461
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,480
actually

462
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
what you found is just how the internet

463
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
works

464
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
the next step is really uh how to use

465
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,440
burp

466
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,839
slash zap so how to use the tools of the

467
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,720
trade

468
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,959
uh next one is what bugs are actually

469
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,760
out there

470
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
and then really the next one is kind of

471
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
they're both interlinked which is how to

472
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
exploit them

473
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
and this fourth step here is to practice

474
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
exploiting them so

475
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
you know it's not just the kind of

476
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,199
knowing what's out there

477
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
it's also getting that kind of

478
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,800
exploitation step and also practicing it

479
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
so with that in mind how does the

480
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
internet work

481
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,079
and i took a networking course when i

482
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
was doing my undergraduate degree

483
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,000
i'm an undergraduate in computer science

484
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
and i had a networking course and i went

485
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,000
to all my lectures

486
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,320
like a good student because i'm a nerd

487
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
and i couldn't help but

488
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
think that the internet is magical and

489
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
shouldn't exist

490
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,279
and if you learn networking and don't

491
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
come out with that kind of um

492
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
uh like result of being like the

493
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,440
internet should not exist

494
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,000
how does this work this is sorcery i

495
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,519
think something has gone wrong in your

496
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,040
education

497
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
um the internet is actually really

498
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
complex and that's good in terms of

499
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
being a big bounty hunter because

500
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,920
there's quite a lot of things the

501
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,279
internet wasn't built for

502
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,399
that we use it for so a really like good

503
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,360
example here

504
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
is the fact that http by default is

505
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
stateless so it doesn't care who you are

506
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,560
from

507
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
like one website to another page on the

508
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
website like it doesn't care who you are

509
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,000
it doesn't know who you are

510
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
but we went and invented logging in um

511
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
which means that

512
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,440
that then wasn't going to work and then

513
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,279
we had to invent cookies to do that

514
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
unfortunately then cookies then led to

515
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,880
things like cross-site scripting and the

516
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
ability to steal cookies

517
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
um when we then start going well we'll

518
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,320
make some cookies secure

519
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
um so it's less of an issue you then

520
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
have on top of that oh

521
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
that's fine we'll just use um a

522
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
vulnerability called csrf in order to do

523
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
the same thing and steal your account

524
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
and you go well actually we've invented

525
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
another cookie to solve that problem

526
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
and you end up realizing that the

527
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
internet is quite literally

528
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,760
like built like a house of paper cards

529
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
if you're sitting there

530
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
blowing all that um but that's the first

531
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,079
thing to learn

532
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
like i would say your bare minimum to

533
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,520
start with is what our request is

534
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
what our responses and what the

535
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
difference between the two

536
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,799
are the next kind of thing here is then

537
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,319
uh using zap or burp now they're both

538
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
do the same thing they're proxies now

539
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
you might be more familiar with proxies

540
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,720
as in

541
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
like what you used at school to get

542
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
around like your school's

543
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
firewalls to stop you from looking at

544
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,039
stuff on the internet you shouldn't have

545
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,600
been

546
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
like playing games all day um but

547
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,960
actually what these

548
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,039
do is they sit between like your

549
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,120
computer and the internet

550
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
and we'll show you what your computer is

551
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
doing like you know we load up a website

552
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
and we've never seen a request we never

553
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
know what our responses

554
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
we don't know that there's actual text

555
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
that's being sent

556
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
and i've been a web developer since i

557
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
was about 13 i was very into neopets as

558
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
a child

559
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
super like going to computers for a

560
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
really young age started programming

561
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,360
super young age it was until june 2019

562
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
um so when i was 25 26

563
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
that i'd ever seen a request before or a

564
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
response and seen what they look like

565
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
like with the headers and everything um

566
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,480
but this is what they do they sit in

567
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
between and what we want to do

568
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,280
as a bug bounty hunter is touch them

569
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
like we want to start fiddling with all

570
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
of the little things in here to try and

571
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
make it do something it shouldn't do

572
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
so if we see an id we want to change it

573
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
we see a number we want to make it

574
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
negative we see

575
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
you know um like any other values we

576
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,320
want to start playing with them

577
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
now what bugs are out there so most

578
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
people will give you the oauth top 10

579
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,039
list

580
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,280
if you know the os top 10 you'll realize

581
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,200
this is not the oauth top 10

582
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
and you'd be correct this is hacker 1's

583
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
top 10.

584
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
now the reason why there's a slight

585
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
difference is because

586
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
what actually gets found and what others

587
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,720
tells you are out there is quite

588
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
different

589
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,559
um but the kind of key issues are things

590
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
like cross-site scripting the ability to

591
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,559
inject javascript into a page

592
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,880
improper authentication so not logging

593
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,919
in correctly

594
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,720
information disclosure so being able to

595
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
access so you shouldn't you know secret

596
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,440
file.txt

597
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
is available publicly on the web

598
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,480
privilege escalation

599
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
turning your low-level account to an

600
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
administrator

601
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
sql injection or sql injection which is

602
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
um

603
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
being able to inject database commands

604
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
into the database

605
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
code injection so the ability to inject

606
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,160
raw code and have it return something

607
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
primarily this is things like shells

608
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,840
server side request forgery or ssrf

609
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
which is um this idea of using the web

610
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
page as a kind of

611
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,160
door into internal networks insecure

612
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
direct object reference or sometimes

613
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
called

614
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,600
oh god broken object level authorization

615
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
which mean the same thing which is that

616
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
you have an id

617
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,799
and you can access a resource that isn't

618
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,400
yours by the id

619
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,159
improper access control same kind of

620
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
idea and csrf which is um

621
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
client-side request forgery which is

622
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
abusing the way your browser handles

623
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,320
cookies

624
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,240
in order to do something on your account

625
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
without you knowing

626
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,799
slides right now yeah

627
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
i should be sharing slides am i not you

628
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,559
are not sharing them on the zoom

629
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,679
i didn't want to interrupt you because

630
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,840
you're rocking and rolling sorry

631
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
my bad it's good i'll fix this problem

632
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
looks good are we good now

633
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,120
perfect okay excellent no that's fine i

634
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
don't know how to use a computer i just

635
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,760
break them

636
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,640
and evidently this also extends to zoom

637
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,280
um

638
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
so it's fine uh so what should i

639
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
actually learn so i've stolen some data

640
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
here from someone who isn't me

641
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,039
um which is the same list but now

642
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,039
instead of like organized by

643
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,679
um most common vulnerabilities it also

644
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
now shows the year-on-year growth

645
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,760
now why is that important well because

646
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
you may have realized

647
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,890
especially if you're insecurity that um

648
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,120
[Music]

649
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
things like estrogen injection are not

650
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,360
as popular as they used to be

651
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,480
um just because people are now a bit

652
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
more aware of how to stop them you're

653
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
very rarely gonna get an sql injection

654
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,360
which is just

655
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
one equals equals one uh dash dash

656
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
anymore like it's just not going to be

657
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
the case they're far

658
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
more specific now what we really want

659
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
is the um bugs you want to find are ones

660
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
that are most common

661
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,200
and also are not currently reducing

662
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,120
so for example cross-site request

663
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,159
forgery csrf is actually going down

664
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
because um with uh like

665
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
the way the browsers are currently

666
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
changing how cookies work which is same

667
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,039
site by default

668
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,400
um they're just changed it now so

669
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
really what i'd like to take away from

670
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,480
this is what's actually worth learning

671
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
so first is information disclosure

672
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
second one is access control

673
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,880
third one is idols and the final one is

674
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
xss but a really good place to start out

675
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,360
if you are curious about learning this

676
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,240
more i have an entire youtube

677
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
channel that talks all about them and

678
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
all of their little intricacies

679
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,200
um and the next thing i mentioned was

680
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
you know how to exploit them

681
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,039
so we have security creators.video

682
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,400
and there's a bunch of people who also

683
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
make youtube content so i can't be

684
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
ever accused of um you know

685
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,039
self-promotion if i also promote

686
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,120
other people as well my name is also on

687
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
this list you should definitely

688
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
subscribe to my content

689
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,360
um so one other way i really like to do

690
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,159
is write up so

691
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,000
listening to how other people like

692
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
figure this stuff out can be really

693
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
helpful

694
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
in um working out how you can exploit

695
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,640
things in the future

696
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
there's also disclosed reports so both

697
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,240
hacka1 and bug crab

698
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,080
just disclose reports publicly you can

699
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
go ahead and read them

700
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,280
people also often suggest courses i

701
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
don't really like courses

702
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
because i think um with bug bounties

703
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
most people think they're going to

704
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
become millionaires and then spend money

705
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
they don't have to become millionaires

706
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
and i just don't think that's very good

707
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,440
to

708
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
recommend so i'm not going to recommend

709
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
courses but i am going to recommend the

710
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,600
multitude of free resources out there

711
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
and that goes as well for practice

712
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,159
so i really like like some of the free

713
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,960
resources

714
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,039
the web security academy by portugal

715
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,480
there who made buck

716
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
um they do like a bunch of labs on all

717
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
kinds of like vulnerabilities

718
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,720
we have the haka 101 ctf by hacka1 which

719
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
is published by haka one of course

720
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
um and honestly there's so many like

721
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
web-based ctfs out there like this

722
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
i can't make like one recommendation and

723
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
go here is everything you need

724
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,880
and now you can go off and um just sort

725
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
it out yourself you now know

726
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,000
um i think that it's really good to get

727
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
a bunch of different practices

728
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,559
my favorite way of practicing is to

729
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
actually hack something

730
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
i think by the time you're listening to

731
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
me talking you knew more you know more

732
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,600
listening to me than i did when i

733
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,919
first started so i can only imagine

734
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,360
that's repeatable

735
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,039
uh and i've recommend some paid

736
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
resources here so try hack me

737
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
pen tester lab pro bug bounty hunter

738
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,240
same kind of idea you just pay for it um

739
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
but you know maybe don't start out by

740
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
paying for things maybe just start out

741
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,640
seeing whether or not you like it

742
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
then decide if you want to pay for it so

743
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
it's all about luck versus skill

744
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
now i'm going to tell you something most

745
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
people don't tell you which is that bug

746
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
bounty is partly luck

747
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
to find bugs and especially to find them

748
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,360
well

749
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
it's a combination of skill and luck now

750
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,440
when you first start out you're probably

751
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,000
looking

752
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,039
at like 80 luck 20 skill

753
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,000
and as you improve your skill becomes

754
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
more of a factor and luck less of a

755
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,559
factor

756
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
and what pros really like the people who

757
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
make literally millions have found out

758
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
is they've developed specialities of

759
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,919
things they're good at so

760
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,440
when you first start out it can very

761
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
much feel like you versus the person

762
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
they tell you not to worry about meme

763
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
but actually when you get first start

764
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
out you can actually find more than you

765
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,039
think you do

766
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
um but let's talk about turning the tide

767
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
in our favor

768
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
quite often people will tell you go for

769
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,240
a public program

770
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,360
go for a public a private program

771
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,960
if you're really worried you can go for

772
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
a private program if you sign up hacker

773
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
101 and you do some of the ctf

774
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,279
not only will you learn something but

775
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
you will also then get

776
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,559
private invites so you can start

777
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,200
actually hacking

778
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,480
we also have industries so any industry

779
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
if you've already used an application

780
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
that is a huge like thing to start out

781
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,640
with

782
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
um what asset to hack mobile apps most

783
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,279
people don't have mobile apps

784
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
but i'm gonna be honest with you and

785
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,559
tell you

786
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,200
my secret because my secret is the socks

787
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
it's the socks it's definitely the socks

788
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
i always find bugs when i wear socks

789
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
of course i never don't wear socks to

790
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,320
hump bugs because why would i do that

791
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,120
that's not very lucky these things are

792
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,760
obviously not

793
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
related at all and it's really the socks

794
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
which are doing things

795
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,640
so what makes a lucky sock lucky

796
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,279
um well it is making them yourself by

797
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,440
your own two hands with string

798
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,000
and needles yes if you watch my youtube

799
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
videos and listen to all my other talks

800
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
you will now have a live demo

801
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
unfortunately the live demo wasn't in

802
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
the part of the presentation you perhaps

803
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
expected it to be in this time

804
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,559
so let's talk about making your own

805
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,440
lucky socks and how you can do it

806
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,480
so knitting in a nutshell so knitting is

807
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
the act of turning

808
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,720
string so we call it yarn that's yarn

809
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,039
not

810
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
wool in the uk people often call it wool

811
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
but it is uh

812
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
it is just called yarn and it can be

813
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,279
made out lots of materials not just wool

814
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,919
now we use our knitting needles so these

815
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,960
things

816
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
they're not very sharp like they're very

817
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
much like not not very sharp at all

818
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,720
um and we turn yarn and we do it into

819
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,440
stuff

820
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
and how do we do that well we do loops

821
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
so we have loops and we have loops and

822
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,120
then we have loops

823
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
and there's a lot of loops now in

824
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
knitting you have two main stitches so

825
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
the first one

826
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
is called the knit stitch and the second

827
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
one is called the purl stitch

828
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,360
now the important thing is that um the

829
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,080
sorry this is the live demo part um

830
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
so the purl stitch is basically the back

831
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,440
of the next knit stitch

832
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
you're just gonna have to live with it

833
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,120
well uh before i get my live demo done

834
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,240
um and we can knit either something flat

835
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,159
which is where you often see like my two

836
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
needles here are connected with a cable

837
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
um but quite often if you've ever seen

838
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
like knitting

839
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,360
as like on television they're two giant

840
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
straight needles

841
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
and that's knitting flat i'm going to

842
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,039
show you how to knit in the round

843
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
because obviously socks

844
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
are not flat and we either measure

845
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,960
knitting needles

846
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
in millimeters so that's european sizes

847
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,360
or us sizes and which are kind of just

848
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,080
arbitrary and uh here are the two

849
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
different knitting needle types so on

850
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
the one side you have

851
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,720
um the cable needles with a cable so

852
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,960
this is knitting in the round

853
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
and you also have the the the straight

854
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,480
needles there's also other types of

855
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,679
knitting needles i'm not going to go too

856
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,640
much into them

857
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,799
but we also have double pointed needles

858
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,240
which if you've ever watched somebody

859
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,159
knit with dpns you will know it looks

860
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
like absolute wizardry

861
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,760
because this is a person that have an

862
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,799
octopus

863
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,120
of the sharp things pointing out at you

864
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
it's like don't mess with them

865
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,919
and i'm also going to recommend a

866
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,399
website called ravelry now ravelry has

867
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,840
not been doing great things

868
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
i'm not going to get into the knitting

869
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
community's multitude of drama

870
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,919
but twitter for knitters

871
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,840
so ravelry is a great place to get

872
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
signed up to if you're interested in

873
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,559
knitting or crochet

874
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,240
um because it literally has every single

875
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
pattern you can have patterns you can

876
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,840
search for patterns you can

877
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
like then post your progress of patterns

878
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
and then you can see

879
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,919
all of the patterns however comma

880
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,919
if you have any kind of seizure or

881
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,440
migraine disorders

882
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,559
i would look into the alternatives for

883
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
viewing the website because some people

884
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,159
have found that it gives them migraines

885
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,919
um because they've made some very

886
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,600
questionable design choices in the past

887
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
few weeks

888
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
so let's talk about what you'll need to

889
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,039
get started

890
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
so if you want to make socks which i'm

891
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
assuming you do um

892
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
you will either need a us size one

893
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,559
needle so to give you

894
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
a kind of example this second is a us

895
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
size five

896
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,760
yeah this is a us size five

897
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,960
um and us size one looks like

898
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,159
uh like very thin it's like toothpicks

899
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,440
i should've really brought one over with

900
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
me and i recommend you get started

901
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,720
with one with a cable attached to it and

902
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
you need to

903
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
get have at least a 32 inch cable if you

904
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,600
are in the eu

905
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,559
the size you need is 2.2 millimeters

906
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,080
and you also need some fingering weight

907
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,520
yarn oh actually i had some information

908
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,080
about that

909
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
so you need to look for a mix of 75 um

910
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,799
wool and 25 nylon the nylon gives the

911
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,159
stock strength

912
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,360
good vegan options cotton and bamboo um

913
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
and you can see here this is an example

914
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
of uh

915
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
of like what it looks like if you want

916
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,799
thicker socks um

917
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
us size five for dk weight yard so this

918
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
is the kind of this is dk weight yarn

919
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,159
it's not like super thin um but it's

920
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,919
it's a bit thicker

921
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,080
or us-6 if you're in the us you'll find

922
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,679
probably fine you can find worse dead

923
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,000
or a dk and worsted weight ball of yarn

924
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,519
now if you're thinking okay why do i

925
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,960
actually buy this stuff

926
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,159
yarn.com if you're in the us um nitpicks

927
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,360
as well if you're in the us

928
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,120
though i understand nitpix are having

929
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
some supply issues at the moment so you

930
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,600
may want to

931
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,720
consider that um wall warehouse if

932
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,039
you're in the uk

933
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,399
um and damores which is both uk and us

934
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,000
um but i'm going to recommend your local

935
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
yarn store the pandemic has pretty much

936
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,200
ruined

937
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
a lot of people's um businesses and

938
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
actually your local yardstore was

939
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
probably already struggling

940
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,519
as a bonus your local yard should store

941
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,159
will have

942
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,000
literal experts there willing to come

943
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and help you with your projects because

944
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,279
they desperately want more people to be

945
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,640
interested in knitting

946
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,559
and give you an idea of how common they

947
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,720
are this is a very zoomed out

948
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,039
very easy that picture of the uk um but

949
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,640
you can probably find one within an hour

950
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
of where you live usually

951
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,760
if you're outside of a major city this

952
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,519
is a bit harder

953
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,679
but you'd be surprised like one thing i

954
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,120
love doing is whenever i go abroad i

955
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,799
always go visit that local yarn shop

956
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,320
and i've been abroad a few times and

957
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,840
i've managed to find local yarn shops

958
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,320
most time

959
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
so with that in mind how much does it

960
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,559
cost to get started with knitting

961
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,000
12 if you'd like to

962
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
anyway um but that is like

963
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,279
i just wanted to show that as much as

964
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,440
i'm saying i just had to you know

965
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
start doing bug bounty hunting in order

966
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,720
to pay for yarn

967
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,399
for most people it's not actually that

968
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,039
expensive i have expensive taste but you

969
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,480
certainly don't have to start out with

970
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,760
paying for like

971
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,919
20 pound balls of yarn and buying enough

972
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,000
to make a jumper when you're like an xl

973
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,799
size

974
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,799
like it is very much that you can start

975
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,159
out with

976
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,000
just the basics and then upgrade if you

977
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,080
find you actually like it

978
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,279
now the anatomy of a sock so socks this

979
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,799
is a pair of socks that i made

980
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,120
um and i think it's kind of nice because

981
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
it shows the anatomy of a sock

982
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,399
so with the method i'm going to be

983
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,120
showing because i'm literally live demo

984
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
um i'm not getting an entire suck that

985
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
takes a long time

986
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,919
part of the reason why it's lucky is

987
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,600
because you put so many hours of work

988
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,399
into it

989
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,039
much like bug bounty hunting um so we

990
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,960
start at the toe

991
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,679
and then we knit a tube until we get to

992
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,559
the heel

993
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
and then we knit another tube until we

994
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,720
get to the cuff very straightforward the

995
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,360
majority of the hard part in socks

996
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,080
by just uh giving myself a little laser

997
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
pointer here

998
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,279
the heel is the hardest part of making a

999
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,480
sock because

1000
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,120
problem is a heel is a toe but in the

1001
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
middle of a sock and on the wrong

1002
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
wrong kind of side when you're knitting

1003
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
it so the heel is the hardest part

1004
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
now the nice thing about sock knitting

1005
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
is that you can kind of mix and match so

1006
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,360
you can start out with your heel

1007
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
or so you start with your toe and if you

1008
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,919
have like a large toe or a small toe

1009
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,320
you can adjust for that if you go to a

1010
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,760
heel and find that heel doesn't quite

1011
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
fit you very well my partner has size

1012
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,399
13 feet um

1013
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,559
he has a huge heel and this method does

1014
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,679
not work for his feet

1015
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,960
but it's fine because all i do is

1016
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,720
replace it with a different method of

1017
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
knitting a heel

1018
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,120
and then the tubes is just as long as

1019
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,800
you want to make them

1020
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
like if you want if you have long feet

1021
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
you just make it as long as you need

1022
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,560
right

1023
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
like one of the main advantages of

1024
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
knitting especially if you live

1025
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,480
outside of like the norms in terms of

1026
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,359
foot size

1027
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,359
you just make it whatever size works for

1028
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,440
you and then we have the cuff at the top

1029
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,159
and for the most part from like this

1030
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,800
point

1031
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
it's plain sailing majority of knitting

1032
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,399
for a sock is knitting

1033
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,760
um a giant tube right let me give you

1034
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,079
some

1035
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,000
numbers because there's anything

1036
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
knitters love more it's maths

1037
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
um here are some numbers to start with

1038
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,918
if you want to get started with sock

1039
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,440
knitting um

1040
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
my recommendation is to knit an adult

1041
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
medium uh

1042
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,719
even for my partner's size 13 feet um a

1043
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,000
medium fits in fine and

1044
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,280
for me a medium fits me fine so

1045
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
i don't know what that kind of sorcery

1046
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,960
is but knitting stretches more

1047
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,359
um lengthways than it does up and down

1048
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,480
next step is to make a fake foot so

1049
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
you to make a fake foot you draw around

1050
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
your foot and cut it out

1051
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
and you'll use that to check the size

1052
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,160
one thing i do is whenever i knit for

1053
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,720
people

1054
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,160
i ask hey can i take can i take a fake

1055
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
foot

1056
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,359
sounds really weird is really weird uh

1057
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,119
it's not as hard as it seems and what

1058
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
you do is just periodically as you make

1059
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,320
the socks you just check

1060
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,680
okay right slide over let the knitting

1061
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
begin

1062
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,320
okay so i'm gonna try i by the way i

1063
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
have not properly

1064
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,200
like i have not properly tested this but

1065
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
hopefully

1066
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
okay right when we're knitting

1067
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,119
okay so apologies it's my phd thesis in

1068
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,079
the uh

1069
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,400
top of the screen there to cast on with

1070
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
knitting you get your ridiculously long

1071
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
needles

1072
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
like the the cable is pretty long and

1073
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,960
you have

1074
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
two needles like this and you hold them

1075
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,200
like that all you need to do is you hold

1076
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
the yarn

1077
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
like this so you kind of see how i'm

1078
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,119
holding it i'm holding it like a y

1079
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,960
shape um and all you do is you place

1080
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,880
your first needle

1081
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
like this so slip that on

1082
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,800
twist it at the bottom put it on that

1083
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,680
one

1084
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,119
hold it there with one finger like that

1085
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,000
and twist it again

1086
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,280
twist it and

1087
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,800
twist it and twist it

1088
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
and twist it and this is basically how

1089
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
you start and what this does it means at

1090
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
the very top

1091
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
these two like areas are very much

1092
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,240
connected

1093
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
and like that is the very tip of your of

1094
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
your sock

1095
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,359
so you cast on how many stitches you

1096
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,760
need according to the stitch numbers

1097
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,119
and you make sure the same amount of

1098
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,680
stitches on both needles

1099
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,440
so now you just hold it like this so

1100
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
make sure it doesn't fall off pull out

1101
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,359
this needle like so

1102
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,000
and now you're ready to start knitting

1103
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
so for the first thing we knit through

1104
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,359
the back loop

1105
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,480
so i'm really sorry i should have

1106
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,160
probably got chunky yarn for this but we

1107
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,720
knit

1108
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,079
like this hold our

1109
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,760
yarn wrap it around

1110
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,720
pull this knitting needle out and let

1111
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
that stitch off the needle

1112
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,079
so go in through the back

1113
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,280
wrap it around

1114
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
and then just catch it like this so what

1115
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,839
i've done is i've kind of caught

1116
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,760
the um the yarn with my hand

1117
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
and this looks like i'm doing wizardry

1118
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
right now and i know it looks like i'm

1119
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,320
doing wizardry

1120
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,480
um because i just remember seeing people

1121
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,880
knit for the first time and thinking wow

1122
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,000
you're magic um but actually it just

1123
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,160
takes practice and it goes into your

1124
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,440
working memory like

1125
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,760
like just sorry your muscle memory super

1126
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,560
quickly

1127
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
now once we're done all we do is we put

1128
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,839
this

1129
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
the all the stitches back by pulling on

1130
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,119
the cable to get them back on the

1131
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,599
needles

1132
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,160
like so and

1133
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,280
then so we're in this position we take

1134
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
this one here

1135
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,480
and we go back in again

1136
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
and then like so so we carry on going

1137
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,240
all the way and one thing to note is

1138
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,400
that i'm using metal needles here

1139
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
um metal needles are very slippery

1140
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
because i have good control over the

1141
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,480
stitches

1142
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,839
don't start with metal needles they're

1143
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,240
really hard to use to start with so go

1144
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,280
into that

1145
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,000
and again out and as you can see

1146
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
we now have our very first little row of

1147
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
stitches sorry the focusing

1148
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,839
webcam is not great but we have like a

1149
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,119
little row of stitches

1150
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,520
and then we just keep doing that until

1151
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,240
we have

1152
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,280
the sock right well i did say there's

1153
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,480
have to be some shaping here

1154
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,839
so i'm gonna put the full slides

1155
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,119
up available on um probably on twitter

1156
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,480
so people can see so i've actually got

1157
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,839
an entire pattern

1158
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,440
um if you'd like the easy way to get

1159
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,560
started with sock knitting

1160
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
well you have to have just have my hands

1161
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
um

1162
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,520
so we cast on using this particular

1163
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,160
technique

1164
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,839
and let me tell you i learned knitting

1165
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,599
completely um

1166
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,920
using youtube videos they are amazing at

1167
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,280
getting started with knitting

1168
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
like 100 youtube knitting teachers have

1169
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
saved my entire life um

1170
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,560
so we cast on the number of stitches we

1171
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
add a stitch mark as we know we're

1172
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
starting

1173
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
and then we knit a toe now this is the

1174
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
pattern for a toe

1175
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
but essentially what we make is like a

1176
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,880
wedge shape and we keep on increasing

1177
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
until we have the number of stitches we

1178
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,359
want

1179
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,960
and how do we know we've got the correct

1180
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,280
number of stitches well

1181
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,319
we put it around our fake foot and that

1182
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,280
sock knitting

1183
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,880
is just put it on your fake foot um

1184
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,480
and then after we've kind of done our

1185
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,960
toe and it fits and it fits over it

1186
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,520
snug is okay with knitting because um it

1187
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
will stretch more lengthways

1188
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,680
so

1189
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,960
so here is another piece of knitting

1190
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
this is a baby jumper by the way

1191
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,560
very cute um so knitting doesn't stretch

1192
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,520
very well in this

1193
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,240
direction but stretches a turn in this

1194
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,440
direction right

1195
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,640
like knitting will stretch a lot

1196
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
of this yarn i got this i actually made

1197
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
a blank out of this yarn

1198
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,280
so i've quite a lot left over um so you

1199
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,839
repeat

1200
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,960
like you can make it whatever size um

1201
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,280
so you can repeat row two and three so

1202
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
just increase it

1203
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
and then make it a little bit bigger if

1204
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,720
you're worried about sizing just keep on

1205
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,079
checking it that is the point of the

1206
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,839
fake foot you just keep on checking it

1207
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,280
and then when it works

1208
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
you know you've reached the right

1209
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,839
correct size and then you get a tube

1210
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,160
yep that's it you knit a big long tube

1211
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
until you're happy with it

1212
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,040
this takes a while this can take like

1213
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,960
a good few days like over a week to net

1214
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
a big long tube

1215
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,200
it's great sitting in front of the

1216
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,640
television though like you sit in front

1217
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
of the tv with your knitting

1218
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,079
you just sit and chill or for me i sit

1219
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
in front of

1220
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
like youtube and sit and knit

1221
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
i spend a lot of my time like listening

1222
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,319
to conferences like i was

1223
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,440
making the baby jumper um before i got

1224
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,880
started and before i was invited into

1225
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,280
the green room so

1226
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,319
um it takes a while and then you know

1227
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
you just keep on checking it and once

1228
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,640
you get to

1229
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,960
the heel of your fake foot that's when

1230
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,760
you've got

1231
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,680
to the correct number of like the

1232
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,800
correct length

1233
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,720
and you knit a heel and the heel is the

1234
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,800
hardest part now there is a great

1235
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,839
heel called uh fish lips kiss but the

1236
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,839
theory is you make a sock

1237
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,079
in the middle of a like you make a toe

1238
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,440
in the middle of your sock and that is

1239
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,079
what a heel

1240
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,160
is like a heel is nothing more than that

1241
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,079
um and you basically this is kind of

1242
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,200
confusing

1243
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,760
um but you essentially knit one less

1244
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,280
stitch each line which creates kind of

1245
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,079
diagonal

1246
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,760
and then you knit one more stitch which

1247
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,520
creates the opposite diagonal

1248
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
and then when you put that together and

1249
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,319
fold it up because this is

1250
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,200
two-dimensional this is a

1251
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,960
three-dimensional piece

1252
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,880
it turns into a heel and magic

1253
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,160
um but then you go back

1254
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,440
to the tube and again the tube

1255
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,160
takes a long time and you knit for when

1256
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,119
you're happy

1257
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,800
i knit when i reach about the same

1258
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
length as my foot

1259
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,040
that's my kind of gauge and then you

1260
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,079
make a cuff

1261
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,000
so that is a knit warm pearl one

1262
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,640
and it makes a stretchy piece of fabric

1263
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,319
it looks like this

1264
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,640
makes like a like nice stretch for the

1265
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
top

1266
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
and finally um this is what socrates

1267
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
will turn you into because you will only

1268
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,520
make one

1269
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,680
the second hardest part of making a sock

1270
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,880
is making

1271
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,680
two of them um thank you very much for

1272
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
listening to me

1273
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,400
enjoy the rest conference i'll happily

1274
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,000
take any questions

1275
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,599
yeah we have some questions for you so

1276
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,280
let me start out with some bug donkey

1277
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,720
questions so first

1278
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
first of all ark asks um i also get

1279
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,319
questions about training from in people

1280
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,920
who are interested in

1281
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,000
bug bounty hunting asking about hack the

1282
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
box and like

1283
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,040
i tell them about bounties in the

1284
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
community and

1285
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,359
there's more incentive to learn am i

1286
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,280
making a mistake in suggesting the hack

1287
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,160
the box route

1288
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,040
as a way to train people to do bug

1289
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,440
bounty hunting

1290
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,119
um no i don't think so like bug bounty

1291
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,520
is never as simple as like

1292
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,920
the one solution that will find you bugs

1293
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,520
and the one learning resource that will

1294
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,720
find you bugs

1295
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
so i don't like any relying resource is

1296
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
good and a lot of people don't use blood

1297
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,560
bounces the way to make money they learn

1298
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,119
it

1299
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
because it's one of the few ways you can

1300
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,400
get like

1301
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,280
actual like pen testing experience where

1302
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,599
you're

1303
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,760
like at university like i like i was

1304
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,000
like like a year ago right

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,440
like i didn't have the opportunity to go

1306
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
and get a job in pen testing because

1307
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,040
i was a student i still had the rest of

1308
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
the degree to finish

1309
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
so i don't think as simple as saying

1310
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,839
this is the correct answer this is not

1311
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,040
the correct answer

1312
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,800
i do think people shouldn't pay for it

1313
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
though i think you should stick to free

1314
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,079
resources until you're absolutely sure

1315
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,880
it's what you want to do

1316
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,480
okay great um also

1317
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
somebody asked about knitting uh what

1318
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,640
what knitting meals should they start

1319
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
out with

1320
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,839
um so i would start out with

1321
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,880
bamboo it's very very grippy so the

1322
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
stitches won't fall off the ends which

1323
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,920
is one of the most difficult things to

1324
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,400
do

1325
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
when you first start out is like the

1326
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,079
stitches just tend to slide around

1327
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,760
until you kind of get used to the

1328
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,119
feeling of them

1329
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,480
um you can get what's called bulky yarn

1330
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
and that is like really thick yarn you

1331
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,440
can make like a nice little hat as your

1332
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,240
first project

1333
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,440
so my recommendation is bamboo needles

1334
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,280
but honestly go to your local yarn shop

1335
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
say hi i'd really like to learn how to

1336
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,000
knit

1337
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,920
and you will have people falling over

1338
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
themselves offering to help you because

1339
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,480
we as knitters very much realize that

1340
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,160
knitting is not a very popular hobby

1341
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,960
anymore

1342
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,160
and we love sharing it

1343
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
like we genuinely love talking about

1344
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,160

1346
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,359

1347
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,800

1348
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,880
is crocheting also acceptable and can we

1349
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,680

1350
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,800
you can make socks by crocheting um i

1351
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,960
i can actually crochet as well i have

1352
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,000
crocheted myself in

1353
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,640
a blanket though i am not the the term

1354
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,680
is bistitual

1355
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
if you if you can do both knitting and

1356
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,720
crocheting

1357
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
i'm not quite by stitch wall i can

1358
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,560
crochet and actually use crochet quite a

1359
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,200
lot in

1360
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,920
in knitting like to do the top of my

1361
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,760
little baby jumper the top had to be

1362
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,520
crocheted

1363
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
so uh yes you also can crochet socks

1364
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
uh if you go into ravelry and just look

1365
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
at socks but then change the search to a

1366
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,359
crochet

1367
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,839
it will then tell you how to uh crochet

1368
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:08,560
socks and

1369
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,680
the actual pattern and one final

1370
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,000
question we've got time for now is some

1371
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,599
there's a lot of focus on websites in

1372
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,720
terms of bug bounties for

1373
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
you know just just in general um are

1374
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,480
there also bug bounty programs for

1375
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,440
hardware

1376
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,119
firmware and software that people can

1377
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,119
get involved in

1378
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,440
absolutely i'm talking a lot about

1379
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,760
websites because web is one of the most

1380
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,119
um like accessible ways to get started

1381
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,800
but like there are so many different

1382
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,720
options like tesla's bug brownie program

1383
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,480
is not just limited to its websites it's

1384
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,359
also limited

1385
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,720
it's also includes things like their

1386
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
cars as well um

1387
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,960
but it will completely depend on the on

1388
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,240
the program

1389
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,000
if you like already

1390
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,240
know of a company that does those kind

1391
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,680
of things and you're wondering just take

1392
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,119
out their scope page like they'll have

1393
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,000
it listed

1394
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,640
like apple will pay for um bugs

1395
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,319
retaining to hardware for example as

1396
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,560
well

1397
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,200

1398
