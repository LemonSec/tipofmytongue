1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,199
uh we are moving over to

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,080
talking about linux containers and black

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,640
and white

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,360
analog photography in your bathroom with

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,320
hugo

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
hugo welcome thank you for joining us

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
today i'm really

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,880
grateful for you coming here and sharing

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,359
your hobby and your profession with us

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,760
thank you

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
and i will stop sharing my screen

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
here we go uh so hello everyone my name

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,119
is hugo and i would like to take a

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,320
couple of minutes to talk about

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
containers

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
um today more and more systems are

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
relying on containers

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,320
to deploy and run workloads both for

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,079
local development and production use

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,960
case

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
you've probably heard of docker

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,879
kubernetes french or lxc

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
all of those technologies are relying on

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,239
containers in

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
a given fashion you're likely going to

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,680
audit

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
test and harden an increasing amount of

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
system running containers in the next

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,000
years

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
this is why i think it's important to

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
talk about them what they are and how do

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
they work

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
the more we will understand them the

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
easier it will be to

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
break them and to secure them so during

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
this presentation i'm going to build a

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,119
container definition from a technical

38
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,560
and low level point of view

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
so no prior knowledge should be required

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
who am i my name is go and my current

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
job is helping people to deploy

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
containers in production and manage such

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,400
contenderized systems for

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
a big video game company even today

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,159
if i'm more on development and

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,520
infrastructure side

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
i also have a infosec background through

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
my study and

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
at some point i'd even worked a bit as a

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
tester

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
to describe how container works i'm

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,840
going to do a silly analogy and compare

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,119
everything with batman

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
this might sounds weird but bear with me

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
it will eventually make sense

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
most of you have heard about batman it's

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
the story of bruce wayne

58
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
billionaire by day and vigilante known

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
as the batman by knight

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,040
bruce has a huge manner he lives in and

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,880
he is held with

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,080
his butler named alfred

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
bruce spends a lot of time doing his

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
vigilante hobby

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
and in fact the one doing almost

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,200
everything in the manure is

67
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
alfred alfred provides bruce everything

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,239
he needs

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,120
while making sure the manure stays clean

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
and tidy

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
without him everything would likely fall

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
into pieces shortly

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
let's say bruce wants to decorate the

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
dining room with a specific piece of

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
orcs he's not going to buy and go get

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,120
the painting himself instead he will ask

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,680
alfred

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
and the next day when he will come back

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
he'll find the painting hanged in the

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,959
dining room

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,000
so here we have a pattern in the manual

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
bruce is asking and alfred is doing

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,120
in fact that's really close to what

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
happened in computers

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
for example when the process wants to

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
read the file it's going to ask

87
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
something called the operating system

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
the operating system here linux is going

89
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,280
to look

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
on which physical drive the file is

91
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
located it will then go find the file

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
load its content to memory and once the

93
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
content will be loaded

94
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,400
it's going to get back to the process

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
and say hey i loaded the content of your

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,959
file

97
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,480
it's in this space in the memory and you

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
can access it now

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
then the process will be happy and able

100
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,800
to enjoy the fight's content

101
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
so the operating system is to the

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,239
process that

103
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
alfred is to blue swain it's someone

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
doing all the low level and heavy

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,159
lifting so the other one is able to

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,120
focus some

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
high level and more important stuff

108
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,200
it's also here to ensure and stability

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
and make sure requests are sound and

110
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,640
not compromising the whole system for

111
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,280
processes

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
asking the operating system to do

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
something as a name

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,239
this is a system call or cisco for short

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
and there are a lot of different ciscos

116
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,280
last time i checked

117
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
writing this presentation i found 332

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,000
different linux system calls

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
when running on x 86 architecture likely

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,040
what you got on your computer

121
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
if you don't have the latest macbooks

122
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,799
processes are doing

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
a system cultural check with absolutely

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,239
everything to get an

125
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,920
idea of how important this is for

126
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
example a process wants to know what

127
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
time is it

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
what's its machine name what is his

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
process id he wants to talk with someone

130
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
another network

131
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
he wants to communicate with another

132
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
process or he if the process even

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,840
wants to fork and have a child process

134
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
it will

135
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
do a system call and ask the operating

136
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
system

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
so system calls are everywhere you can

138
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
find most of them online just

139
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
google linux system calls table and you

140
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
will find all of them

141
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,720
the batman analogy is not over yet so

142
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
now let's say bruce wayne wants to throw

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
a big party in his manual and

144
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
because there's no curving in batman's

145
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
world there will be a lot of guests

146
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
and guests will do as bruce does they

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
will ask alfred if they need anything

148
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
for example they will ask to get some

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
new glas to get a new glass of wine

150
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
or they can ask questions about the host

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
bruce or the manure itself

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
and here we have a problem they should

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
not know bruce is into bad cosplaying

154
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
nor that he spends whole this whole

155
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,199
fortune developing tech

156
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
to do three top adventure course in the

157
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
middle of the city

158
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
alfred cannot really say no you are not

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,039
allowed to have this information because

160
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
it's going to sound suspect and people

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
will start asking more questions

162
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
so there is only one way out alfred will

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
have to lie

164
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
the issue with lies is that when you

165
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
start lying you cannot really stop you

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
have to rely on more and more subjects

167
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,560
for example someone can say do you know

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
who is batman

169
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
and the obvious answer should be no but

170
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,039
you're gonna have more intimate

171
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,919
questions

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,120
even not in international you can need

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
more information about bruce true

174
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
identity

175
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
for example how many rooms are there in

176
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
the manner

177
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,600
should our thread counts the rooms in

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
the secret caves which are filled with

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
weapons and wear tech

180
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
or not and another question how high

181
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
is your electricity bill to enter this

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
alfred will have to keep track and

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
deduct the power consumed of

184
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
by of each machine and the depends uh

185
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
the power consumed by

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
whatever batman machine has

187
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,280
and on modern linux kennel we can also

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
ask the operating system to lie to the

189
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,680
process

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
exactly the same way alfred lies to the

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
guests

192
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
when the process will do a system call

193
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
lindex will remember that someone asked

194
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
it to lie

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,919
to the process and we'll answer the lie

196
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,440
instead of the truth

197
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
so for example we can ask linux can you

198
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
tell it that there are no files here

199
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
or can you tell this process that i'm

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,199
not here

201
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
please make it believe that you are this

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
processive route

203
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
or even i don't want this process to

204
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
know i have a second network interface

205
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
which is able to reach internet i only

206
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,560
want this process to have access to

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
this network interface which has access

208
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
to the local network

209
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
and linux will start to lie and i will

210
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,280
have to

211
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
keep track of all the lies um it told to

212
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,840
know

213
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
which layer was sold to whom because for

214
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
example if a process a

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,440
as a child b linux should tell the the b

216
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
the same lies little a because if it

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,639
does not uh a

218
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,960
and b will start to understand that

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,919
something is wrong and

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,280
won't behave correctly to make it easier

221
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,000
to know

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,759
who should be answered what we are going

223
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
to introduce a lie group

224
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,599
everyone in this group will be lied the

225
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
same thing if a process

226
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
in this group has a child the child will

227
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
automatically be part of this group

228
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
and the group will be destroyed as soon

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
as there are no process left in it

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
because there is no um it's not useful

231
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,199
to keep track of all the lies we told if

232
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
everyone who heard it uh or dead and

233
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,960
destroyed

234
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,400
so a live group is a non-technical term

235
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,120
like it's a

236
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
something i made up um in the real world

237
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
we call

238
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
those groups name spaces

239
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
and today there are eight different kind

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
of namespaces supported by linux

241
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
i won't describe them all because it

242
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
would it would be boring

243
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,639
and it i would just provide a poorer

244
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,400
version of what you can already find on

245
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,680
the internet

246
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
but basically you can lie about

247
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
absolutely anything you can buy about

248
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
uh lie about the network the files the

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
process the users the time

250
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,639
the us the earth name you can lie about

251
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,760
a lot of stuff but

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,839
the batman analogy is not over yet

253
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,919
you might know that batman has a

254
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
sidekick which is called robin and in

255
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
fact

256
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,920
batman had multiple robins each time a

257
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
robin stops

258
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
being robin because he wants to do

259
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
something else or dies that matter will

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
enroll a new young people to help him

261
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
with his activity and this person will

262
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
become the new robin

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,200
these people know who batman is but they

264
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
don't have full access to the manual

265
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
resource

266
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
for example they cannot ask alfred hey i

267
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,040
want to

268
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
buy i want to buy everything

269
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
i want to buy tesla for example and i

270
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
want to use all batman's fortune

271
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
they they have the information but they

272
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,640
cannot

273
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
consume everything and

274
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,399
this pattern will also have it in the

275
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,519
linux world

276
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,360
we want to be sure that no one is

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
exhausting all the resource

278
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
uh we don't have a manual we have a

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,080
machine

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,800
and this machine has a given amount of

281
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
resources and we don't want

282
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
the any process to consume them all so

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
we are going to introduce something

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
called a control group and this time

285
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
it's not a term that i made up it's a

286
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
real technical term

287
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,040
and this does exactly what its name says

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
it control processes which are in this

289
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
group

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
limitations will apply to the whole

291
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
group this means

292
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
if you create a c control group a c

293
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,120
group

294
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
to limit the memory to four gigabytes

295
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
the sum of all the processes

296
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
in the group will not be able to go over

297
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,160
4 gigabytes

298
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
if any process would request a memory

299
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
education that would break this rule

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
this will result in waking the out of

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,800
memory killer

302
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
and someone will get killed to free more

303
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
memory

304
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,800
as full name spaces there are a lot of

305
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
different c groups um

306
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
and there is a twist c groups were

307
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
implemented in two versions

308
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
versions one and version two you can

309
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,440
find a lot of

310
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
extensive documentation on the internet

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,839
about this

312
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
with everything we've seen so far we can

313
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
imagine a way to

314
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,320
start a process and make it believe that

315
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,920
it's the only one and it's on its

316
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
machine

317
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
and give it a false network interface

318
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
its own little disk

319
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
and restrict it access to the to only a

320
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,640
part of

321
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
the machine resource and in this case we

322
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
would call

323
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
this this process a container

324
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,399
so we start by creating its file system

325
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
it's basically a directory containing

326
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
everything you would find

327
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
on a usual linux distribution so slash

328
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,839
bin slash user slash

329
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
atc slash leave and so on if you

330
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
take all those files and put them

331
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
together into a single archive

332
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,160
archive this is called an image and

333
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
that's exactly what you're putting when

334
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
you do a docker pool

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
and give an image name you're basically

336
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
putting a new file system that will be

337
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
used

338
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
as the container file system

339
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,240
then we are going to fork and create the

340
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,279
child process

341
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,640
and put all child process into a new

342
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
name spaces and especially in space

343
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,600
restricting

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,240
uh it's just it's access to the file

345
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
system

346
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
and tell it that there is only this file

347
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
system existing

348
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
uh and pointed to the image then we are

349
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,560
going to create c

350
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,200
groups to limit our child memory or alt

351
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
cpu conception

352
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
and we are going to create two virtual

353
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
network interface

354
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
and link them together we'll put one

355
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
in our child network name space and one

356
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
in ours

357
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
and through this interface we'll be able

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
to discuss with the with our child

359
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
and our child will only see this

360
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
interface so it will talk to us

361
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
uh using this interface and we are going

362
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,760
to forward the traffic

363
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
to the outside world and when we'll have

364
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
response for example

365
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
if it does http gets we are going to

366
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
have the response

367
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
and set it back to the process so we

368
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
will control

369
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
all the traffic going in and out of the

370
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
of the container

371
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
if you're used to linux system

372
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,839
administration

373
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
it's basically using ip tables and

374
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
implementing

375
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200
a nat using ap tables exactly as you

376
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
would do on

377
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
any any corporate network

378
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,519
then everything is ready to start our

379
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,279
containerized process so

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,440
we ask our chill child living in the

381
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,279
namespace to transform itself

382
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,200
into the process we want to run so for

383
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
example i want to run an

384
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
nginx hdb server so i will ask my

385
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,399
process

386
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,360
hey can you morph into a nginx http

387
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,320
server

388
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
and there is a linux system called for

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
that which is called exec ve

390
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
and will you allow any process to

391
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
turn it turn itself into another process

392
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,279
so

393
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
the your child will go will ask linux to

394
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,639
hey

395
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
i want to become nginx and linux will

396
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,639
kill your child and

397
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,680
start nginx instead

398
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,240
once done there will be no trust left of

399
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,279
our child and

400
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,360
we'll have a process running it's in in

401
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
its own namespace with its own file

402
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,160
system

403
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
and its only way to communicate with the

404
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
outside world would be through

405
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
the network interface with mnh and we'll

406
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
have a container

407
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,000
now we finally have a technical

408
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
definition of what a container is

409
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,839
but what does it mean from a security

410
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,920
point of view

411
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
first it means if you're bruce wayne you

412
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,199
can see everything happening

413
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,760
inside the containers you can fire h

414
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,320
stop and

415
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
see all the process running it's the

416
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
opposite of a virtual machine like you

417
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
will be able to see

418
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
this process is running have this child

419
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,839
and is running in this name space

420
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
and has this as those can access build

421
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
resources for example

422
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
so basically when your routes and

423
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
on the host you can see everything

424
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,240
you can enter them spaces that's really

425
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
useful to debug

426
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,680
or to perform lateral movements you can

427
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
ask linux to

428
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
open a new shell and say i want to view

429
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,440
things

430
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
as this container sees and you will have

431
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
pop and you shall and this shell will be

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
restricted all the name spaces and c

433
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
groups so you'll be able to understand

434
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,279
what

435
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
the container contain the rice processes

436
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
if you're in a container and privilege

437
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
privilege enough you can even

438
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
ask linux to get out of your namespace

439
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
and get back to the original namespace

440
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,079
and that would mean uh getting out of

441
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,360
the container and that's

442
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
the thing we want to avoid and there is

443
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,600
a last uh thing which is uh

444
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
a bit difficult but we are lying to the

445
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
process and making it believe

446
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
it is roots for example and if we are

447
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,240
doing that

448
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
we'll have to follow the rules of a root

449
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,519
user this means

450
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
if we are going to give access to a

451
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,760
resource to the process

452
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
and the process wants to do something it

453
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,240
will do something as roots even if

454
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
from the host's point of view it is not

455
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
root which is running its

456
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
user 182 for example when the process

457
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,839
will for example

458
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
try to write something on a disk it will

459
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
write as roots because from its point of

460
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,160
view it is root and

461
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
linux will act as act

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,920
as if the process will root so this

463
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,199
means if you give

464
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,959
access to a resource to a container and

465
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
this and something in this container is

466
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,199
running as

467
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,399
the root user it will be able to perform

468
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,360
any action at

469
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,079
as it would been a have been able to do

470
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
as a root user on the host so

471
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,599
this might be a security risk

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
to conclude this introduction to linux

473
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,120
container i will

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
uh cite uh elijah's gold first who

475
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,240
perfectly

476
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
perfectly summed up everything in a

477
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
single sentence

478
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
containers are processes born from toe

479
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,040
balls

480
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,240
turbos or the image and name space

481
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
and control by c groups and with this

482
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
you have

483
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
you should have a definition of what a

484
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
container is and how this works

485
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,839
if you want to go further you have two

486
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,600
linux cli tools you can

487
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
use one which is called

488
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
ns enter which allows you to enter any

489
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
namespace

490
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,839
and the other one which is called

491
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,519
unshare which

492
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,880
allows you to create a child and

493
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
put the child into your namespace

494
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,519
already existing one or create a new one

495
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
if you want to toy with everything i

496
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
said i built up

497
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,199
a small getting started to

498
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,440
create a container using only bash and

499
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,679
linux primitive so

500
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
here is the link and i will post it in

501
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,319
the slack chat after

502
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
and thank you very much that's the end

503
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,000
of

504
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,839
this part of the presentation

505
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,599
and i'm going to i think if we have time

506
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,319
we're going to

507
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,559
take the questions after so i'm going to

508
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,720
move to the second part

509
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,679
uh just now which is black and white

510
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
analog photograph in your bathroom

511
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
i started eight years ago by taking my

512
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
diets all camera and

513
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
buying films at the nearest store and at

514
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,799
that point i had no idea how to take

515
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,440
photos

516
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
know how to transform the film into a

517
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,799
printed photo

518
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,960
i was just buying the local photoshop

519
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
and giving them the film and

520
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
i got back one week later with the film

521
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
and the negatives and the usb key

522
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
with all the scan photos then a friend

523
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
started to develop his photo himself

524
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,600
and i gave it a try and it ended up

525
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
being as interesting as taking the photo

526
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,440
so during the next 10 minutes we'll talk

527
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
about developing black and white films

528
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
at home in your bathroom why would you

529
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
want to develop your own photos

530
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
first of all it's some it's a really

531
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
nice do-it-yourself hobby it has a lot

532
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
of technique you can learn and improve

533
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,080
so

534
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
you always always have this feeling of i

535
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,400
learned something new or i'm getting

536
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
better at it

537
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
and it's something which is really

538
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
rewarding and by comparison

539
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
with the digital photography you don't

540
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,880
have any

541
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
instant on or free feedback you have to

542
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
wait and put some effort in order to

543
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
convert that piece of film

544
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
into something meaningful that can be

545
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,160
shown to people which is

546
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,039
the final photo and the delay between

547
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,160
when you take the photo

548
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
and when you can finally see it

549
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,679
contributes a lot to the

550
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,000
reward feeling you get so by waiting

551
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
that's kind of well but by waiting one

552
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,600
week you have

553
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,559
you're way more rewarded than if you had

554
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
the photo instantly on your screen and

555
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
have been able to post it on facebook

556
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
it might sound weird but analog

557
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,260
photography is kind of cheap compared to

558
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,679
[Music]

559
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,640
whatever cost a decent digital camera

560
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
today

561
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
um yes you will have to buy 100

562
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
of chemicals and pay for the films but

563
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,919
with it you should be able to take about

564
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,640
500 pics so if you're not uh

565
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
taking a lot of photos this will likely

566
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,080
cost

567
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,559
less than buying a full featured digital

568
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
camera

569
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,799
the last benefit is the cultural aspect

570
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,919
of taking photos

571
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
and the talk just before talked about

572
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,760
having a hobby and an artistic

573
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
one and it kind of goes

574
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,559
in the same way because photo is

575
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,640
both a technique and an art by studying

576
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,679
the technique you end up

577
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
extending with exchanging with people

578
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,799
with an

579
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
artistic background and that's something

580
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
really interesting when you're coming

581
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,799
from

582
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,919
from a technical background and

583
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,000
working with computers all the day that

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
really gets you out of

585
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,720
uh your bubble and allow you to do and

586
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,000
try

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
more creative stuff and discuss with

588
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
more creative people

589
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
analog photography is a four-step

590
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
process

591
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,799
basically we take the picture that the

592
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,000
fun parts every

593
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
everyone already knows about then we

594
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,679
develop the film

595
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,840
this is the process of getting from the

596
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
film uh

597
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
in its battery case into um

598
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,600
something that won't get destroyed by

599
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,440
light or time that will be called

600
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
negative by looking at negative we can

601
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,200
choose

602
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
the best photo uh this can take a lot of

603
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,840
time because we have a lot of photos and

604
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
those are really small and when we

605
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
finally decide which one is best

606
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,039
we can print them either by scanning the

607
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,679
negative

608
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,919
or using um or using a more classical

609
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
way of printing photo

610
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
i will get back to it later

611
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,960
the first half of the steps can be done

612
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,000
easily without too much

613
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,320
equipment that's the part i will focus

614
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,120
on as

615
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,200
in my experience it's the easiest way to

616
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
get started with

617
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,559
analog photography to take the photo you

618
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,360
need

619
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,080
a camera it costs around one of the laws

620
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,880
today

621
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
black and white film uh and a way to

622
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,640
measure light

623
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,640
if your camera does not have it um

624
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
if you don't have a way to measure light

625
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
in your camera you can

626
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
use a phone app for this or buy a light

627
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
meter

628
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,679
the camera is composed of a length an

629
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
obturator and a film

630
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
the lens is taking all the light coming

631
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
from the object you want to take

632
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
a photo and uh

633
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
redirecting it to the film and the

634
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
observatory is here to block the lights

635
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
from hitting the film enough to avoid

636
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,400
burning the film

637
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
when you press the trigger the

638
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
observatory opens and close

639
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
and it lets a small quantity of light

640
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,280
hit the film

641
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
at this point there is an image on the

642
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
film composed and

643
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,679
composed of microscopic black dots these

644
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,960
dots are so small

645
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
even the most powerful microscope would

646
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
not see them

647
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
if we had a steady subject we could keep

648
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,280
the obturator open for several hours and

649
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,919
the paper would slowly turn dark and we

650
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
will start to see the image but

651
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,600
as you might have guessed it's not

652
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
really practical to ask someone to say

653
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
uh to do not move during two hours in

654
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
order to take a single photo so

655
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
we have to get another way of uh making

656
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,760
this

657
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
picture visible and hopefully we are

658
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,880
going to

659
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
do it using chemistry

660
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,200
these parts uh making the photo visible

661
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
is called development and it's a

662
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
multi-step process

663
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,039
the goal is to go from a film in its

664
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,080
metallic

665
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,120
metal role with an image we cannot see

666
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,159
and which is still light sensitive to a

667
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,840
film with a visible image

668
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
not reacting to like anymore and that

669
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
will not be destroyed by the time

670
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,679
and we call this results a negative

671
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
we have to move the film from its

672
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,320
plastic case into a light proof tank

673
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
uh where we'll be able to pour the

674
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,520
chemicals in the issue is

675
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,960
uh the lights burn the film so even

676
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,039
the red lights you see in the movies uh

677
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,039
will burn the film and

678
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,520
you won't be able to see anything if the

679
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
film sees light

680
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
so this whole process should be made in

681
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,679
the solar security in your darkest room

682
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,919
without any windows by nights likely in

683
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,159
your bathroom or like in the

684
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,480
in the room with the less light you have

685
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,360
in your room

686
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,559
in your house once you're in the dark

687
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,679
you have to pull

688
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
the film out of the case and start

689
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
rolling it into a real

690
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,559
the release a thing that avoids your

691
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
film to touch

692
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,120
to touch any border in the tank uh to

693
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,760
ensure that

694
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,039
when you will pour the chemical the

695
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
chemical will be in contact with

696
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
all the film surface and there will no

697
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
be uh there will

698
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
be no spot where there will no b

699
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,880
chemicals on it

700
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
that's a really tedious operation you

701
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,320
will have to put the film in

702
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,120
and start reading the biggest risk is

703
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
the film to twist and not slide properly

704
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
um when it's over you cut the end of the

705
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,039
film

706
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,240
put the reel into the tank and

707
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,120
close the tank silits and then you can

708
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
turn light on and the other spot is over

709
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
then we can grab our most beautiful lab

710
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,520
coats and start the chemistry boards

711
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,000
the first thing we want to do is to make

712
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
the image appear on the film

713
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
so for this we'll use the chemical

714
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,799
called the developer

715
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
it will make the film turn black but it

716
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
will react first on parts already hit by

717
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,919
lights

718
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,720
so it will widen those microscopic dots

719
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,559
we had before

720
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,799
this means the more we let it react

721
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,360
the wider the dots will be and the

722
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,960
darker it will get

723
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
so if we wait too much we will end up

724
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
with a completely black film

725
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
and if we don't wait enough we'll have a

726
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
transparent

727
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
one without any contrast and we won't

728
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
have any picture on it

729
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,039
so the result depends on which chemical

730
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,840
is used

731
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,559
how much time do we wait uh which film

732
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
was used

733
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,559
the temperature and if we are shaking

734
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,159
the tank or not during

735
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,279
the process the community is

736
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
sharing a lot of receipts online and

737
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,559
most of the time

738
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
i just end up googling which film i have

739
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
which developer i have

740
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
and i will always have dozens of recipes

741
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
recipes and with a picture of

742
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,000
the kind of results i can expect and i

743
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,039
will choose one and

744
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,039
apply when the reaction is over

745
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,200
uh and the film is revealed enough we

746
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
have to stop the reaction if we don't

747
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
the film will continue to darken and

748
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
there this can be done by either rinsing

749
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,080
with cold water or

750
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
using something which is called a stub

751
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,760
bath basically just vinegar

752
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
so we put cold weather all the stuff

753
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
bath so it's completely stops the

754
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
reaction and at this point

755
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,159
we have a film with an image on it and

756
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,200
we might want to

757
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
put it out of the tank and look at it

758
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,799
which we should never do

759
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,039
because we would not have issues during

760
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,400
the first two or three minutes but at

761
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
some point the film will

762
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,960
turn darker and darker it's because

763
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
the film is still reacting to light the

764
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,320
same way it was reacting

765
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,000
when it was in the camera and we still

766
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,679
have microscopic black dots

767
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,720
appearing uh on the film everywhere and

768
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
after a day uh the film will only be

769
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
black and we would have lost

770
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
any trace of the picture we took so

771
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
to avoid this issue and we need to get

772
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,159
rid of everything that has not reacted

773
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,200
to that yet

774
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
to make sure there is no chemical that

775
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,240
will continue to react

776
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
and for this we are going to use

777
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
something called a fixer

778
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
and the fixer will remove all traces of

779
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
silver from the film

780
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,679
and will make sure that the film will be

781
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,919
able to be exposed to lights without

782
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
turning black again

783
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
there is no receipt for this step you

784
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
basically dilute one quantity of fixer

785
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,279
with four quantities of water

786
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
uh put the put this into the tank wait

787
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
10 minutes

788
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,679
shake a good a good time and get back

789
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
the fixer

790
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,520
because you can reduce you just reuse it

791
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
up to five times

792
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,760
then you have to rinse and you will

793
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
never rinse too much

794
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
uh really don't be impatient usually you

795
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,039
should rinse

796
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,320
during 15 and it can be up to 20 minutes

797
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,279
because if you still have chemicals uh

798
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,320
in the tank

799
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
it will when the film will dry it will

800
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,000
uh dry

801
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,440
on the film and it will you will have

802
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,480
um a taint like it will turn red or

803
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,520
yellow or

804
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,679
it won't look like what you want it to

805
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,080
look like

806
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
when it's been 20 minutes and you're

807
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
sure absolutely all chemicals have been

808
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,279
removed from the tank you can

809
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,640
perform the last pass which is called

810
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,200
the waiting agent it's basically dish

811
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,320
soap and water

812
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
the goal is to avoid whether to stay on

813
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,679
the film when we will hang it

814
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,000
uh to dry because if you still have

815
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,279
water droplets

816
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,600
uh when they will dry they will leave

817
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,480
traces so

818
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,799
you don't want to have water droplets so

819
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,080
we put open it

820
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
and then we put it to dry

821
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,640
um it dries it takes maybe four or five

822
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
hours to dry depending on

823
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,080
where you are and we can get using

824
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
weighted clips

825
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,240
so if i sum up uh the price of

826
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,200
everything that was needed until now is

827
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,840
between

828
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,880
90 and 150 dollars

829
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,559
it should allow you to take between 500

830
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,039
and 800 800 photos

831
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,840
which is can be quite consequent

832
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
and of course i have issues with the

833
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,840
slides

834
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,240
sorry um so

835
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
we want to choose uh which slide where

836
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
are the

837
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
the best ones and for this uh we have to

838
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,039
look at the negatives and as uh

839
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,760
its number indicates the negatives are

840
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
the opposite of what the photo

841
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,000
uh what was seen when we took the photo

842
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,720
so

843
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
if uh we had um

844
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
an object which was black it's going to

845
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,159
be white on the negative

846
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,240
and the opposite so the light

847
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
everything which was light will turn

848
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
dark and every cheese which was dark

849
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,080
will be

850
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
light on the negative so it's really

851
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,200
hard to see

852
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,120
um what what the negative what the final

853
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
photo look like

854
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,039
so at this point you can grab your phone

855
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,080
camera and

856
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,799
take a picture and put it into photoshop

857
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,200
or

858
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
any photo editing tool and

859
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
perform the invert filter which will

860
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,640
basically turn all black into

861
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
white and the opposites and you will

862
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,320
have the photo as it

863
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
would look like in the final product

864
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
you can also bring the the negatives to

865
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,159
your local photoshop

866
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,200
and ask them to scan them they have

867
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,880
high density negative film

868
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,080
scanners and they can give you

869
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,760
digital versions of the photo you took

870
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
a nice way to have all the photos to

871
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,279
know what they will look like

872
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,039
and you will even be able to share with

873
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
the people uh

874
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,720
you were like you can send the photos on

875
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,120
facebook or send them by email to

876
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,320
the people who are in the photos

877
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,000
and then the last step is to print

878
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,279
using a classical printer or

879
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,399
print it in a more traditional way i'm

880
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,240
not going to detail the whole printing

881
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,519
process but

882
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,600
with everything we've done right now

883
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,720
until now

884
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,090
we should have a way to

885
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,760
[Music]

886
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
find a way to get all the colors

887
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,880
inverted again and have a real picture

888
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
we can take a photo of our photo and

889
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,399
because minus n minus uh gives a plus

890
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,240
if we invert everything again we are

891
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,440
going to get back to

892
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
a normal photo and

893
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
this is done by taking a photo of the

894
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,279
photo again so

895
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,240
we use something called an enlarger and

896
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
it's basically

897
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
we have a source of light we put the

898
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,240
film uh

899
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
behind it and the light goes through the

900
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,679
film

901
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,440
and there is a lens and it's going to

902
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
project the photo on a

903
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,080
paper and you're going to print a photo

904
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
on the paper you think

905
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
you're basically taking a photo of your

906
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,840
photo but instead of a film you're going

907
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,480
to use a paper

908
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
then this paper you will do the usual

909
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
steps like you will develop it

910
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,519
then use a fixer then rinse it then use

911
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,440
just a bath

912
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
and this whole printing process requires

913
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,600
way more space and tools

914
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,559
than just developing the photos it can

915
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,000
still be done in your bathroom but

916
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,480
it requires a bigger investment and i

917
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,000
really don't advise

918
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,480
trying to do everything at once um

919
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,159
mastering the development process

920
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
and making your own negatives is already

921
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
a complex first step

922
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,559
and maybe waiting to be familiar with

923
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
everything before trying out

924
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,320
printing your photos is a good idea

925
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
and i think that's all if you're

926
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,000
interested in

927
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,799
in doing this yourself you can find a

928
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,399
great step-by-step guide on

929
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,760
how to do it on insert tables and

930
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,640
if you're going to go if you want to go

931
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
even further

932
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,640
you can make your own developer and

933
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,480
instead of buying chemicals

934
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
you can uh you can use instant coffee

935
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,919
and civitamin

936
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,760
um to make your photo appear and react

937
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,559
and on the plus side you will be able to

938
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
throw everything in the sink

939
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,440
and not pollute um and

940
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
not have to keep

941
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,919
everything in a drawer because it

942
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,159
pollutes

943
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,360
so thank you very much

944
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,880
that's the end of the second

945
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
presentation

946
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
if you don't mind there are some

947
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,640
questions for you yes sure so the first

948
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
one is um

949
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
regarding containers what are the

950
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,039
privileges that a process needs to

951
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,399
escape a container

952
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,360
and have you ever managed to simulate it

953
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,159
uh

954
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,200
you can have you need two things you

955
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
need to be able

956
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,600
to you are you need to run as a root

957
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,519
user in most of the case

958
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,279
to be able to escape that's the first

959
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,960
part so if you're running as a

960
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
non-privileged user

961
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
you will not have the permission to

962
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,080
perform the linux system call to go back

963
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
to the original

964
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,120
namespace and the second thing is

965
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,240
there are things called capabilities

966
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,679
and you have to be able to

967
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,399
uh perform uh certain system calls and

968
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,440
there are

969
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,879
uh for example a lot of syscalls

970
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,520
allowing you to change some space or put

971
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,639
um under uh what is called the

972
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,719
capability and when you're creating

973
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,000
containers you can

974
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,639
tell linux i want this capability to be

975
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,399
available and by default

976
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,760
this is not the case um if you're

977
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,239
running

978
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,800
on docker or on kubernetes with the

979
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
privileged flag

980
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,040
you're explicitly saying linux that you

981
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
want this container to have capabilities

982
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
of doing everything

983
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,679
and for example get out of its own

984
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,879
namespace

985
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,719
and the last thing you will need to get

986
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,079
out of your namespace is

987
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,399
to view uh to be able to view the

988
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,839
original namespace

989
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,639
uh to get out of it uh because you're

990
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,320
not getting out you're entering

991
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
again the namespace you were before

992
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,359
being containerized

993
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,079
and yes it of course it's can be used it

994
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,880
can be done

995
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,160
um and in fact

996
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,320
that's uh what i'm using today if i want

997
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,920
to debug a container

998
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
in production and i have issues on the

999
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,119
hosts

1000
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,040
and i don't have ssh access to the host

1001
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,680
i'm going to run a privileged container

1002
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,480
and

1003
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
i will attach in this container and from

1004
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,760
this container i will

1005
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
go back to the host file system and i

1006
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,240
will it will act as if i had a

1007
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,800
ssh switch connection on the host even

1008
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,400
if in fact i'm just

1009
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
opening a container on the system and

1010
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
getting out of it

1011
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,680
so yeah it's totally feasible to get out

1012
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,119
of a container

1013
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,640
but by default um most of the system

1014
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,839
will do not give you

1015
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,359
the capabilities to do so so we have a

1016
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,640
bit younger audience

1017
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
in in some of these cases who aren't

1018
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
used to film developing and they want to

1019
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,880
know why

1020
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,240
why the red lights okay the red lights

1021
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
um is used on the second part the

1022
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,160
printing port

1023
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,280
um because it would be

1024
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,480
kind of tedious uh to print uh

1025
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
you know you have the paper and you want

1026
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,079
to print on the paper

1027
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,960
and be able to and you want to be able

1028
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,720
to know where the paper is and put it in

1029
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
the next path and

1030
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,800
everything and in this case we use

1031
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
the paper does not react to the this red

1032
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,160
light so

1033
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,280
to avoid being on the dark all the time

1034
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
we use a specific red light that will

1035
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
not burn the paper but

1036
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,200
this is not the case uh for the films

1037
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
the one you have in the camera

1038
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,359
this one reacts also to the red light so

1039
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,359
they would be burnt by this light

1040
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,000
but when you're using paper the paper is

1041
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
not burned by the red light so

1042
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,160
it allows you to do everything as it as

1043
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,599
if you would be in the dark

1044
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,000
but in fact you can or you can always

1045
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,480
see something

1046
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,320
and the next question is do you have a

1047
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,160
favorite 35 millimeter film

1048
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
that you use today i love the

1049
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,680
kodak 3x uh the original they stopped

1050
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
producing it

1051
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
it was one of the um

1052
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,040
must use film because it gives you this

1053
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,680
really

1054
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,320
retro grain like you have really it's

1055
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,000
not pixels but

1056
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,480
you see uh really dots of black and

1057
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,359
white

1058
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,320
and you know these crunch effects which

1059
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,359
is

1060
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,400
kind of authentic and yeah 3x really

1061
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
gives you this

1062
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,640
this effect while being cheap

1063
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,960
all right the next question is a fun one

1064
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,000
uh who is your

1065
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,280
favorite batman villain and why

1066
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,920
um i don't really have i think it

1067
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,640
would be i know it's mainstream but i

1068
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
love the joker

1069
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,760
yeah the way it was depicted in the

1070
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
films

1071
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
is a really interesting way of uh

1072
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,400
treating the character so yeah

1073
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,920
it would be the joker and the final

1074
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
question i have for you from

1075

1087

it's a dying art and and hopefully we

1100
