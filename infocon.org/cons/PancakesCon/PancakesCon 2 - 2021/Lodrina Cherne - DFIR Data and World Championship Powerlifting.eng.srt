i'm excited to speak with you

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
so today my talk is going to be about

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
deferred data

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,719
and world championship power lifting

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
i am going to talk about forensics first

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,920
so i've got a lot of ground to cover let

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
me kick it off

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
to those of you who don't know me i'll

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,360
share a quick introduction

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,079

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
my day job is at cybereason that's the

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:55,680
owl

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,719
i work for our office of the cso where i

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
get to work on standards and policy

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,119
institute

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,360
so if you're interested in the technical

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
content i present today you can come

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
hang out and spend six days with me

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
learning

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,920
all kinds of nitty gritty about it but

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
there's two other things

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
uh professionally that i'd like to share

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
with all of you one

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
is that i'm in a program at the aspen

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
tech policy hub

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
aspen tech policy hub develops future

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
policy leaders

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
and if you're interested in policy or

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
interested in learning about it

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
please reach out to me and also please

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,640
reach out to me

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
if especially if you are local to the

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
boston cambridge area

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,920
that's where i'm coming in from today so

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,200
i'd love to meet more local people

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,439
so let's keep going here

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,600
i have a ton of information to share

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
with you

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,280
i'm going to start with a very basic

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
introduction to what digital forensics

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
is

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
and then we'll start to look at some

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,719
digital forensic data

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
so i know that pancakes con has a lot of

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,080
people who are

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,038
new to infosec who are just trying to

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
get their feet wet in the field

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,920
so for those of you who don't know what

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
digital forensics

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,599
or dfir which stands for digital

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
forensics and incident response

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,400
is digital forensics is a branch of

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,440
forensic science

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
dealing with identification preservation

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
analysis and reporting of digital

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
evidence

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
so if you are somebody who happens like

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
me to be a fan

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,640
of tv crime shows i'm totally

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
a big fan it is way more than just zoom

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
and enhance

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
what it can involve are specialties

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
in computers and host-based forensics

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,959
that's mainly what i do

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
it can also involve cell phones network

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
forensics looking at packets

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
memory malware cloud and

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
the field is really evolving um

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,640
it's not that long ago that more people

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,200
started talking about connected vehicles

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
uh smart home devices and

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
um you know that's what excites me

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
about the field is getting to be that

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
digital crime solver who comes in

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
after the fact and figures out what

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,640
happens

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,319
on a system when it's handed to me

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
so what we're going to dive into today

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
is even if you are brand spanking new to

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
digital forensics

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
i want to share with you some things

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
that you can look for

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
as you use your devices as you use your

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
computer and your cell phone

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
to figure out when there might be

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,799
digital forensic data

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
that can be recovered by somebody who

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
comes along after the fact

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,159
like myself now your reasons for wanting

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
to know about this information can be

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
different you might have a different

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,000
threat

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
model than your friend

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
or your neighbor and so there are

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
different reasons you might want to know

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,120
about this

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,760
but the first step is going to be

109
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,560
identifying data

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,358
so if you are a microsoft office user

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
like i am

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
you might know and be familiar with when

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,639
you open up

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
word for the first time in a session

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
it might prompt you to open recent

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
documents

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
this is the kind of thing i'm going to

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
be talking about completely throughout

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
this whole defer section

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
which is if your computer is remembering

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,759
that

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
yesterday you worked on this

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
word document it's got to be stored

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,840
somewhere

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
now those of you who are a little more

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
familiar with forensics i'm going to try

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
and give you some nuggets too

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
i'm going to share with you for each of

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
these artifacts i talk about

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
where you can track down the data so for

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,479
example

132
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
in this case when you open microsoft

133
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
word this data is going to be found

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,320
in the empty user.dat registry file

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,360
but wait there's more

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,080
so if you're a windows user you might be

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
used to right-clicking

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
on one of these microsoft office

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
applications

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
and seeing your recent documents in this

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
other location

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
well that is stored in a completely

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
different set of artifacts

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
and these involve jump lists and

145
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
shortcuts

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
or shortcuts or sometimes called link

147
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,400
files or dot

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
lnk files so

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
one application like microsoft word is

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
so robust it's storing information

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
all over your system to try and make the

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
system easier to use for you

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,919
and by the way when you notice something

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,759
that just popped up at the top of my

155
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
screen

156
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
that says recover unsaved documents

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
that's a sign that your information is

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,319
being tracked

159
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,880
i'm going to take a quick pause and just

160
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:21,840
do an audio check here

161
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
all right and i should be back with my

162
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,919
audio now

163
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
let's continue on

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,680
what i've got up on my screen

165
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
is an example of how your computer knows

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
that you have downloaded files

167
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,919
so if you open up a word document that's

168
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
downloaded from the internet

169
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
you might see something like this pop up

170
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,199
you might see

171
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
this yellow bar that goes across the

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
screen

173
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
that says be careful files from the

174
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
internet can contain viruses

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,280
do you want to open this document

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
so this is one example

177
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,720
of something that shows you're being

178
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
trapped

179
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,199
by the way this is stored in an

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,440
alternate data stream zone identifier

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,639
so this is a little piece of information

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
that goes along

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
with your file that says it's been

184
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,479
downloaded from the internet

185
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
and i'm going to go through a few more

186
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
examples because right now you might be

187
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,879
thinking

188
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
how did my computer know this about me

189
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,360
well it's being tracked in different

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
places all over your system

191
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
incognito browsing is one that some

192
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,960
people listening now

193
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
might be familiar with but are you

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
familiar with how

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
incognito browsing or in private

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
browsing

197
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
can track you now

198
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,640
on my screen right now is a clue

199
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
that might tell you that your

200
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
information is being tracked

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,839
even if you're not a digital forensic

202
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,519
professional

203
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
if you have any guesses feel free to

204
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
toss them into slack

205
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
the reason that you might know you're

206
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
being tracked

207
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,959
is that done

208
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,839
let me bring it up

209
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
on this screen are forward and back

210
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
arrows

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
so if you're using an in private or

212
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
incognito session that you can go

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
forwards and backwards

214
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
in your incognito session should be a

215
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,959
clue

216
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
that somewhere your history is being

217
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
tracked

218
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
okay and this is one of my favorites

219
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
file and folder opening

220
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
if you like viewing your photos folder

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
as tiny little previews and icons

222
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
like i have on the right and you like

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
viewing your downloads folder or your

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
documents folder as

225
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,440
a list like i have on the left

226
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
that your computer remembers i always

227
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
want my pictures folder to be tiny

228
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,200
little icons

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
and i always want my documents folder to

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
be a list

231
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
this again means that this artifact is

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,080
being tracked somewhere

233
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,839
which happens to be in shell bags

234
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,880
by the way this artifact a similar

235
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
artifact exists on mac os

236
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,079
computers as well so this is not unique

237
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,560
to windows

238
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,200
and i've hidden a few easter eggs in my

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
presentation

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
and some of them are up on my screen

241
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,600
right now

242
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
i wanted to pay tribute and give a nod

243
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
to some of the female pioneers in

244
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,680
computer science

245
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,959
and um code breaking

246
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,920
who've come before me and i do want to

247
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,560
take

248
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
a very quick serious uh moment

249
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,599
to honor one of them becky bass

250
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
i want to really recognize and share the

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
story of rebecca gurley bass

252
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
who passed away in 2017 it was march

253
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,839
2017

254
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,880
so this is uh somewhat the anniversary

255
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,920
of her passing and she was known

256
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,600
as the dead mother of intrusion

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
detection and also known as info mom

258
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
she was born in alabama and he

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
was a u.s citizen of japanese heritage

260
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
and content warning i will

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,079
just spend one sentence on this i

262
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
especially want to highlight her story

263
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
given the violence against asian

264
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
american people that

265
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
we've seen in atlanta in this past week

266
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
so i want to tell some of her story

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
in 1973 she was the only woman

268
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,279
at university of alabama at birmingham

269
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
in the engineering department

270
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
she went on to work at xerox and nsa

271
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,760
in the national computer security center

272
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
where she was particularly able to

273
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
advocate for women and minorities

274
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
she was the recipient of the nsa

275
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,639
distinguished leadership award

276
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,600
at during her time there she went on to

277
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
become deputy

278
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
security officer at los alamos national

279
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,160
lab

280
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,839
and later in her life she went on to

281
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
become credited with building the fbi's

282
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,760
first computer crime squad and became a

283
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
venture capitalist

284
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
she wrote some books that are

285
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,160
foundational to our field

286
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
including the title intrusion detection

287
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
and she co-authored a guide for forensic

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,200
testimony

289
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
but in addition to these titles she is

290
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,519
remembered fondly as somebody who cared

291
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,240
about people

292
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
um the more

293
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,680
i was reading about her story

294
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
in preparation for this talk the more i

295
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
wish i'd gotten to know her

296
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,920
and i was told that

297
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,480
basesecurity.org bace security.org is

298
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
one place you can keep up

299
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,639
with efforts to honor her legacy

300
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,800
so i'm very thankful that at this

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
conference we're talking not just about

302
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
technical issues but about expanding our

303
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
horizons

304
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
and i thought that given the events of

305
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
the last week

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,320
and what we're talking about today all

307
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
kinds of things

308
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
infosec related and not that this might

309
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,399
be a good time

310
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
to honor becky's memory

311
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
so back to

312
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
i tacky things gears i did want to share

313
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
another artifact that i love which is

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
these little folder previews i mentioned

315
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,440
in my last slide

316
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
these tiny little previews are saved

317
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
on your computer so on windows they're

318
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
saved in your thumb cache or the

319
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
thumbs.dv file

320
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,279
and by the way even if i deleted

321
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,800
this folder and tried to remove any

322
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,680
evidence that i

323
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,720
ever was in this folder ever had these

324
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
files

325
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,399
these little previews still stick around

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
so for a forensic investigator like me

327
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,639
these artifacts are really gold mines to

328
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
find data after the fact

329
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
one reason that you as a user might know

330
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
that these little icons exist

331
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
is if you have a really giant folder

332
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,360
full of photos

333
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
like your vacation photos the first time

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,959
you go to

335
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
load and open up that folder these

336
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
little previews take a while to generate

337
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,560
sometimes

338
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
but the second time you go into that

339
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
folder they load much

340
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
faster so this should be your clue okay

341
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
that loaded way faster

342
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
i think these icons might be cached

343
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
somewhere

344
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,399
so things to look out for

345
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,639
there's way way way nerdier

346
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,880
low-level things being tracked on your

347
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
system

348
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,680
sticking with windows the fact that

349
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,560
you can delete your usage history that

350
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,959
you can delete

351
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,920
how many cycles how much cpu time you've

352
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
spent in certain applications

353
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
the mere fact that you can delete this

354
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
information

355
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
means it's being tracked somewhere and

356
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,560
in this case

357
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
this is in your system resource

358
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
utilization management database or your

359
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,279
strum

360
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
db

361
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
once you start to think about this you

362
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
will see examples

363
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,519
all over the place how did your computer

364
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,240
know

365
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
that we had for those of us in the

366
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
united states

367
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,839
a time zone changed last week

368
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
and this does not apply just to

369
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,199
computers

370
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,320
windows mac linux this also applies

371
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
to your mobile phones this one

372
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
has been very very obvious to me

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,399
that our phones are recording what we

374
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,240
type because i have a super

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,839
unique name i do not know and have never

376
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
met another loadrena

377
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
so every time i get a new phone and i

378
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
need to type in my name

379
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
i get those red squiggly lines coming up

380
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
saying is this really the way you want

381
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
to spell this

382
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,720
but after i tell my phone the first time

383
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,360
no

384
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
that's really the spelling of my name i

385
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
want you to remember that

386
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,360
it remembers my name from then on

387
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,959
the same thing happens with mobile

388
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
predictive text

389
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,600
your phones know what words you like to

390
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
type together

391
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
and in this case there's a database on

392
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,759
your phone that is tracking

393
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
what words you type what words you type

394
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
near those words

395
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
and again after the fact somebody like

396
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,000
me can come

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
in and recover that database

398
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,519
and figure out what you were doing

399
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,199
so again for many of you you might be

400
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
new to this field you might be trying to

401
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,319
get

402
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
into digital forensics you might be

403
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,679
thinking this

404
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
is maybe a career you'd like to pursue

405
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
here is your big takeaway

406
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
if it's remembered for you it can be

407
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
recovered

408
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
the next couple shots i have to share

409
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
with you are things that i took

410
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
screenshots of

411
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
for myself to remind myself

412
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,400
this looks like an interesting artifact

413
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,160
i wonder if i can find out where this is

414
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,120
saved

415
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,039
so things like when windows upgrades

416
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,000
when sticky notes is telling me that

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
it's remembering something for me

418
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
or when powerpoint is telling me

419
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,400
it will save a copy of my data even if

420
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,840
i don't go and hit save

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
again the best thing you can do to get

422
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,240
into digital forensics

423
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,520
is having the right mindset to be aware

424
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
of these

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
things to be asking questions and to be

426
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
inquisitive

427
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,760
because remember systems are always

428
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
changing and

429
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
every time a major os upgrade happens

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,880
there is no manual that comes out that

431
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,039
says you can find the forensic artifacts

432
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,679
here

433
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,200
here and here and here's what they all

434
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
mean so the best thing you can do is

435
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
observe

436
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
and hypothesize what you think might be

437
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
happening

438
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,720
test things out

439
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
and keep trying report iterate

440
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
share your findings with your peers

441
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
again if you are new to the field there

442
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
are lots of ways to get involved

443
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,000
i think many of you who found this con

444
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,520
are probably on twitter

445
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,320
there's a great community under hashtag

446
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,000
dfir

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
so i hope to see you there

448
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,600
and now halfway through

449
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
i get to pivot topics

450
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200
and i feel so fortunate to be able to

451
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
share

452
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,799
a little bit about powerlifting with you

453
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,960
so here's how we're going to start we're

454
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
going to start talking about the basics

455
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,799
and then we're going to talk about

456
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,760
competition powerlifting

457
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,080
so i'm going to introduce myself again

458
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,039
hi my name is laudrina cherny i've

459
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,840
competed

460
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
all over the country and all over the

461
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
world i've won

462
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,840
national and international competitions

463
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,200
i've stood on podium

464
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
at the world championships and set

465
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,520
multiple state and federation records

466
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
so

467
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,840
what does this all mean what is power

468
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
lifting

469
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
power lifting is a barbell sport and it

470
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
consists of three lifts

471
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
there's the squat the bench press

472
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,880
and the deadlift so

473
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
in the power lifting competition your

474
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,480
goal

475
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
is to lift the most weight possible in

476
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
all three lifts

477
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,400
so in competition which is also called a

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,559
powerlifting meet

479
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
in a meet when you go up to the platform

480
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
and you are in front of that audience

481
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
and in front of those judges

482
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,240
your goal is to go successfully squat

483
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,200
the barbell

484
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
with a barbell on your back lower

485
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,120
yourself down and then come back up

486
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
you try that three times your best

487
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,400
successful lift

488
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
in the squat is recorded

489
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
then you go and you do a bench press

490
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,720
lying on the bench pressing your barbell

491
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,039
from full extension down to your chest

492
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,640
and back up again

493
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,240
you do that three times your best most

494
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,799
successful lift is recorded

495
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
and then the deadlift is where the

496
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
competition ends that's your standard

497
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,880
pick things up and put them down left

498
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,840
your best successful deadlift is

499
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,240
recorded

500
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,000
so your most successful squat plus

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
bench press weight plus deadlift is your

502
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
total

503
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
and that's what you're judged and scored

504
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
on

505
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
so we'll get into each of the lists in

506
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
just a minute

507
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,000
but when we're talking about competition

508
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
i want to talk a little bit more about

509
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,440
how you would get

510
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,480
into a competition and what that means

511
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
so let's talk about competing in power

512
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
lifting

513
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,240
so you are here and you're thinking

514
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,440
i love training in the gym i'm pretty

515
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
good with a barbell i'm going to do a

516
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
meet

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
awesome welcome i

518
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
would love to help you do that

519
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
here's how to do that

520
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
uh by the way before i start this

521
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,440
section i will say

522
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
just as much as i both teach

523
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
a week-long technical class and attend

524
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
lots of technical training

525
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
i've been in powerlifting long enough

526
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
that i also for fun

527
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
go to coaching conferences that are

528
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,000
three days long a week long so

529
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
i could go on and on about this topic

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
forever

531
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,919
but my tldr moment is i'm going to say

532
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,039
find a meat you can google this

533
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,360
up you can go to a site like power

534
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
lifting watch

535
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
and powerlifting watch has listings of

536
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
meats you can do all over the united

537
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
states and all over the world

538
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,799
so if you pick something local you're

539
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
going to be in a certain federation

540
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
and different federations have different

541
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
rules

542
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
and different divisions but finding a

543
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,120
meet that maybe you can

544
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
drive to or something that's

545
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,320
a really short trip away from wherever

546
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
you're training

547
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
is going to be a great place to meet

548
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,679
more local lifters and get your feet wet

549
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,840
and i say just find the meat because

550
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,159
everything else i'm going to talk about

551
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,240
kind of depends on the type of event

552
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
you're going to

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,679
now in powerlifting there are different

554
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,000
divisions for example

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,559
there are weight classes and potentially

556
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
even age classes

557
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
so just like a sport like wrestling

558
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
like mma

559
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,080
you are going to be in a weight class my

560
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
best advice

561
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,559
is for your first meet go in weighing

562
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,440
whatever

563
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
you are weighing that day

564
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
because there are going to be so many

565
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
different technical things going on

566
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
um different timing things you have to

567
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
worry about warming up with people

568
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,200
you've never warmed up with before

569
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
that weighing what you weigh when you go

570
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
to a meet

571
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
is just one less thing to worry about

572
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,559
don't worry about making weight

573
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,600
so you can be in a certain weight class

574
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,039
you can potentially sign up for a

575
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
certain age class

576
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,919
and there are also different equipment

577
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,039
divisions you can sign up for

578
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,360
i'll mention power lifting apparel in a

579
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,240
meet

580
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,200
typically means that you need a singlet

581
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,520
you

582
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,640
need that wrestling onesie to compete in

583
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,320
so that judges can see that you're

584
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
performing the lift

585
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
to the correct standard of the rulebook

586
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,039
now this might be my best advice

587
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
for somebody who's interested in

588
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,799
powerlifting interested in doing their

589
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,559
first meet

590
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,480
once you sign up for an event again

591
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
google it up

592
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
or go to powerlifting watch and find a

593
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,799
need to participate in

594
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,000
read the rulebook and the rulebook will

595
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
tell you what you can wear in a beat

596
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,880
it'll probably tell you that you need

597
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
that wrestling singlet

598
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,000
it'll say probably that you can use a

599
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
belt

600
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,320
and the belt can be of a certain

601
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,880
dimension it can't be thicker

602
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
than you know five inches one way or

603
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,679
13 millimeters in width it might tell

604
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,480
you if you can

605
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
use knee sleeves on your knees if you

606
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,240
can use wrist wraps on your wrists

607
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
and it'll tell you a lot about the

608
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
standards of the lift which i'm going to

609
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,879
go into next

610
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,720
oh but first

611
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
one big question

612
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
a lot of people tell me that they love

613
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
training in the gym

614
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,520
they love doing the three barbell lifts

615
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
but they're worried about

616
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,520
not being strong enough

617
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
well i'd like to share this video with

618
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,799
you

619
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
from the lobo high school power lifting

620
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,279
team

621
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,360
um first because they are exceptionally

622
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,440
exceptionally strong and talented young

623
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
ladies

624
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
but i really want to show that

625
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
powerlifting can be for

626
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,639
anyone

627
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
to be able to compete in a meet the

628
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,679
minimum amount of weight you need to

629
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,000
lift

630
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
in a squat is typically the barbell plus

631
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,320
some collars

632
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,120
so we're talking around 55 pounds for

633
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,279
the squat

634
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,840
same thing on the bench press if you can

635
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
bench press

636
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,640
55 pounds again the bar at arm's length

637
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
just like these ladies down to your

638
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
chest and back up again

639
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,320
you are good to go and for the deadlift

640
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
the weight is going to be a little bit

641
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
more because when the barbell is resting

642
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,600
on the ground

643
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
you need to have some of those big

644
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,799
plates on the ground

645
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,720
just like in the video right now

646
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
so typically for the deadlift you'll

647
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,320
need to be able to lift around 140

648
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,000
150 pounds so if you're wondering

649
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
well i'm really not strong enough to do

650
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
a competition

651
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,200
with a little bit of training i suspect

652
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,240
you are

653
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,200
so again if you are interested there's

654
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
very little stopping you

655
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
uh with that out of the way i will go

656
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
into the performance of each of the lips

657
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,039
so with the squat i already mentioned

658
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,399
the barbell

659
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,840
is on your back you

660
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,200
bend down until the crease of your hip

661
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
is below your knee

662
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,039
so just like i am in this video

663
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,640
or in this screen my hip is below my

664
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,159
knee

665
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
and from there i want to come up and

666
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,399
stand up in one smooth motion

667
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,880
if you reach her rulebook for a

668
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
powerlifting federation you'll see that

669
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,919
there are lots of

670
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,880
gotchas about doing the lift for example

671
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
you can't stand up halfway

672
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
sink back down and then stand up the

673
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,799
rest of the way

674
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,039
the barbell needs to move smoothly and

675
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
fluidly all the way down

676
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,000
and all the way back up without any

677
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,799
shaking

678
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,559
or wavering up and down

679
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,960
now there's a few other things going on

680
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
there is a judge sitting in front of you

681
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,159
and that judge after you take the

682
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
barbell out of the rack

683
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
will tell you to start your lift or

684
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,760
start

685
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,200
your squat only then after you've been

686
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
given the start command

687
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
can you actually go down come back up

688
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
and do your lift

689
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,880
but then you have to pause and wait for

690
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
that judge to tell you to rack the bar

691
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,640
to bring it back into the squat stand

692
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
so if you are totally new to this this

693
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,919
is kind of like

694
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,360
patting your head and rubbing your

695
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
stomach and i'm glad

696
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
that you can only see part of me on

697
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,399
video because it's

698
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,360
very hard for me to do but there's a lot

699
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
going on in the meat you've got somebody

700
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
giving you instructions who's in front

701
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,159
of you

702
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
you might have spotters surrounding you

703
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,840
and by the way

704
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
there are judges to your left and to

705
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,960
your right

706
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
making sure that you're getting low

707
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,799
enough

708
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,399
so you've got three judges in this lift

709
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,559
and if they all think that you've done

710
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
the lift successfully

711
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,159
they're going to give you what you hope

712
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
will be three white lights

713
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
by the way if there's one judge who sees

714
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,880
something off

715
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,960
let's say the judge on your right hand

716
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
side doesn't think that you got quite

717
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
deep enough

718
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,679
they might give you a red light but you

719
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,480
know what this

720
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,320
is still okay because two out of three

721
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,640
two white lights out of three possible

722
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
lights for two out of three judges agree

723
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,279
you did a good lift and you will get

724
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,600
credit for that squad

725
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,880
so so far we've learned that even if

726
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,120
you're used to squatting even if you

727
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,600
know how to perform a barbell squat

728
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,080
and you love doing this in the gym in

729
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,880
competition

730
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,480
there's a lot going on so

731
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
now that we've been introduced to the

732
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
judging system and how they give

733
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,080
commands and some of the nuances

734
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,440
let's move on to the bench press

735
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
so the standards of performance for the

736
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,960
bench press

737
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
are kind of similar to the squat you are

738
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,279
going to have a judge

739
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,919
who tells you when to start and when to

740
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,480
end the lift

741
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,080
and when they say start you want to take

742
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
the barbell at arm's length with your

743
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,840
arms locked

744
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,519
bring it smoothly down to your chest

745
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,000
and pause after the bar is motionless

746
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
the judge will tell you to press and

747
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
only then do you get to heat the barbell

748
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
back up again

749
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,399
one smooth motion no ups and downs

750
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,919
no one side and then the other side all

751
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,039
the way

752
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,240
one smooth motion to finish and then

753
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,159
when the judge gives you that command to

754
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,080
rack

755
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
then and only then will you have

756
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,080
successfully completed the lift

757
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,279
now there's even more nuances here

758
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,279
and this is why i said a few slides

759
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,279
earlier find a meet

760
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,159
that tells you what federation you're in

761
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,840
and read the rule book

762
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
because there can be nuances like your

763
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,039
feet have to be

764
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
flat on the ground the whole time

765
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
some federations will allow you to be up

766
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,799
on your tippy toes

767
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,760
but almost every single one will have a

768
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,399
rule

769
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,519
that your shoulders and your butt

770
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,720
need to stay on the bench

771
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
now because we're talking competition

772
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,240
powerlifting

773
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,960
stress on the term competition

774
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
in a competition you can train

775
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,600
to do certain things to really shorten

776
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,120
your range of motion

777
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
and you might see me bringing my chest

778
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
up

779
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,679
effectively arching my back and this

780
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
when done properly is a very safe and

781
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,000
effective mood

782
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,480
effective move to help you lift more

783
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,279
weight

784
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,679
so again competition power lifting there

785
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,399
are going to be

786
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,000
lots of things that you might not be

787
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
used to in the gym

788
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,279
including a start

789
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
a bench and wreck man from the judge

790
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,679
keeping your feet or keeping your toes

791
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,519
on the ground

792
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,240
and keeping your butt your shoulders and

793
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
sometimes your head on the ground as

794
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,600
well

795
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,279
and there are certain ways to play

796
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,640
within the rolls

797
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,480
to maximize the amount of weight that

798
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,440
you're going to lift

799
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,799
now we go on

800
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,679
to my favorite lift the dead left

801
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,600
this is your standard pick things up and

802
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
put them down left

803
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
but there's a couple of variables that

804
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
you the lifter can choose from

805
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
in here as well what you see in my photo

806
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
on the screen from when i was at the uh

807
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,079
world championship competition in

808
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,079
finland a few years ago

809
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,960
is an example of a conventional deadlift

810
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
your feet

811
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
are inside your shoulders

812
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
so your hands are outside of your feet

813
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,960
you can also

814
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,199
lift in a sumo deadlift which is your

815
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,599
legs are out wide and your hands are in

816
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,040
narrower on the barbell one is not

817
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
better than the other necessarily it

818
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,199
depends on your physiology

819
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,719
and your training and coaching and

820
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,639
really your body and comfort level so

821
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,480
in competition the deadlift

822
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,159
is really my favorite lift a couple of

823
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,960
nuances

824
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
include a judge will tell you when to

825
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,199
put the barbell down

826
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,920
and you cannot slam the barbell you

827
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
really need to place it

828
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,800
down gently um if you just

829
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,359
drop the bar when you're done if i were

830
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
to open my hands from this position on

831
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,960
the screen

832
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,000
that lift would be disqualified

833
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
so deadlift happens to be my favorite

834
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
lift

835
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,800
but there's nuances to that in judging

836
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,359
as well

837
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,720
by the way conventional deadlift is my

838
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
favorite right there

839
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
probably because i've been so successful

840
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
with it

841
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,200
so now i get to tell

842
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,240
a little bit of my story

843
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,920
um i don't often get to talk about this

844
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,839
so i'm really excited too here today

845
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,640
uh how on earth did i get into power

846
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,599
lifting

847
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,520
well it actually started with being a

848
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,599
bicycle racer

849
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,079
and i happened to live in new england

850
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,000
and i was cyclocross racing

851
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
one year cyclocross is kind of like the

852
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,440
steeplechase of bicycle racing

853
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,119
it's um a sport where you're competing

854
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,880
in the fall and winter

855
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,320
over asphalt gravel sand

856
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
snow and you're doing this every single

857
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,960
weekend

858
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,599
well one winter here in new england we

859
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,240
had a ton of snow

860
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,640
as much as i am um

861
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,520
let's say not afraid of being out in the

862
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,400
ice and snow

863
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
it was just too much for me one year so

864
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
i started going to the gym

865
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,839
i started lifting weights and the more

866
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,079
i trained the more people would kind of

867
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,440
stop what they were doing and

868
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,079
look at me and kind of say wow that's

869
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,240
really good

870
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
so i i was like okay

871
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
cool i just enjoy doing this but uh it

872
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,760
kept happening enough that i was

873
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
wondering

874
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
am i good for this gym am i good for

875
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,960
a woman am i good for somebody my weight

876
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,040
like i i didn't really know what that

877
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
meant and i didn't really know

878
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
how good i could be if i wanted to

879
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
so i signed up for power lifting me not

880
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
knowing that you need to stay lift

881
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,400
um not knowing really much about the

882
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
rules and i just

883
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
went and tried it out and really fell in

884
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,119
love with the sport

885
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
um over the years i started competing at

886
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,760
local meets

887
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,400
i was doing really well i actually

888
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,040
switched

889
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,680
federations and started competing in an

890
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,400
organization that had more competition

891
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
so i could compete against more people

892
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
my size

893
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,440
and compete at a more competitive

894
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,359
national championships

895
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,200
and that national championships would

896
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
set me up for

897
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,599
the world championship level competition

898
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,119
that you've seen pictures from

899
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,280
earlier in this competition so

900
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,359
i found out that i was really good at it

901
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,119
and i took it really far

902
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,280
i've been doing power lifting for the

903
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,359
last 10 years

904
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,400
and loving it i've

905
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,160
done it all over the world in a bunch of

906
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
weight classes

907
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,160
however i think

908
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
one of the things that's most special to

909
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,400
me and you've heard me say

910
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,040
i've changed federations i've changed

911
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,640
where i've competed

912
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,359
to be in a more competitive group

913
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,240
i'm very very proud of doing things that

914
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
are fairly rare in the sport

915
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
which is at a lot of those competitions

916
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,440
i've competed

917
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
at a team level where you try and get

918
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,079
people from different weight classes

919
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:40,960
together

920
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,119
and try and get composite of people

921
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,880
across different genders across

922
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,440
different divisions and weight classes

923
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,359
to really create a united front

924
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,560
and i'm very honored to have had coaches

925
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
and training partners who have done that

926
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,440
with me

927
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
over the years and i hope to make it

928
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,200
back to the international stage again

929
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,598
soon

930
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,399
so

931
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,920
sometimes when i tell people my story

932
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
and how far i've gone in the sport

933
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,000
they asked me well what about going to

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
the olympics

935
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,040
now unfortunately powerlifting is not an

936
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,599
olympic

937
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
level sport if you see a barbell sport

938
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
in the olympics

939
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,200
that barbell sport is where

940
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,880
people are lifting up the barbell over

941
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,040
their head and the barbell ends up

942
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,560
way up high over their head that is the

943
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,119
sport

944
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,640
of olympic lifting um

945
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,839
in olympic lifting

946
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,400
well it's different than power lifting

947
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,839
however

948
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,920
powerlifting does have the world games

949
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
which is a quadrennial event every four

950
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,560
years

951
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
that i hope to make it to one year for

952
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,880
non-olympic sports

953
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,480
and there is also paralympic

954
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,839
lifting in the olympics so there are

955
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
bench press athletes who use a

956
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,599
specialized bench press

957
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,920
and here this is loveline obg from

958
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,200
nigeria

959
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,440
uh taking her last attempt at the bench

960
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,520
press and she eventually

961
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,640
won gold in that competition

962
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,160
so i hope that you've been entertained

963
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
with uh

964
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,000

i want to give a shout out to a couple

ladrina

993
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,160
um uh it looks like we do have a couple

994
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
of questions they seem to be mostly

995
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,720
focused on the

996
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,440
car lifting side of things uh we have

997
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,839
one

998
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,079
as to what's your favorite or preferred

999
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,359
deadlift form

1000
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,000
and they offer romanian standard and

1001
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,839
sumo as

1002
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,359
options standard conventional deadlift

1003
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,319
love it love it love it

1004
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,839
uh we have another question uh a little

1005
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,839
clarification what is the not

1006
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,960
slamming about ooh

1007
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,400
then not slamming weights in competition

1008
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,880
well first of all it's a respect thing

1009
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,800
uh showing respect to the judges

1010
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,839
to the organizer equipment

1011
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,560
to the people around you and it can also

1012
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,480
be a safety thing when you have people

1013
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,400
who are spotting and loading around you

1014
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,440
you don't want weights that are slamming

1015
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
around and maybe uh getting out of

1016
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,480
control

1017
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,680
and hitting them so in competition a

1018
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,119
safety and respect thing

1019
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,160
