1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
we have ben gores with new linux tools

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,880
for blue team

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,080
and big kid rockets ben comes to us

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,400
as the lead of counter threat management

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
at kimberly clark

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,320
and apparently is involved in protecting

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,079
the world's toilet paper supply which

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,000
after the past year i think we can all

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,199
agree is a very critical role

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,480
so ben ah go ahead and unmute

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,039
and uh we can go ahead and get started

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,240
with you

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
thanks well welcome everybody um

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
so what i wanted to share today is a

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
tool set that i

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
use every single day um linux terminals

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
are a great swiss army knife and i just

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,040
wanted to kind of

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
work through a couple examples uh tempt

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
the gods by doing some

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
some actual live demos to show

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
a couple of the use cases i find

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,719
beneficial but i really think this

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,199
should be in everybody's tool set

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
for a few reasons one is

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
uh this concept of a non-a-trib server

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,440
and i'm using that

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
pretty loosely for anybody who's

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
actually had a true non-entrep server

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
but

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
in this case i'm talking about having a

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
server that's not

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
clearly related to your organization

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,479
being able to

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
have a little anonymity to do some of

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
the poking around

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
you might want to do as a defender

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,479
without uh tipping off your adversary

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,159
that they are uh you know being

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,520
investigated

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
um it's definitely safer than doing the

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,759
research in-house if you uh

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
accidentally execute some malware you're

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,840
not doing it inside your network

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
uh the traffic ioc lookups all that's

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,240
not coming from internally

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
also another benefit is if you make a

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
whoopsie or even if you don't and you're

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
just generating an exhaust trail of iocs

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
you're not going to accidentally

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
generate security alerts on yourself

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
i have had my machine ripped off my desk

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,720
before and the network cable yanked out

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,960
because i made a little tiny oopsie and

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
you don't want to have those opsec

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
things following you around

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
so i'll do some live demos but you can

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560
really run these

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
pretty much anywhere the the host i'll

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,119
use today cost me about 10

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
a year it's a very inexpensive tool um

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,480
you can use ram node which is one that i

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
i tend to like a lot but also some of

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,160
the same infrastructure the bad guys use

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
vulture ovh hetzner um any of those

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
you know the bad guys are using them

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
because they're cheap uh you can do the

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,680
same

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
uh whatever's reliable uh it's a good

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
basic tool set

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319
what we'll actually cover today uh are

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,599
some of the things on the screen and

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
don't worry i've got a github

74
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
link later in the presentation where you

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
can

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
go pull all this stuff that will run

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
through it's really nothing

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
revolutionary but hopefully working

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
through some of it you'll pick up one or

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
two that you didn't know were there

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
and in the process maybe learn a thing

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
or two about how to more efficiently use

83
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
your terminal

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
so with that i'm going to uh go ahead

85
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,840
and

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
pull up a terminal window i've got a

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
little demo terminal here

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
and just run through a few things

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
so i have a directory full of some files

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
we're going to work through today

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,599
and the first one i'm going to look at

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,239
is sketchy.jse

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
this is a sketchy jse file that

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
you know was referred maybe looks like

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
malware or something we want to dig into

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
a little bit

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,239
so the first thing i'm going to run

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,720
through is just this file command

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
which looks at the file headers and

100
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
gives you basically a

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
a quick snapshot of what is this file in

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,560
this case

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,120
sketchy.jsc is an ascii text file

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
and we can just run through like head or

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,640
tail command

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
you know take a little look at what's in

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,200
it this looks pretty ugly

108
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,799
highly obfuscated javascript code

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,400
we're not getting a really clear idea of

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
what this does

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
but we have a decent idea that it's

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,959
it doesn't look like much of the

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,120
legitimate code i've ever seen

114
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
there's a lot of bobfusion going on here

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
so it's not telling us a lot off hand

116
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
but it does look a little sket a little

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,120
sketchy hence sketchy.jsc

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
one other thing i want to show you about

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
that file command

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,798
we have another one here cs http.pdf i'm

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
going to run file on that

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,478
and you might say oh it's going to come

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
up as a pdf or something nope

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
it comes up as a pe32 so we've got a

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
windows 32 executable

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
because file is looking at the headers

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,080
of the file

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,120
not just the extension so if you have uh

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
things that are

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,479
you know hiding malware in png files or

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,680
something like that

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
a file can actually give you a much

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
better read than you're just going to

134
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
have with your eyeball alone so

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,919
we know that sketchy.jse file looks

136
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,800
kinda weird

137
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
maybe something we want to poke at a

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
little more what a lot of analysts will

139
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,320
do especially new analysts is take that

140
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
and upload it to something like

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,479
virustotal

142
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,520
and virustotal is a great tool but

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,080
usually it's a pretty rookie mistake to

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
accidentally at some point

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,880
upload sensitive data to virustotal or

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
something that kind of hints that your

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
organization is being targeted

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,520
maybe it has strings of your uh

149
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
your domain name in there or something

150
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
it's definitely not something you want

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,120
to

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
get in the habit of doing so a much

153
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
safer option

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,240
is to do the sha sha 256 sum or

155
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
md5 sum and i'll just show you those

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
quickly so

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
sha 256 sum md5 sum

158
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
uh by the way quick uh quick

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,919
little linux tidbit that i took an

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,000
embarrassingly

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,400
embarrassingly long time to learn myself

162
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
is tab complete so i have md5

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
sum as the command i want to run i'm

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
going to type in just the first two

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
characters the file name

166
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
and i'm going to hit the tab key and it

167
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
will complete that so especially when

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
you have things like

169
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
really long installer names or something

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
tab complete is a great way to not have

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,639
to

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,080
you know hunt and pack for every key

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,080
md5 sum for sketchy.jsc gives me the md5

174
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,560
some

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
pretty straightforward what these are

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,479
but what i can do then is just take that

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,520
out of my terminal

178
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,759
window pop it into virustotal

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
and now i haven't uploaded the sample

180
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
i've just looked at what someone else's

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,759
analysis has said so it's a much safer

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
safer way of of doing analysis without

183
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
giving up your files or accidentally

184
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,400
uploading sensitive company information

185
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
all i'm giving virustotal here is the

186
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
hash

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
so i have some analysis i can see you

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,880
know

189
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
some of these av agents are calling it

190
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,639
nemacod

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
interesting somebody here in the

192
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
community some some do-gooder here has

193
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
uh told me that this sample connects to

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,039
this ip address

195
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,680
so i'm going to take that and pivot to a

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
couple other tools

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
back to my terminal i have this ip

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
address that i picked up from the

199
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
buyer's total analysis i'm just going to

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
do a quick who is on that

201
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,199
so whois not only works for domain names

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
to give you the registering information

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
but it also will

204
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,120
will give you some data about most ip

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,199
addresses so in this case i've just done

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,039
a who is for the ip address

207
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
i can see this is a king servers

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
branded server sitting purportedly in

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
the netherlands of course you can do a

210
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
trace route if you want to trace route

211
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,319
that out a little bit

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
so i know a little bit about this this

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
doesn't look like a party i maybe

214
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
want on my network necessarily just me

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
personally maybe you do i don't know but

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
you know i'm getting context i'm making

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,879
a guess so if i want to take that

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
and let's just pretend for a second i

219
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
don't have my fancy analysis tools my

220
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
elk stack or whatever

221
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
i really want let's just say i'm kind of

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,599
in the field doing some analysis

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
well maybe i have a firewall.log

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
file i'm just going to take that ip

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
address

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and use grep to go look for it in the

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,720
firewall.log file

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
i'm going to use the dash f switch

229
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,599
that's for fixed so by default grep will

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,400
do a search that can include regex by

231
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
using fixed i'm giving up some of that

232
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,520
capability

233
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,319
limiting it to only fixed characters so

234
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
i can't do these kind of pattern matches

235
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
but it runs faster especially on big

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
files when you're starting to talk about

237
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,760
multi-gigabyte type files so

238
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
in this case i have six hits

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
in that file now you might ask how big

240
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,519
was that this is a pretty small sample

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,160
i'm going to use word count dash l

242
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,399
wc-l for the firewall.log

243
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,360
file

244
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,480
oops um what am i doing wrong here

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
word count dash l firewall.log there we

246
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,680
go

247
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,080
um that file has 3600

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
and un and change rows and i just picked

249
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
out six really quickly it could just as

250
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,399
easily have a million

251
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,240
one great thing about these linux tools

252
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
is a lot of them were written

253
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
ages ago when memory was was really

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
precious and they'll run on really big

255
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,000
files

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
they're very memory and and often cpu

257
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,519
efficient

258
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
so great way to kind of do a cluj

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
uh look up on some of this i've used

260
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
this in programs that have had zero

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
budget for whatever reason

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
um maybe you have files that you can get

263
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
you know logs you can get

264
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
but you don't have the analysis you

265
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
don't have any budget uh

266
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
budget to go get analysis infrastructure

267
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
you can just you know use this with a 10

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
a year linux host

269
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
so let's pivot for a second away from ip

270
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,680
addresses because those are pretty

271
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
straightforward

272
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
let's say i have a

273
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
a domain name i want to look at a little

274
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,000
deeper

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
in this case differentia.ru is just one

276
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
ioc i've i've picked for a demo today

277
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
i'm going to use the dig command to do a

278
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
dns lookup on it

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,880
and see this uh resolves to two ips

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
of course you can do the whois learn a

281
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
little bit more about the context what

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
are those ips

283
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,880
maybe the tools telling me this is you

284
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
know

285
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
related to an alert that i want to look

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
into i can get my own context i don't

287
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,279
have to just

288
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
inherently trust my tools so

289
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
the whois tells me this is sitting out

290
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
in google cloud

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,839
um you know it's not tied maybe to a

292
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,120
service provider that i

293
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
i know i'm doing business with

294
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
legitimately you know gives me a little

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
idea maybe i want to end map it

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
and just go uh see what ports are open

297
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
you can definitely use some red team

298
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
tools

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
great tool sets like this you can be a

300
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
little more flexible in your tool set

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,720
when you

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
don't actually have the attribution of

303
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
the ip address

304
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,839
to worry about you can blow away these

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
machines start them up

306
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
wherever you want on that subject of

307
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,680
blowing away machines starting them up

308
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
that can be a real advantage too i've

309
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
had some investigations for instance

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,160
where

311
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
there's geo targeting one that stands

312
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,399
out to me was

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,480
a phishing email that purported to be

314
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
from a mexican

315
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
you know fishing lure a couple mexican

316
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
companies written in spanish language

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
when you investigated the link that it

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
included if you were in the united

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
states or most other countries it

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
would send a http 200 response with a

321
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,440
fake

322
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
404 error page if you tried it from

323
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
within mexico

324
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
it would return malicious code so

325
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
geo-targeting and it's really

326
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,839
easy and inexpensive to go spin up a

327
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,279
machine in mexico for

328
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
you know 10 bucks for a month and uh go

329
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
test that theory and in that case that's

330
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,480
exactly what we did and

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,200
it worked out to be an interesting find

332
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
and not a lot of valuable context for

333
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
really cheap

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
so i know port 80 and 443 are open

335
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
i'm gonna just curl that really quickly

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
to see what's actually out there

337
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,360
um what's answering in this que in this

338
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,320
case

339
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
uh sinkhold by kryptos logic so curl

340
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,680
another great

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
very very flexible command a million

342
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,959
switches

343
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
uh another one in the same line let's

344
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
say i'm doing some thread intel

345
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,880
or or you know i'm in one of those

346
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
situations where i have no budget and i

347
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,760
need to

348
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
build a little ioc search or something

349
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
like that i need to

350
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,680
to get into threat intel ioc

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,079
processing well one thing i'm going to

352
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,800
try here

353
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
is oops kryptos didn't copy the right

354
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
part

355
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
um wget is another command in the same

356
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,200
vein of

357
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
curl except this is just a little

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
simpler and it always saves to disk you

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,638
don't have to worry about the

360
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
the switches and all the fancy stuff to

361
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
direct it i'm just gonna w

362
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,680
get uh rules. emerging threats so this

363
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,000
is

364
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
uh proofpoint emerging threats lists

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
bunch of block rules of compromised ips

366
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
w get it it pulls it down and now i have

367
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,839
compromised ips.txt sitting right there

368
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,560
so i can get data onto my machine that

369
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
way that's pretty easy there's a lot of

370
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
great lists you can pull

371
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
just that way dedupe them track them

372
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,800
over time

373
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
super flexible tool let's say i wanted

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
to add a little more context

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
one thing i can do is take a list of

376
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,360
of data and use other tools outside of

377
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,240
the terminal

378
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
and then bring it back to the terminal

379
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,240
another way one of my favorites is excel

380
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,120
so what i'm going with here is if i just

381
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
do

382
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
head of that compromised ips list

383
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
it's just a whole bunch of ip addresses

384
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,800
one per line

385
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
let's pop that over to excel and see

386
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,839
what we could do or

387
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
you know not excel in this case google

388
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
sheets

389
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
if i have a list of ip addresses one of

390
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
my favorite

391
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,680
things to do you can literally just cat

392
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,839
the list of ip addresses copy it

393
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
straight out of putty or whatever your

394
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,560
terminal is

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,519
paste it into an excel or excel like

396
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
spreadsheet tool

397
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,040
and then use this concatenate command

398
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
to take that data in this case what's in

399
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
cell a2

400
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
i'm inserting into a command whois

401
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,160
space then that data and i'm taking the

402
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,720
output

403
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
and directing it to an output file

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,399
and i'm going to do sleep 1

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,959
sleep 1 2

406
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
sorry behind me threat butt map

407
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
decided to turn the sound on um so

408
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
who is data to an output file sleep one

409
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
so i don't just completely overrun

410
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,320
the uh the speed of who is and start

411
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
getting myself on block lists

412
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
the brilliant part here is once you've

413
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
written that once you can just double

414
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,880
click

415
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
it'll copy down this could be you know

416
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,959
in this case it's three i p addresses

417
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
but it could just as easily be three

418
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
thousand

419
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,720
then you can just copy all that back out

420
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
head back to the terminal

421
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
and paste them in uh you can paste them

422
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
into a script run the script

423
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
let it sit and uh just you know walk

424
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
away have lunch and come back and it's

425
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,680
run

426
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
however many commands just whatever the

427
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
uh the delay timer is

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,399
it's a really great huge way to do

429
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,519
large-scale

430
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,040
uh work and not even take the time to

431
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,639
write a script

432
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
nothing against scripting but sometimes

433
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,079
uh

434
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
you know the troubleshooting can make it

435
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,279
more time

436
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,720
more more trouble than it's worth

437
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,519
so concatenate copying back and forth

438
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,480
between excel

439
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,320
really quick way to get some work done

440
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,759
what if i did want to write a script

441
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
bash scripts are very easy to write

442
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
i'm just going to use nano to look at

443
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,880
what's in this

444
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
lookup geo script

445
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
so i have an ip list really similar to

446
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
the one i just pulled down

447
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
and i'm running it through a while loop

448
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,600
where it's reading in

449
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
and having an ip variable for every line

450
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
then using curl to hit an api this is a

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
geo location api that outputs

452
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
data in a csv format inserting the ip

453
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,240
address

454
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
and passing some fields that it once

455
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,440
returned

456
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
you can do a lot more than just this but

457
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
basically i'm building an api

458
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
integration straight from the command

459
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
line here

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
and being able to run it from a bash

461
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,880
script i'm appending the output to this

462
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,040
ipresult.csv

463
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
file and then because this particular

464
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,040
api

465
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
has a rate limit of 45 lookups per

466
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
minute

467
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,799
i'm using a sleep timer within the loop

468
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
just so that i reduce my my rate of run

469
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,839
so in this case sleeps two seconds so

470
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,520
therefore if the script just runs

471
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
instantaneously i've have 60 seconds a

472
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,599
minute divided by 2 i'm running

473
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,799
30 queries per minute or less because

474
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,520
the

475
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,119
the query itself will take time so

476
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
that's just how i'm staying within my

477
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
api rate limiter

478
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
really simple way to do it so you'll

479
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
have to deal with permissions

480
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,400
i already have this one as executable

481
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,120
and

482
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
so i am ready to just uh run it

483
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,080
as such dot slash look up

484
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,039
dash geo so it will run

485
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
and in this case i'm not suppressing the

486
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
output or anything uh

487
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
i'm just dumping it directly into the

488
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,679
ipresult file

489
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,120
so i went ahead and killed that for a

490
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
second um and

491
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
i wanted to uh take that output i've

492
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
already run it before

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,480
um and so i have ipresult final which is

494
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,400
the final version of it

495
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
i'm just gonna cat that out show you

496
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,559
what it looks like really quickly

497
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,919
so it's giving me a location an as

498
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,960
number

499
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
the ip address so i've successfully run

500
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
against

501
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,440
run my list against an api got a big

502
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
output file

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
everything's great right well what if i

504
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
want to massage that a little bit

505
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
we already looked at grep a little to

506
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
find the needle in the haystack

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
another cool thing you can do is

508
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,039
have the hay that's left over so let's

509
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,880
say for instance

510
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,360
i have an organization that's you know

511
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
particularly interested in

512
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
uh or particularly based in one country

513
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
let's say my organization is based in

514
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
india for this example

515
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
maybe i want to find all the ip

516
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
addresses and a set of traffic or a set

517
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,720
of iocs that are outside of india maybe

518
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,360
i'm

519
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,240
concerned about traffic outside of my

520
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
own country

521
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
well for that we can use grep and use

522
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,840
the

523
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,360
v switch and so in this case i am

524
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
grepping for every line that does not

525
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
include india

526
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,039
from the ip result underscore final csv

527
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,880
and outputting to the ipresult

528
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,880
outsideindia.csv

529
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
it ran that quickly and now if i

530
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
look at that file

531
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,840
all the the stuff from india has been

532
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,039
removed i'm left with just the original

533
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
i've used this uh for separating

534
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,600
uh taking log files that have a lot of

535
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
internal communication or a lot of

536
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
communication with particular uh

537
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,559
known good destinations and removing all

538
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,480
that traffic and so you can take a

539
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
what is a very large log file and start

540
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
to trim it down

541
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,320
uh by removing known good traffic and

542
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
then have a much more

543
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,880
digestible set of data to look through

544
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
so hopefully that is helpful and has

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,400
taught you

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
something new in terms of command line

547
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
tools

548
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,559
once again great uh great tool set

549
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,520
for basically free runs not only in

550
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
cloud

551
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,679
but a lot of times if you're on site and

552
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,120
trying to

553
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
to do some analysis you can spin one of

554
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,200
these up or you may already have easy

555
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
access to a linux terminal and go run

556
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
this tool set

557
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,960
if you wanted to follow up on anything

558
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,679
that we

559
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
looked at today github.com

560
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
ben gore's slash presentations i've

561
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,760
posted

562
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
all those files so you can go pull it

563
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,679
all in

564
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,200
if you're curious this is the script

565
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
i've been running through it just

566
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,440
runs through all those specific little

567
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
commands that i just did

568
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
so feel free to go out and grab that

569
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,039
spin up a linux server

570
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
have the the same experience and have a

571
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,559
lot of fun

572
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,600
so that's the work fun i do

573
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,240
let me switch now to big kid rockets

574
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
when i was little i used to love model

575
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,600
rockets i

576
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
started building them in scouts you know

577
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
went on to build them at school

578
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,799
flying to my local school yard i always

579
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,400
loved these things

580
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,679
it was just a lot of fun to press the

581
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
button and it's for me anyway especially

582
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
more fun to just

583
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,080
make crazy creations and try not to blow

584
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
myself up

585
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
which i was pretty successful at but

586
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
those have become a lot more fun as i've

587
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
gotten older and gotten back into the

588
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,559
hobby

589
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,360
so what i wanted to cover today is you

590
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
know what they looked like when i was a

591
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
kid versus what they look like now

592
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
some things you can do as an adult or or

593
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
just you know at any age

594
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,760
the sport has changed quite a bit um

595
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
when when i was a kid i was flying low

596
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,679
power rockets mostly

597
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,559
these are motors in the class quarter a

598
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,240
through d

599
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,799
they typically have simple streamers or

600
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,679
parachutes

601
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,000
and cardboard plastic or glue

602
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
construction

603
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
so basically the same stuff you can

604
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,360
probably go to a hobby store and buy a

605
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,559
kit for cheap

606
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
and go fly today and they are still fun

607
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520
but what i found to be a lot more

608
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
interesting is this whole field of mid

609
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
and high power rocketry which has kind

610
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,760
of

611
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,799
evolved over recent years this is motors

612
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,440
where

613
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
uh they're e and up and i'll look at it

614
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
at what that means in a second

615
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
they have delayed deployment so they go

616
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
up and then

617
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
instead of popping the parachute way up

618
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
high in the sky

619
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
they will use different mechanisms to

620
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
basically fall down to earth

621
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
either with a tiny parachute but not the

622
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,400
full one

623
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,159
or with no parachute at all and then

624
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
deploy the parachute

625
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
when they're much closer to the ground

626
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
what that helps you do is

627
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
if there's a wind it won't catch as much

628
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
wind and fly away because

629
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,520
as rockets get bigger and they go higher

630
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
they have a lot more time

631
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,039
as they're coming back down to blow far

632
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,039
away and nobody wants to walk

633
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,840
really really far to go get their rocket

634
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
back

635
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
also the materials there's a lot of

636
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
fiberglass and epoxy rocket construction

637
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,159
and that opens up some new performance

638
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,520
capabilities

639
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
but let's look at specifically what what

640
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,760
are some of these how do they work today

641
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
one question i get a lot is how big are

642
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
they um this is not my rocket that you

643
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,440
see on the screen

644
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,480
i personally um have a bit of a budget

645
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,400
limit that i hold myself to

646
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
some of these rockets can get big and so

647
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,919
the real question is how much do you

648
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,039
want to spend

649
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,360
the rocket in this picture um easily

650
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
you're looking at minimum several

651
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
hundred dollars

652
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,039
uh per launch on the motors some of

653
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,480
these will go up to about two thousand

654
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,840
dollars

655
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,039
and that's just what you have in the

656
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,440
motors that's not talking about the

657
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,120
uh the rocket itself the equipment um

658
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,279
you know the details of finding a site

659
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
to launch a rocket that big so

660
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
you can go there and if you have the

661
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
budget and the willingness

662
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,600
absolutely a lot of fun too but i don't

663
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
personally because

664
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,880
my favorite is this mid power category

665
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
so between the model rockets i used to

666
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
shoot and the really high power stuff

667
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,240
lies this mid power where engines in the

668
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,799
e f

669
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
or g range um the impulse limits

670
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,919
you'll note that these are doubling as

671
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,520
they go so an a b

672
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,919
engine has double the power of an a or

673
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,320
at least that's where the limit lies a c

674
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,679
has double the power of a b

675
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,600
so they're exponentially increasing and

676
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
what i was shooting as a kid caps out

677
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,360
around d

678
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
and so the e the f and the g to me are

679
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,919
still a lot of fun they make a decent

680
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,640
sound

681
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,000
they are relatively affordable and also

682
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,960
you don't have to have any

683
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
certifications

684
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,360
when you get into high power there are

685
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,000
legal

686
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
limits on the size of motor you should

687
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,679
have

688
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
there are different regulatory agencies

689
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
involved as well as

690
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,520
a couple clubs that we'll go into later

691
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,000
a couple organizations that help you

692
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,799
navigate those rules if you do want to

693
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,120
go get permission to do that but

694
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
the way that basically works is if i

695
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
want to if i want to

696
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,279
reach my level three i have to first do

697
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,960
my level one launch

698
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
where i am building a rocket getting a

699
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
motor

700
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,400
um and with proper supervision

701
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
doing a level one launch in a very

702
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
restricted setting where they actually

703
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
watch my launch verify that it was safe

704
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,679
i did all

705
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,080
everything correctly and safely and that

706
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
i recovered my rocket successfully that

707
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
it didn't just fall apart they don't

708
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,640
want people

709
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,880
building giant rockets that explode in

710
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
mid-air and

711
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
you know are dangerous to people so you

712
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
can do your l1

713
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
and then once you've successfully done

714
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
that you are cleared to

715
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,279
try your l2 and and on on up to an l3

716
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
but

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
you know dealing with coordinating that

718
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
isn't as much fun to me personally is

719
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
just pressing the button and watching it

720
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
go

721
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,279
so i like to stick to mid power where

722
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,440
there's no no real certifications

723
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
required

724
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
in terms of technology a lot of things

725
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
have evolved

726
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
the black powder engines that i shot in

727
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,080
the schoolyard are still around

728
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,679
they're still very popular you can still

729
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,279
buy them in hobby stores but they have

730
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,320
downsides

731
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
they're volatile they deal particularly

732
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,799
they have a problem with temperature

733
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,360
swings

734
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,840
and expansion and contraction and on

735
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
very cold days it's not uncommon for

736
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
these things to explode on the launch

737
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,159
pad

738
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,240
if there's contraction and you'll get

739
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,679
cracks through the propellant

740
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,080
that the fire can move up and and cause

741
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
what we call a catastrophic or a cato

742
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,600
explosion so they have uh

743
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
that stability problem they have

744
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,640
relatively low

745
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,559
energy density and just technology wise

746
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,760
they're about the same

747
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,880
uh same basis as a firework a couple

748
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,600
thousand year old technology

749
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
meanwhile you can now get into composite

750
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,039
motors

751
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
these are a different fuel entirely

752
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,120
they're not black powder based

753
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,880
they are an oxidizer with various

754
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
propellants that are burned but

755
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
basically they are the same technology

756
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,080
that's used

757
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,559
in these solid rockets that power the

758
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,240
space shuttle

759
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,360
there are both reloadable options and

760
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
single use options whichever you prefer

761
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,520
i kind of like single use

762
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,399
because if you lose the reloadable part

763
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
that can get pretty expensive like the

764
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,200
casings

765
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
that are reloadable can typically cost

766
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
you know 50 to 100 bucks

767
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,279
and i don't want to worry about having

768
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,240
to to lose that if my

769
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,399
if my launch goes a little wrong so for

770
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,000
an extra dollar to

771
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
i'll get one that's fully one-time use

772
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
and then just throw it away afterward

773
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,960
but the main advantage is

774
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,240
higher energy density and

775
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,600
they're more stable so you can build

776
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,480
bigger motors

777
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
another evolution is in recovery so

778
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
as i said before traditional rockets

779
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,399
they would go up they would pop the

780
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,320
parachute and they would float back down

781
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,279
and that's safe

782
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,559
and it's reliable and that's great but

783
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,240
especially on windy days or when you're

784
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,799
flying to high altitude

785
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,799
you can really have some walks ahead of

786
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,440
you and not only walks but

787
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
when your rocket floats down range for a

788
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,559
mile or two

789
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
the chances of you recovering it really

790
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,679
drop

791
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,840
you want to be able ideally to see where

792
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
your rocket lands and not have too far

793
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
of a walk to go get it

794
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
so one way around that is delayed

795
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
release

796
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,440
these basically use an altimeter to

797
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,880
control when the parachute comes out so

798
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,320
the idea here is they go up the top

799
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,919
will pop off the rocket there's still an

800
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
ejection charge uh that

801
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
will have some event you know the nose

802
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
cone pops out or the rocket separates in

803
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,799
the middle

804
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
so it's it's having some difference in

805
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
drag as it comes down but

806
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,440
it's not popping the full parachute

807
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,159
there's a couple different methods here

808
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,720
the one i prefer is the shoot release

809
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
and i'll i have one that i can

810
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,880
show on video in a minute if we have

811
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,080
time

812
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,640
the other the other method uses

813
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,559
pyrotechnics where you have basically a

814
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,520
second

815
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,360
rocket launch essentially there's a tiny

816
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,000
little igniter with a tiny pyro charge

817
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
that will

818
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,279
pop an extra section that contains a

819
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,320
parachute

820
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,679
either of them works but for me the real

821
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,760
benefit is the shoot release is is

822
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
essentially just a rubber band that gets

823
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
released electronically

824
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,279
and rubber bands don't tend to tend to

825
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,640
fail

826
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,559
trying to pop the pyrotechnics that has

827
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,399
a failure rate that's a little high and

828
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:50,640
i

829
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,840
if i'm gonna have a failure i would

830
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,559
rather

831
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,320
either my rubber band burns through or

832
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
you know gets jostled up way high in the

833
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,600
sky

834
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,039
and then the parachute gets released

835
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,039
that's a much safer method of failure to

836
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,760
me

837
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600
than to have my second deployment fail

838
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
while everything's still contained and

839
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
in many cases

840
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,679
some people actually just not load an

841
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,600
ejection charge into their rocket

842
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
they'll rely entirely on the shoot

843
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,240
release pyrotechnics and if that fails

844
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,520
entirely

845
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,960
then you can get rockets that just fall

846
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
straight back to earth and plant

847
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,919
themselves a couple feet into the dirt

848
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
and tear themselves up so

849
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
my goal is to recover my rockets shoot

850
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,919
releases based on what are essentially

851
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,679
rubber bands are the best way to do that

852
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,760
for me another evolution is materials

853
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
this one you can get into the high-end

854
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
stuff and i'm actually going to advocate

855
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,919
that you don't or at least that's what i

856
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,960
prefer

857
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,600
cardboard and glue is cheap and it's

858
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,679
easy to work with

859
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,120
and the surprising thing is it's

860
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,440
actually mock capable you can fly a

861
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
cardboard tube above the speed of sound

862
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
and if you've built it well it will not

863
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
tear itself apart

864
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
for me that's good enough especially

865
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,320
since i'm flying kind of middle grade

866
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
motors but for some people it's not if

867
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,039
you really want to fly the big motors if

868
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,880
you want to fly really fast

869
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,399
you're going to need fiberglass and

870
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,960
epoxy it's strong

871
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,519
but it's messy and you can fly to high

872
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,320
mock

873
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,080
there's even a couple other more exotic

874
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,399
materials like blue tube

875
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,360
blue tube is essentially a vulcanized or

876
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,720
rubberized

877
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,159
tube that you can hit something like a

878
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,159
baseball bat with it and it just won't

879
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,200
deform

880
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,919
so if you want a rocket that's really

881
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,519
super recoverable that's another great

882
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,720
material but

883
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
all of these are kind of more exotic

884
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,399
materials a lot a lot more expensive a

885
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,000
lot harder to work with

886
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
for me i'm going to tend to stay more

887
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
toward the cardboard and glue

888
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,559
and glue here is really just the old

889
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,760
wood glue

890
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,120
same stuff you know your your parents

891
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,360
probably had in a cabinet somewhere

892
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
it's typically stronger than the

893
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,720
cardboard itself and that's all you need

894
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,440
if the cardboard can fly at mach 1 then

895
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,240
soak in the glue

896
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,480
another evolution is software this is

897
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,200
a program called open rocket uh it's

898
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
java based you can actually model out

899
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,640
your rockets

900
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,679
uh the rocket here is uh one that

901
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,200
you probably shouldn't fly this is more

902
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,279
of a oops a bit more of a thought

903
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,120
experiment of

904
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
i have a rocket that looks like this

905
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,799
what would happen if i just throw the

906
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,960
biggest engine i possibly could in it

907
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,240
well in this case it's going to go

908
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,039
7 000 feet in the air and it's going to

909
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
reach mach 2.0

910
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
um considering this is a cardboard

911
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
rocket i'm not sure it would survive

912
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,000
that but

913
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,640
it's a lot a lot better than actually

914
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
loading it up

915
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,519
and causing a big explosion or you know

916
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
having my my rocket fail in the middle

917
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,559
of the sky and

918
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
embarrass me at least now i know what it

919
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
is um

920
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,440
really the the better benefits here are

921
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
um it helps you stay within the bounds

922
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,279
of your field and the law

923
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,799
so for instance my field here in dallas

924
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,960
there's an altitude limit and if we have

925
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
to keep our rockets under that limit

926
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,559
per faa regulations then

927
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,000
we know we have to know how high they're

928
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
going to go and you have to know which

929
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
engines

930
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,120
would exceed that limit and you can

931
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,080
model those

932
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,799
in here and figure out where what

933
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,360
altitude approximately would it go to

934
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,000
another real benefit is understanding

935
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,640
the wind

936
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,760
you can put the wind speed in here and

937
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
you can figure out if i shoot this

938
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,039
rocket up

939
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
how far is it going to float you know

940
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,559
it's going to have so long in the air

941
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,919
with a certain wind speed

942
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,159
and assuming it goes straight up which

943
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,760
is a bit of an assumption but let's just

944
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,000
say

945
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
hypothetically you know within a margin

946
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,919
of error i'm going to figure out that

947
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,440
this thing's going to float

948
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,039
you know a mile a half mile whatever

949
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,039
whatever the the reality would be and

950
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,880
then see is that going to keep it within

951
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
my field or am i going to be

952
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
blasting it onto somebody else's

953
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,440
property and probably losing my rocket

954
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
lastly it helps you calculate the

955
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
stability and

956
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,040
some of the other factors about whether

957
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,639
your rocket's safe

958
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,440
so the blue here is your center of

959
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,079
gravity

960
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,879
and the red dot is your center of drag

961
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,079
and you always want your center of

962
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,159
gravity to be in front of

963
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,599
the center of drag otherwise the drag

964
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,320
will

965
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,639
turn your rocket over so if i had big

966
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
fins on the front

967
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
of course nobody builds rockets that way

968
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,839
because it'd be pretty dumb thing to do

969
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,639
then the drag on those front fins is

970
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,199
going to

971
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,918
drag my rocket sideways because the

972
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,639
center of gravity would be behind it

973
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
very important to know to have safe

974
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
rockets another metric that this helps

975
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,639
you track is how fast will it be going

976
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,159
off the launch pad

977
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,040
so that i can have an appropriate speed

978
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
where the drag on the fins is keeping it

979
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
straight

980
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
if it's not going fast enough you and

981
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
there's a side wind

982
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,359
oftentimes you can get what's called

983
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,880
weather cocking and your rocket can

984
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
start to go sideways and that can cause

985
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,280
you to

986
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,000
fly off the field as well so really cool

987
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,119
things you can do with this free

988
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,560
software

989
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,359
or just invent your own rockets kind of

990
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,079
model out

991
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,359
what would be safe what wouldn't

992
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,839
if you want to go do this there's a

993
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
couple great organizations to get to

994
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,200
know

995
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,280
the biggest one is national association

996
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
of rocketry gnar

997
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,599
there's 195 chapters we have a great one

998
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
here in dallas

999
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
there's a 5 million dollar insurance

1000
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,119
limit

1001
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,000
i personally i'm not cared too much

1002
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,599
about the insurance limits because i'm

1003
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,640
trying very hard not to go injure myself

1004
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
but both organizations do carry

1005
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
insurance

1006
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,280
also the big difference is commercial

1007
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,040
motors only

1008
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,400
in gnar and i'll get to that in a second

1009
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,920
um but just also just in terms of the

1010
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
the culture of the organizations nar is

1011
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
great for beginners

1012
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,640
it's great for people who are willing to

1013
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,160
go buy the equipment to do it right um

1014
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
and safely they prioritize safety above

1015
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
all else

1016
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
now i think both organizations are very

1017
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
safe but tripoli rocket association is a

1018
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,440
little more

1019
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,160
uh pushing the edge they're they're not

1020
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,000
as popular in the sense that there's not

1021
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,599
as many clubs around around the country

1022
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,359
around the world

1023
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,560
they have a little bit less on the

1024
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
insurance limit but they allow

1025
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,839
experimental motors

1026
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,920
which if you're into that sort of thing

1027
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,880
is is fun you can actually go

1028
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
legally cook up your own rocket motor

1029
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,359
in a safe way and and take an oxidizer

1030
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,000
and

1031
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
what's being burned with that oxidizer

1032
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,240
and put it all together and

1033
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
if you're in tripoli you can bring it to

1034
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,160
their launches and uh presuming the rest

1035
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,440
of the rockets safe they'll let you

1036
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
launch it and it's all perfectly legal

1037
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
um also just in terms of the culture uh

1038
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
tripoli is geared a little more toward

1039
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,920
big bigger kids bigger toys

1040
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,160
a lot of bigger sport rockets and not as

1041
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
much of the small stuff

1042
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
if you have a young kid and you want to

1043
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,040
take them out to go shoot rockets

1044
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
either organization is good but gnar is

1045
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,160
probably your better cultural fit if you

1046
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,119
want to go

1047
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,960
drop a couple hundred bucks and go shoot

1048
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
some big rockets i would go with tripoli

1049
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,200
either way one of the big benefits is

1050
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,560
you're gonna get to hang out with people

1051
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
shooting their rockets and when you get

1052
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,160
into these bigger motors

1053
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
that can cost 20 30 40 or

1054
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,599
all the way up to a couple thousand i

1055
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,960
kind of want to let somebody else pay

1056
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,599
for that

1057
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,240
and um so i'll go out and take my rocket

1058
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,640
spend

1059
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,480
you know 10 or 20 bucks launch and then

1060
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,200
go watch some yahoo with deeper pockets

1061
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,480
than me go launch

1062
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
two thousand dollar motor and enjoy the

1063
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,160
sport at his expense

1064
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,800
so that's what i have on the rocket side

1065
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,640
hopefully uh i hope you enjoyed it

1066
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,720
uh go out and fly rocket they're a lot

1067
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
of fun

1068
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
since i do have a couple minutes if i

1069
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
could i would like to

1070
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,280
go ahead and share one of my favorite

1071
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
rockets

1072
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,839
this is an estes ascender um different

1073
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,599
makers out there these days but a couple

1074
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
things that i like about this one

1075
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,280
first it's a pretty decent sized little

1076
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,359
rocket it's about three feet long

1077
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,800
two and a half inches diameter um

1078
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
one of the tech the more minor technical

1079
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,560
changes is

1080
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
these have screw-on engine mounts this

1081
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,920
one's plastic

1082
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,560
they they do make aluminum it's actually

1083
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,119
got a

1084
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,440
old spent composite motor left in there

1085
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
one other great thing about this rocket

1086
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,119
though is just the diameter

1087
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,280
because the parachute releases i was

1088
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
talking about before

1089
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
that's what one of those looks like and

1090
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,960
they're a little too big for the tiny

1091
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,680
rockets

1092
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,160
so this rocket is big enough that i can

1093
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
fit the parachute release in

1094
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,640
comfortably so when this rocket pops out

1095
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
it's got a nylon parachute a little more

1096
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,800
durable than the old plastic stuff

1097
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,040
and the chute release fits around it

1098
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,240
just like that

1099
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,960
and you have this little rubber band

1100
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
some people actually use rubber bands

1101
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
technically the company sells

1102
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,800
you know fancy more durable ones and it

1103
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,119
just

1104
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,000
loops around the parachute and you stuff

1105
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,720
it back in the rocket

1106
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
the other thing i like about this rocket

1107
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
is just the size

1108
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,079
it uses 29 millimeter engine mounts

1109
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,359
which are

1110
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,119
a size that you can get ef and g

1111
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,680
motors in fairly inexpensive so you can

1112
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,119
shoot that whole range with this one

1113
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,320
rocket

1114
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
it'll fall down and pretty reliably

1115
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
return the rocket to you

1116
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,640
the whole thing costs about 50 bucks

1117
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
retail

1118
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,680
you can get engines for this for about

1119
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,040
10 bucks

1120
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,880
the shoot release runs about 100 150

1121
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,200
so you know all in with the shoot

1122
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,079
release

1123
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,280
to get into the sport you're looking

1124
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,839
about 200 bucks

1125
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,599
you can go less without the shoot

1126
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,200
release obviously that's about half of

1127
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,880
your cost

1128
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,280
and and either way mostly i just

1129
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
don't want to spend all day chasing down

1130
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
my my rockets that are floated away so

1131
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
i'd rather spend the hundred bucks for

1132
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
the shoot release but

1133
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,240
it's all great tech and it's all fairly

1134
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
new this this whole shoot release

1135
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
it's only been on the market for about

1136
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,599
uh five uh

1137
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,880
five to ten years now before that

1138
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
uh the whole delayed uh

1139
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
delayed release of the parachute was a

1140
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
pretty expensive proposition that was

1141
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,560
only used by the big guys but

1142
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,160
now you can go buy one of these things

1143
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,599
uh and be flying

1144
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
within a week so uh hopefully you guys

1145
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,319
enjoyed that and uh

1146
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,040
enjoy shooting some rockets and i'll

1147
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,079
stop and open up for any questions

1148
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,319
awesome thank you so much for your uh

1149
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,680
for your time and attention to this

1150
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,480
topic uh

1151
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
it's been a lot of fun watching it i

1152
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,760
just uh

1153
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,359
just wanted to clarify one little thing

1154
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,760
you had that slide earlier giving the

1155
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,119
uh the specific impulse of rocket motors

1156
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,599
uh do you think you could put this into

1157
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,319
context

1158
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,079
as to like how big or how heavy a rocket

1159
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,079
uh the yeah that your your preferred

1160
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,920
range is you know how how heavy are

1161
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,160
those

1162
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,079
sure so um there's calculations in it

1163
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,560
all

1164
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
uh this rocket that i have that flies

1165
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,760
comfortably on e-motors

1166
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
it's in the neighborhood of about half a

1167
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,520
pound

1168
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,240
total weight you can certainly go a

1169
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,760
little higher a little lower

1170
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,839
really the best thing here is to throw

1171
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,800
it in the simulators and figure out

1172
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
just how high it would go given the

1173
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,880
components when you're building it

1174
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
throw it on a scale figure out what the

1175
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,480
actual weight is put that into the

1176
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
software and then it'll tell you how

1177
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,960
high

1178
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,319
how high it'll go if it will go at all

1179
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,920
but generally a g-motor

1180
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,599
you can be launching rockets that are

1181
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,960
you know four feet tall

1182
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,000
and four inches in diameter and weigh

1183
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,240
you know two to three pounds pretty

1184
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,760
comfortably

1185
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
and for me that's you know that's my fun

1186
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
level

1187
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,680
at my club here in dallas uh we have

1188
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,520
launched rockets you know seven inches

1189
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,319
in diameter

1190
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,839
and eight feet tall and uh one fun thing

1191
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,280
is it's been little elementary kids

1192
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
who've come out and done it and you so

1193
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,240
you see the rocket and

1194
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,480
uh it's three times higher than the kid

1195
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,760
pressing the button to launch it so

1196
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,440
that's also a lot of fun

1197
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,000
um any anybody can really uh do the math

1198
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,040
and get into it that way

1199
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,160
awesome uh

1200
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,560
in the channel we have a question uh do

1201
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,079
you have any tips for people who would

1202
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,839
want to get into this but live in an

1203
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:54,319
urban

1204
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,480
setting yes um

1205
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,240
a lot of the rocket clubs uh will have

1206
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,839
launch sites so for instance here in

1207
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,480
dallas um it's a whole

1208
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,440
dallas area rocket society which is a

1209
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,800
member of nar

1210
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,560
they coordinate launch sites and they

1211
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,319
will go out as a club

1212
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,400
and find a field somewhere relatively

1213
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
close to go shoot at so the one we have

1214
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
is about an hour north of dallas for the

1215
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,359
big field

1216
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,520
they also have some smaller fields that

1217
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,920
are 20 minutes away from the city center

1218
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,200
where you can shoot some of the low

1219
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,480
power stuff

1220
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
so definitely recommend going and

1221
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,000
finding a club because they've probably

1222
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,200
already answered that question

1223
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,960
all right fantastic uh well i don't see

1224
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
any other questions coming up

1225
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,720
