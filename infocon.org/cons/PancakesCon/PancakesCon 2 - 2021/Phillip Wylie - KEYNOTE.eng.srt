29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199

you need to have registered in the ctf

188
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680

236
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
theme

237
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,479
uh that resonates with all of us thanks

238
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
to these virtual conferences

239
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
like this has given us something to do

240
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,440
you know otherwise

241
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
what we would be doing with all the cam

242
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
the conferences canceled all the

243
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
different cyber security meetups what

244
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
would we do in our spare time i am

245
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
i know we would be really bored so

246
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
fortunately uh

247
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
this was one of the things i had to keep

248
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
me sane in

249
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
2020 and continues in 2021 so

250
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
great to be here so my topics today is

251
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
pen testing experience and how to get it

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,599
and health hacking

253
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
so leslie introduced me but this is just

254
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
kind of a little overview

255
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
of me uh my certifications are the cissp

256
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,679
oscp and the sans gw apt

257
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
certification and just kind of little

258
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
you know

259
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
advice or input on the certification

260
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
you don't necessarily have to be

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
certified to be a pen tester although it

262
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,519
does help

263
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
it's better to have than not to have

264
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
just like degrees

265
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
you know some companies are not

266
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
requiring a four-year degree now

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
but you know still it's good it's good

268
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
to have so it just depends on you

269
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
the company you're interviewing with so

270
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,640
uh

271
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
helping people get started in pen

272
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,959
testing is kind of one of my specialties

273
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,519
and you know like this really started

274
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
prior to me becoming a teacher because i

275
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,920
teach

276
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
ethical hacking at dallas college been

277
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
doing that for

278
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
three years as a january

279
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,600
and so prior to that i was sharing

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
information with people mentoring people

281
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
helping people

282
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
get started as pen testers so this is

283
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
kind of one of my one of my specialties

284
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
over my career in my life i'm a i'm a

285
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
competitive power lifter

286
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
and i've always been kind of competitive

287
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
i've worked in cells and always tried to

288
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
be

289
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you know have the top sells was always

290
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
competitive and stuff and then

291
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
you know as you get older it's kind of

292
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
harder to compete in powerlifting i used

293
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,399
to compete in the open division

294
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
competing against any age group

295
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
and one of the my favorite competitions

296
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
which i won

297
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
in 2007 was the drug-free world

298
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,800
championship so powerlifting

299
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
my competitor was like 10 years younger

300
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,839
than me and he saw my age and says wow

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,040
you look good for your age

302
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,839
so it made it even more of a thrill to

303
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,519
beat him in the competition

304
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,760
so all that competitiveness over the

305
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
years and stuff

306
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
was just kind of really driving me and

307
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,720
it's hard to keep

308
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
up you know as you get older it's hard

309
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
to stay up late learning different

310
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
hacking techniques

311
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,279
you know it gets more difficult to get

312
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,720
older to do things so i kind of realized

313
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
with powerlifting i competed my age

314
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
group and then you know

315
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
i realized that the world needs coaches

316
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
and mentors you know sometimes this is

317
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
the area that people overlook you know

318
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
everyone wants to be the rock star the

319
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
the ninja hacker but i just kind of

320
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
settled in with this is my strength and

321
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
this is the area that's needed help

322
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
others get started

323
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
and so this is one of my passions i love

324
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
speaking at conferences

325
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
about becoming a pen tester this is how

326
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
my pen tester blueprint book came about

327
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,959
it was an inspiration of that book it

328
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,720
started out as a lecture the first day

329
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
of my class

330
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,399
i basically outlined the students you

331
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,920
know what a pentester was and how to

332
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
become a pen tester

333
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
some of the other professors in the

334
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
college i taught at our teach at

335
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
asked me to present to their students

336
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
so this you know the very first time i

337
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
gave the talk was in january 2018 when i

338
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,440
first started teaching

339
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
and by november 2018

340
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
i presented the talk at uh the b-sides

341
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,839
dallas-fort worth conference here local

342
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,200
to me

343
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
and so the the talk i've gave since then

344
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,959
and then became a book

345
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
so this is an area i'm passionate about

346
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
and today our focus is more

347
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
about how to get experience in pen

348
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
testing just like in

349
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
a lot of other areas of cyber security

350
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
it's hard to get jobs without experience

351
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,600
but the one thing is

352
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,320
about offensive security we have a lot

353
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,519
of opportunities here

354
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,440
some other areas don't have and we're

355
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,160
going to discuss those

356
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
so to kind of share with you my my

357
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
offensive security path and even before

358
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
the sysadmin i got interested in

359
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
and being a cis admin from being a cad

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,880
drafter

361
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
i was doing autocad and i worked for

362
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,920
places that

363
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
worked for an architect i worked for a

364
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
company that made steel frame buildings

365
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
i worked for a company

366
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
that that did electronic security

367
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
systems for prisons

368
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
uh let's see i worked for um

369
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
a company that made fiber great uh

370
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,120
infrastructure for

371
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
areas they couldn't that that metal was

372
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
too corrosive to be in those

373
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
environments so

374
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
during that time i found out about

375
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
sysadmin work and it seemed a lot more

376
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,320
interesting and during that time i

377
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
taught myself how to build computers

378
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,639
and also took a nobel network network

379
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,000
operating system course

380
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
some people may have not heard of that

381
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
but back like in

382
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
the time i got into it back in the late

383
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
90s

384
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,880
uh novel netware was the popular

385
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,399
network operating system so uh

386
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
that was very popular so i took a 90-day

387
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,440
course

388
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
it's a certification course for the uh

389
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
the cne certification and then i got my

390
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,480
first job

391
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,519
on a netware 4-1-1 windows 95 rollout

392
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
and so i started as assist admin and

393
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
as what i've done through my career is i

394
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,399
went into areas that was interesting to

395
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,040
me

396
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,920
so i did the sysadmin thing i've been

397
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,639
doing

398
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
that role for about six years i got

399
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,360
interested in in cyber security

400
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,399
so in 2004 after about six years of

401
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
being a sysadmin i moved into

402
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,360
the network security team at the time in

403
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,320
the organization

404
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,880
we were we were doing the same thing

405
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
everyone did network security everyone

406
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,200
did

407
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
intrusion detection everyone did

408
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
firewall administration we did

409
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
risk assessments we did some

410
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
vulnerability scanning

411
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,279
and the cso came into the company he

412
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,959
divided us up into different areas

413
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
so i got put into application security

414
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
and application security is where i

415
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
found out about pen testing

416
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,920
we were using appscan to do our web

417
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
application vulnerability scans

418
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
i got to go to different vendor talks on

419
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
their products

420
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,399
and i found out about pen testing so

421
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
this was really

422
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,560
uh you know i've seen that was something

423
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,440
i want to do so

424
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,480
in 2012 i got laid off from my job of 14

425
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
years

426
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,079
and through that experiences in

427
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
application security i realized that

428
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,639
pen testing is what i want to do next so

429
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,680
one of the things i want you to pay

430
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,000
attention to here

431
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
look at my background and i became a pen

432
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,920
tester so i interviewed for a job with

433
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,560
the company

434
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
consulting as a pen tester and i got the

435
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,560
job how i got the job

436
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,079
was my enthusiasm and passion that i

437
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,440
displayed for the hiring manager on

438
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
how passionate i was about learning and

439
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
how passionate i was about pen testing

440
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,399
how i wanted to

441
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
get into that role i told him about my

442
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
home lab that's something to remember

443
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
here

444
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
so he saw my passion willingness to

445
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,000
learn

446
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
and that i had a home lab and this was

447
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
enough for him to hire me so i really

448
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,959
wasn't

449
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
i really didn't have the qualifications

450
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,639
per se for that

451
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
that role i had the background

452
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,079
technology wise but i didn't have the

453
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,279
pen testing piece

454
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
i'd run some vulnerability scanners but

455
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
he he took a chance on me and this was

456
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,440
because

457
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
like i said my passion and i had a home

458
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
lab so kind of remember these things

459
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,240
when you're

460
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,079
you know trying to get into your next

461
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,199
role or trying to get into your pen

462
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
testing job

463
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,279
so what is pen testing so a lot of you

464
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
here probably know but we're going to go

465
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,399
through kind of my descript

466
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
how i describe it uh pen testing is

467
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,240
assessing security from an adversarial

468
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,519
perspective

469
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,320
using hacking tools and techniques also

470
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,519
known as ethical hacking

471
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,680
so ethical hacking is an easier way to

472
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,800
to

473
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
explain to people pen testing because a

474
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,480
lot of times

475
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
over my career people ask me what do you

476
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,279
do for a living you tell them i'm a

477
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
penetration tester they have no idea

478
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
what

479
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,959
that means so ethical hacker just kind

480
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,279
of sums it up a little bit better

481
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
so that's one of the the terms it's

482
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
referred to

483
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
so the experience you need as a pen

484
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,839
tester some of the things you're going

485
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,720
to need here

486
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,959
uh and this is this is assuming that

487
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,759
you've got

488
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
a background in you know understanding

489
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
networking

490
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
uh understanding operating systems you

491
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,399
know even if you

492
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,399
understand applications so one of the

493
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,600
things about

494
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
getting into pen testing is leverage

495
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
your background of things you know

496
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,320
how to do so you may think

497
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
you know red team sounds interesting but

498
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
if you're a developer your pivot point

499
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,240
in

500
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
is going to be web app pen testing

501
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,600
because you've been a developer you

502
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
understand that area

503
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,519
a lot better and so you know that's a

504
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,040
good way to start once you get into pen

505
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
testing you can move into different

506
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,800
areas

507
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
and you can specialize as well so the

508
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
tools you need to know

509
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
the experience that you need and these

510
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
can be and we're going to discuss some

511
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
ways you can get this experience

512
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
even without an actual pen testing job

513
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
is you need to know vulnerability

514
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,839
scanners like nessus

515
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
and nexpose then openvox is a free one

516
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,839
you can get like a free

517
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,120
version of nessus nessus essentials so

518
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,639
you know set up your home lab and use

519
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,959
nessus essentials to scan your network

520
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,519
because

521
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,199
once you learn nessus essentials you'll

522
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
be able to use nessus professional

523
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
and that's widely used in consulting in

524
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,199
a lot of different

525
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,279
organizations so that's a good one to

526
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,800
know once you learn

527
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
nessus then you can learn qualis or

528
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
rapid sevens nexposed

529
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
so pin testing distros like kali linux

530
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,319
and peritos

531
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
you can install tools on on ubuntu using

532
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
the pen tester framework

533
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,079
but one of the things i like about kali

534
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
linux and parrot os

535
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,160
those tools are pre-installed or easily

536
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,799
installed

537
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,799
some times trying to install them from

538
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,079
scratch can be

539
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,919
you know can be troublesome and not work

540
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,280
out for you so

541
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
sticking with those distributions is

542
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
good uh pin testing tools

543
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,280
just to name a couple you know that

544
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
you'll really need a lot of experience

545
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
with is nmap and metasploit

546
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
but there's a lot of other tools that

547
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
come on kali linux and paired os

548
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
that you need to learn how to use and

549
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
and learn to use a variety of tools

550
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
don't just be dependent on just one

551
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,480
and so you know as you are learning

552
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
these tools these are things that you

553
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,039
can that you can

554
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,000
use when you're going through an

555
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
interview these are some skills that you

556
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
can put on your resume

557
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,039
so what about pen testing tools like

558
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
burp suite a wasps app and different web

559
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
application vulnerability scanners

560
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,640
like acunetix appscan and web inspect

561
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
are some popular ones to just name name

562
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
a few so knowing these are important so

563
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,400
when i was getting in

564
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
uh this was like one of the areas that i

565
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
had some experience with i knew linux

566
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,320
and i had experience with vulnerability

567
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,799
scanners

568
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,240
and so skills so networking and

569
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
operating systems

570
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,679
windows and linux so these these uh

571
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,440
operating system skills

572
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,400
you need at a sysadmin level so you need

573
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,160
to be able to understand this

574
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
like a sysadmin and why you need those

575
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,320
functions is if you get

576
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
a shell or command line to your target

577
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,240
system

578
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,799
then if you can shut down the firewall

579
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
or run different commands do

580
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
administrative

581
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,840
tasks then it's going to make your job a

582
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
lot easier if you don't understand the

583
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
operating system

584
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
and you get a shell to a system you're

585
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,799
going to be doing a lot of googling

586
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,440
which

587
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
you know there's cases that that's

588
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
needed and you will do that because it's

589
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
impossible to know everything

590
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
and so but you want that base level of

591
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,160
knowledge and

592
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,840
uh like i said you get that get get

593
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,640
command line access or shell to a system

594
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
be able to navigate that's going to be

595
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,760
very helpful knowing the different linux

596
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
and windows commands knowing powershell

597
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,240
and then hacking and pin testing

598
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
experience so these are these are

599
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
helpful so when i started my career

600
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,919
this was the area i was missing the

601
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
hacking and pen testing

602
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
so one of the first things i did i was

603
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
doing some research before i started the

604
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
job

605
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
there's verizon that i went to work for

606
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
and prior to getting the job

607
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
there was they were acquiring

608
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,240
teramark which is a cloud host a cloud

609
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
hosting company

610
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
and so they're requiring that company

611
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
and so put off the hiring process so i

612
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
talked them in november

613
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
and didn't get to go to work until march

614
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,679
so i did some research and i found some

615
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,559
courses

616
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,240
and one of the first ones i found and

617
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
and certifications it was really

618
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,880
respected

619
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
was the oscp and so i knew this was a

620
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
way to learn how to hack so i started

621
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
taking oscp so that's where i got those

622
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,039
skills

623
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
and then reverse engineering these are

624
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,799
really good skills to have because if

625
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,440
you

626
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
you know you get a java jar file or some

627
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
other compiled code if you can decompile

628
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
it you may be able to find

629
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,799
hard coded credentials in there and get

630
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
access to the system i've done numerous

631
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,559
pen tests where

632
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,880
it may not have been a web app pen test

633
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
and found like a java jar

634
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
file or you know even an apk file for a

635
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,520
mobile

636
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,039
mobile device and was able to reverse

637
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,360
engineer it and get credentials

638
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,960
and a really good pen tester for my

639
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
local community and

640
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
actually leslie knows as well he was one

641
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
of the people responsible for figuring

642
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
out how to hack the door lock that her

643
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
former landlord wanting to wanted to put

644
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
all the tenants door locks

645
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
uh chase dartmouth he started out as a

646
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
reverse engineer so these skills you

647
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,919
have knowing how to code

648
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
knowing how to reverse engineer these

649
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
are very helpful in in pen testing

650
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
and even coding is good skills although

651
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
you don't need the coding skills

652
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,720
to get started as a pen tester it's very

653
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
helpful bill right here on scripts

654
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,919
when you see some of these people that

655
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,760
are really really sharp individuals in

656
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
the industry just like

657
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,159
a bite bleeder that works for black

658
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,000
hills information security group

659
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
you know he wrote the crack map exec

660
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
tool and so

661
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
these people like that can write tools

662
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,159
that there may have not been something

663
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,600
to do what they needed to do and they

664
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,000
create

665
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
it so you know start out learning how to

666
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
script and then you can get into

667
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,559
full-blown coding

668
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,760
but you don't necessarily have to have

669
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,039
that experience that you're starting pin

670
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,000
testing so don't

671
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
wait to master coding before you get

672
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
started

673
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
so how to get experience so this is the

674
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,679
the probably the

675
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,159
part that most people are interested in

676
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,039
and one of the

677
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
things uh that i've been recommending

678
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
over the years and when i started

679
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,960
teaching

680
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
you know i was trying to think of ways

681
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,960
how could my students get experience

682
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
because that's a lot of the biggest

683
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
factor you know if you're if you're in

684
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
college

685
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
make sure to go through an internship

686
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
program if you get an internship

687
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,159
you're gonna have a lot better chance

688
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
getting hired on full-time sometimes

689
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
through the employer you do your

690
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,000
internship through

691
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and sometimes just having that 90 days

692
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
experience now you have experience where

693
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,520
you didn't

694
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
so i would was sharing different ways

695
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,640
with my students and and i've you know

696
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,919
i've been sharing about bug bounty i

697
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,760
found out about bug bounties because

698
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
i'd followed jason haddock's you know

699
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,240
for years i followed him on twitter

700
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
and i saw some of the different cool

701
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
techniques he used he was you know he

702
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
started out as a pen tester

703
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
and then went to work for bug crowd and

704
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,400
did a lot of stuff for bug bounty

705
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,280
community

706
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,039
uh education showing people how to do

707
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,159
certain things and just following some

708
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
of the cool techniques that he had

709
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,400
was helpful on my web app pen tests and

710
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
so when bug crowd started their

711
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,280
ambassador program

712
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
i saw that as an opportunity i could

713
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
learn more about bug bounty

714
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
i could learn how to do the bug bounties

715
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,840
and how to share that with the people i

716
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,400
mentor

717
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
teach and and speak to at conferences

718
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,080
so that was one of the one of the

719
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
recommendations i made and

720
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,320
i got kind of affirmation to that

721
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,679
confirmation to that

722
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
back last summer when i was interviewing

723
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
for jobs i interviewed with a

724
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
a very well known boutique pen testing

725
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
firm and the hiring manager told me that

726
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,960
it was easier for him to find web app

727
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,120
pen testers because of bug bounty

728
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
so this is not to discourage you of

729
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
trying to get into web app pen testing

730
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,000
this just means that

731
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
that's a known way and that that hiring

732
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
manager respects that

733
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
and so he sees someone with bug bounty

734
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
experience

735
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,840
then that's gonna be someone he'd be

736
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
interested in interviewing and possibly

737
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,440
hiring so bug bounties

738
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,799
uh if you're not familiar bug bounties

739
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,559
i'm sure you've heard of them but

740
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,919
it's basically a crowd-sourced pen test

741
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
so instead of having one person testing

742
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
an application you could have tens or

743
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
hundreds of thousands

744
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
of people testing one app and pen tests

745
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,200
are really limited by the number of

746
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,520
times

747
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,080
the amount of time you have to test so

748
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,720
if you have

749
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
a lot of testers then you're going to

750
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,000
uncover things that you may not other

751
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
otherwise be able to test a typical web

752
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,559
application you may have 40 hours

753
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,360
to do the pen test and write the report

754
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,400
whereas with you know

755
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
a bug bounty you've got like a of you

756
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
know a lot of people

757
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,440
putting in a lot of hours in a short

758
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
period of time so so this is one of

759
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,960
those things even good to include with

760
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,520
your

761
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,279
your pen testing and some companies also

762
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,880
have bug bounty programs

763
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,159
in addition to their pen testing

764
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
programs and

765
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,360
when you get the experience with bug

766
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
bounty you can also get to do

767
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
pen tests through them like hacker one

768
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,520
and bug crowd they also offer pen tests

769
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
outside of the bug bounty which

770
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,919
bug bounty you're paid for the bugs you

771
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
find the vulnerabilities

772
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
whereas pin testing you're paid for the

773
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
pen test

774
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
and that was one of the hardest things

775
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,799
for me to really get too involved into

776
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
bug bounty was because i can do side pen

777
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,080
tests

778
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
and i get paid for my efforts whereas

779
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,159
bug bound you don't but bug body is good

780
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
because you get the experience

781
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,679
but these companies offer like bug crowd

782
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
has their next gen pen test where they

783
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,880
perform a pen test

784
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
and a bug bounty at the same time and so

785
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,279
i got to do one of the very

786
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
first ones and kind of helped be an

787
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
ambassador for bug crowd

788
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,559
and so it was a really cool process it

789
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
was like a 30 hours

790
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,120
or so that you pen tested and made 1500

791
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
which is really good money

792
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
for someone starting out as you get

793
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
experience you can make more money

794
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
so as you do this get that experience

795
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,919
you're able to go interview somewhere

796
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,679
else and work go to work full time as a

797
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,799
pen tester

798
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,600
so hacker one and blood crab both offer

799
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
these pen tests

800
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
typically if you have pen testing

801
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,520
experience you can interview and get

802
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
into that process but

803
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,640
if you're not start out with the bug

804
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
bounties as they see you progressing

805
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,279
and you'll get invited to private bug

806
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,559
bounties where you have an opportunity

807
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,200
to make

808
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,559
a better opportunity to make money

809
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,799
because there's less people on the bug

810
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,520
bounties

811
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,039
you also get invited to do these pen

812
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,559
tests so once you get that pen test

813
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
experience you got that

814
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,720
and so you have like these companies

815
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,600
that are kind of

816
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
described themselves as pen test as a

817
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
service

818
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
so like cobalt and synack and these are

819
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
a little more difficult to get in

820
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
doesn't necessarily mean you have to

821
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,520
have experience but with like synac

822
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,279
if you go to uh to hack the box

823
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,000
they have the dante challenge as well as

824
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,400
the

825
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,600
uh the synack red team track that you go

826
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,480
through there

827
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
and then that gets you kind of expedited

828
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,840
to get interviewed sooner with synac

829
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,279
so this is like you're not having a

830
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,960
professional experience

831
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,159
just the experience you're getting in

832
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
these labs and then like cobalt

833
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
you interview with them they give you a

834
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
technical challenge they'll give you

835
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
like a vulnerable application

836
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
to do a pen test against to get your

837
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,679
skill level and then that gets you in

838
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,600
into the interview process and get you

839
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,039
in there so once you're doing the

840
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
the pen test phase like do bug crowd or

841
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,559
doing this through cobalt

842
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,440
and synac then you're getting

843
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,120
transferable experience to become a pen

844
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
tester you know this may take

845
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
you know a year or so depending on you

846
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,919
and and

847
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
you know your how well you do

848
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,039
interviewing and

849
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,600
and uh getting uh approached by

850
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,320
recruiters

851
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,360
but after you do this for all you're

852
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
getting experience as you're doing this

853
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,360
uh you also get to um as you do you're

854
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,559
getting experience so

855
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,840
the things you gain from experience you

856
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,880
can be able to do on a technical

857
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,679
interview

858
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
like with the web app pen testing stuff

859
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,120
you're always going to get asked

860
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
whether it's web app pen testing or not

861
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440
you're going to get asked

862
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
questions from the os top 10 so know

863
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,799
those know those

864
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
vulnerabilities and know how to

865
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,240
remediate those

866
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,919
and so that's going to help you an

867
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,520
interview the stuff you learn

868
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
from the bug bounties and uh the

869
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,600
pentastic like cobalt

870
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
and synac is going to help give you

871
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
experience so you can you can describe

872
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,679
your methodology you use the different

873
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
tools you're able to describe that to

874
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,799
the hiring manager

875
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,919
so these are things that's going to help

876
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,960
you get a chance to get in and get a job

877
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
so other areas and these are ways to

878
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,640
build your hacking skills

879
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
ctfs hack the box try hack me

880
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
uh home labs using vulnerable vms you

881
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,360
can go to vault hub download some

882
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
vulnerable vms from there

883
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,679
pro bono pen testing for non-profits so

884
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,480
ctfs

885
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
you know like here in a lot of other

886
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,960
conferences they host ctfs and some

887
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,679
companies

888
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,799
will even like raytheon ran a ctf

889
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,919
at i believe besides austin a few years

890
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,720
ago one of

891
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,279
our really good pen testers and hackers

892
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
from our local community

893
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,720
solved it in a pretty quick time and i

894
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
think the part of the

895
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
goal of them running the ctf was to try

896
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,919
to recruit talent

897
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,399
so ctfs at conferences it's a good way

898
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,200
to get noticed

899
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
if you're in college do national cyber

900
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
league because they have like a ranking

901
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,679
system

902
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,880
and if you rank highly you'll get

903
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
approached by hiring managers and so all

904
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
these things you're doing you're getting

905
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,159
hacking experience

906
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,640
and then so like try hack me this is a

907
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
little more education based and hack the

908
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,440
box

909
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,720
it's kind of a chat you go in there and

910
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,080
you learn how to hack they've got like

911
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
active directory environments and

912
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,559
so while building a home lab is a good

913
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,640
thing but you can save a lot of time

914
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
and and just depend on someone else's

915
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
skills to build out

916
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,399
a environment to hack in like hack the

917
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
box and try acme

918
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
hack the box is getting a little more

919
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
educational following the lead to try

920
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,039
hack me but try hack me has a lot of

921
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,320
educational stuff to get you up and

922
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,159
running

923
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,080
uh and then the home labs i would

924
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,440
recommend downloading

925
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
metasploitable two and three you need to

926
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,440
know how to hack with linux

927
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
so metasploitable 2 runs on ubuntu and

928
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
metasploitable3 can be run on windows so

929
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,919
you need to be able to hack

930
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,000
in both those environments and so pro

931
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
bono pen testing works so if you know

932
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
any churches or other religious

933
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,440
organizations non-profits

934
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,760
even some small businesses that can't

935
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
afford pentest you know

936
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
you may have relatives own a small

937
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,559
business you can volunteer to do a pen

938
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,760
test for them you know if you have

939
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,799
someone that

940
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
that writes you know android or ios apps

941
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,600
you can pen test those applications to

942
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
get experience through that

943
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
so start out free then maybe you can do

944
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,399
low cost so

945
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,559
once you you're doing pen testing the

946
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,080
pro bono work you're still going to get

947
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,440
the experience but

948
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
once you can maybe start making a little

949
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
money then you're getting paid to do

950
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,000
that so this

951
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,520
shows that you know a little more that

952
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
you're doing it for a job not just the

953
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
skill set but also the professional

954
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,360
experience

955
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,960
and so yeah just to kind of wrap up the

956
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,480
first part of my talk is yeah just

957
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
remember to

958
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,919
you know get those hacking skills do

959
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,440
your ctfs

960
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
uh hack the box try hack me you know as

961
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,600
you're doing that make sure you're

962
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,960
documenting using a

963
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
well-documented methodology the

964
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,039
penetration testing execution standard

965
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,640
is a great reference

966
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
so learn the steps and that write up

967
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
your formal methodology and practice

968
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,080
those methodologies

969
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,000
use like the os testing guide for web

970
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
app pen testing and have that

971
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
methodology down so when you're going

972
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
through that interview you can tell

973
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
someone how you're performing a pen test

974
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,840
because you know methodology is a big

975
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,399
part of that

976
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,200
so the next part of my talk here is

977
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,919
hacking health

978
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,240
so this is really ins this talk inspired

979
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,000
me from uh the pandemic

980
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and just kind of the way i dealt with

981
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,520
things you know it's really hard

982
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
mentally for a lot of people

983
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,880
uh during the pandemic i you know

984
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
we a lot of us where i worked at was

985
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,000
going through some

986
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,840
really stressful times we had a

987
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
management change

988
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
and we made a lot of life really

989
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
stressful for a lot of us

990
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
you know around march we all started

991
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
working from home

992
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,279
and you know i have like a you know

993
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
kind of a bad relationship with food

994
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,320
when

995
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,840
when i was a child like a lot of people

996
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,440
from my generation

997
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,279
my mom would make you know you can't get

998
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,480
up from the table unless you eat all

999
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,200
your food

1000
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,960
so we would sit there and and have to

1001
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
sit at the table to weigh all our food i

1002
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
kind of got better about it because

1003
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,120
you know just an easy way to get out of

1004
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
being in trouble but my poor brother

1005
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
you know he was kind of a smaller kid

1006
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,320
and he just

1007
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
his poor guy would sit there for a long

1008
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,279
time because he just won't get the food

1009
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,399
down and then

1010
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,000
you know i was eating all my food and

1011
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
then my mom would guilt me if i didn't

1012
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,240
eat more

1013
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,960
eat seconds and thirds you know you're

1014
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,399
not gonna eat any more than that and so

1015
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,399
i just kind of got trained to overeat

1016
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,039
and so over the years kind of one of my

1017
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,640
coping mechanisms is food

1018
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,600
if i'm upset or depressed i'll eat if

1019
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
i'm upset sometimes my diet or healthy

1020
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
eating is out the window

1021
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,960
and i just have to learn to adjust and

1022
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,559
get back to that

1023
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
so kind of my health and fitness

1024
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
background is i'm a competitive power

1025
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,039
lifter

1026
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,399
i've been competing since since 1984

1027
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
with some breaks in there i've competed

1028
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,600
like in

1029
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,960
i think something like over 50

1030
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
powerlifting competitions have a world

1031
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
championship i've got

1032
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
i've held state national records i have

1033
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,039
some records that are still in place

1034
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,640
i've competed at the arnold

1035
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,919
sports festival and i've really been

1036
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,600
interested in nutrition

1037
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,279
over the years one of my first nutrition

1038
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,640
books was the

1039
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,159
nutrition almanac and i got interested

1040
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,440
in nutrition when i started lifting

1041
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
weights

1042
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,519
when i was 15. when i was in middle

1043
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,720
school

1044
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
you know i was fairly naturally strong

1045
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,640
but i didn't look like it

1046
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,559
so i we used to go in the weight room

1047
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,840
during uh

1048
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,559
off off-season athletics and just work

1049
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,080
out we would lift you know back then

1050
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,039
kids

1051
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,399
didn't know how to work out we're just

1052
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,720
in the gym you know trying to see how

1053
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,080
much we could lift

1054
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
and no one believed me how much i could

1055
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,760
bench press so over the summer i decided

1056
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
i was gonna start working out

1057
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,159
so uh i would look like i i worked out

1058
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,279
so that's when i got interested in

1059
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,000
nutrition started taking supplements

1060
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,919
you know mainly to to get stronger

1061
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,240
wasn't so much for health at that time

1062
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,320
uh you know protein we had like a

1063
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,640
distributor coming one time and sold

1064
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
protein to our football team

1065
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
and so so that was really kind of my

1066
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,320
experience with nutrition and i read

1067
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
different diet books and followed things

1068
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
like in muscle and fitness magazine

1069
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
trying to learn more about nutrition to

1070
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
be able to get bigger and stronger

1071
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,519
and so that's really where you know that

1072
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
got me interested in

1073
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,399
in diet and exercise

1074
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
and along the way you know kind of uh

1075
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,919
powerlifting has kind of helped me

1076
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
avoid probably some more serious health

1077
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,279
issues

1078
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,240
uh in 2003 i was diagnosed with type 2

1079
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,159
diabetes and a lot of this is a side

1080
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,039
effect of overeating

1081
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
you know towards in when i was married

1082
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
to my first wife i got out of

1083
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,080
working out got overweight and unhealthy

1084
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,200
and then you know took me a while to get

1085
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
back into the gym

1086
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,399
and take care of my health but this

1087
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,119
period of time where i was still eating

1088
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,839
you know these extra calories and stuff

1089
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,639
part of it was

1090
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,918
from being a power lifter but one of the

1091
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,679
things that powerlifting did is it

1092
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,040
allowed me to overeat

1093
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,000
and not put on too much fat and stay

1094
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,119
semi-healthy but once

1095
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,960
i quit you know i went back you know

1096
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,719
before i even lifted

1097
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,760
i was overeating so powerlifting kind of

1098
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
helped and it's it's one that's helped

1099
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
me over the years one thing i know have

1100
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,199
to do

1101
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,119
to continue to stay healthy even in my

1102
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,960
age of 55

1103
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,480
i still have to continue to do that so

1104
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
this kind of helps me in taking

1105
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,679
supplements that kind of help me these

1106
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,040
are things that help my health being

1107
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
worse than what they are

1108
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,918
if i didn't do those things i would

1109
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,560
probably be a lot less healthy than what

1110
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
i am

1111
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,839
so during my career as a power lifter

1112
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,599
back around 2004 i found out about

1113
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,760
ketogenic and low carb diets

1114
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
so i ate low carb diets and prior to

1115
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,880
that when i was

1116
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
to kind of take a step back when i was

1117
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes

1118
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
i kind of did you know what most people

1119
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,440
said to lose weight i just cut

1120
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
calories i ate less fat less carbs

1121
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,040
wasn't really doing particularly low

1122
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
carb but wasn't really doing low fat

1123
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,680
either just kind of cutting back and i

1124
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,000
lost

1125
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
weight i went from starting out probably

1126
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
about 260 or so and then got down about

1127
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
220 pounds and

1128
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
started lifting and one of the things

1129
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
that's been bad about powerlifting for

1130
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,200
me is

1131
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,040
if you want to get stronger get heavier

1132
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,560
and it doesn't matter how you put the

1133
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,119
weight on

1134
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,359
i mean that's just the sad fact about it

1135
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,320
if you put on

1136
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,079
you know 20 pounds you're gonna be able

1137
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
to squat and bench press more

1138
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,359
it just happens you put on weight and

1139
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
you'll put on some muscle may not be all

1140
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
muscle but

1141
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,839
and so over the years i've been careful

1142
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
about losing weight because once i

1143
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,800
started losing weight losing strength

1144
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,280
then

1145
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,640
you know you really didn't like that and

1146
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,320
you'd i'd eventually gained the weight

1147
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
back so keto

1148
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,760
and low carb is what i kind of found out

1149
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,359
through uh

1150
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,880
found through my years of powerlifting

1151
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
for about 2004 and on

1152
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,640
and so for years i've been a natural

1153
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
health enthusiast and nutritional

1154
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,320
supplement enthusiast

1155
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,040
uh you know one of the things from my

1156
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
poor eating over the years

1157
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,160
probably the first health issue i had

1158
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,400
was in 97 i had gout

1159
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
something i still will deal with today

1160
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,599
and that was because my overeating in

1161
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,400
the

1162
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,880
the way i ate so i found cherry fruit

1163
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,520
extract

1164
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,680
you know these pills that are dehydrated

1165
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
cherry fruit and i would use that for my

1166
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,000
gout so ever since

1167
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,920
then i've been a big fan of natural

1168
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
supplements back i used to have some

1169
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,079
joint issues and i took glucosamine and

1170
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,200
that help for that so

1171
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,280
i've been a big fan of it i mean if you

1172
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
need to take prescription drugs for

1173
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,200
for things definitely do that and i've

1174
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,480
fought that for years with blood

1175
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,520
pressure

1176
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,280
but there's ways around it but make sure

1177
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
that you are taking care of your health

1178
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,680
before you

1179
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,160
you know go that route you know i

1180
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,680
finally got on blood pressure medication

1181
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,160
to

1182
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,720
take care of that and for me if i do

1183
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
start getting more serious about

1184
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,440
my cardio i could probably reverse that

1185
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
but uh so yeah there's things you can do

1186
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,359
i mean just doing things like

1187
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
taking vitamin d3 that's good for your

1188
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,359
immune system and vitamin c

1189
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,359
those are things two things to always do

1190
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,119
and i rarely get sick whenever i start

1191
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,240
getting sick i take a little more

1192
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,359
vitamin c

1193
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,000
and that helps so i really do that to

1194
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
help with my immune

1195
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,040
system and when you're getting your

1196
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,599
blood test done get like your vitamin d3

1197
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,960
levels i mean because

1198
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,280
vitamin d is like real you know low

1199
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
vitamin d levels have been uh

1200
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
you know kind of associated with cancer

1201
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
and other diseases

1202
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,160
and you know just getting outside and

1203
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,000
getting not telling you to go out and

1204
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,240
tan but just getting outside

1205
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,720
and getting natural vitamin d getting

1206
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
your your body synced with the circular

1207
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,520
circadian rhythms

1208
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,079
is going to help you that's when you

1209
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,680
stay in a house too long and

1210
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,760
in that unnatural light you kind of

1211
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,960
throw things off you

1212
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,040
end up staying up late and all that so

1213
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,720
getting out into nature is going to help

1214
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,959
there

1215
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,880
so my weight loss and diet history we

1216
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,200
kind of covered some of that

1217
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,839
so i did reduce calorie diet keto and

1218
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,720
low carb

1219
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,079
in 2014 my mom died from

1220
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,640
from lung cancer which metastasized to

1221
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
her brain both my parents i lost

1222
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
to cancer from you know is basically

1223
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,079
lung cancer that

1224
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,920
that took them and so 2014 april 2014

1225
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,200
i really got serious i thought you know

1226
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
i need to be around for my daughter and

1227
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,520
my family

1228
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,880
i really need to take my health more

1229
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
seriously so i lost weight i was like

1230
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
255.

1231
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,680
started about 255 that year and ended up

1232
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,160
getting down to like 195

1233
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
by the end of the year and so

1234
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
fortunately you know i've kind of my

1235
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,599
weights kind of yo-yoed since then but

1236
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,240
it's never got back up to that 250 range

1237
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,920
i try to set a range for myself and not

1238
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,280
go above that because

1239
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
i call it my fat weight so now my fat

1240
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,359
weight is like

1241
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,839
203 so if i start getting at 203 then i

1242
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,680
know i got to cut my carbs back and do

1243
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,640
things to

1244
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
to to lose weight just to try to stay

1245
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,839
stay healthy

1246
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,320
you know in my very competitive power

1247
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,520
lifting days

1248
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,119
you know the the heavier weight didn't

1249
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,880
bother me but as you get older

1250
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
you know it starts to affect your joints

1251
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,079
and your ankles and

1252
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
it's just not really worth it so i

1253
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,720
decided i wanted the longevity

1254
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,320
so that's what a you know so let's start

1255
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,079
focusing on that so

1256
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,599
the things i've had the most success

1257
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,359
with diet wise you know i was doing

1258
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,800
a ketogenic diet in 2014 and from

1259
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,000
about may to

1260
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
about to may to november it took me to

1261
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
lose like 55 pounds

1262
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,359
and and the thing about ketogenic diets

1263
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
is you're able to lose weight without a

1264
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
lot of activity so some people

1265
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,079
you know you it's kind of hard to get

1266
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,920
activity in because if you're too heavy

1267
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,079
and so something like the ketogenic diet

1268
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,640
can get your weight down

1269
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,079
to where you can start getting some

1270
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,160
activity you know any kind of activity

1271
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,119
is helpful

1272
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,160
i mean walking simply walking is is good

1273
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,920
one of the things being a diabetic i

1274
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
really notice is the lack of activity

1275
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,560
and how

1276
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,760
it affects me when i was working

1277
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
in an office last year moving around i

1278
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,480
saw an improvement on my blood glucose

1279
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,520
levels

1280
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,200
and that's why i had to start walking

1281
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,319
some of the things i dealt with the

1282
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,359
pandemic

1283
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,240
and so also combined keto low carb and

1284
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,760
intermittent fasting is like the sweet

1285
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,000
spot for me this is what really works

1286
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,240
when i was doing really well in 2014 i

1287
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,079
didn't i would like

1288
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,079
not eat breakfast and then i would eat

1289
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,800
lunch and dinner

1290
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
and so my pandemic experience like i

1291
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,280
mentioned uh

1292
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,400
things were really stressful at work and

1293
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
i just really need in the gym closed you

1294
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,920
know the pandemic

1295
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
lockdown happened the gym closed i

1296
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,680
couldn't get into the gym that was my

1297
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,119
way to work out

1298
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,760
my way to relieve stress so i had this

1299
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
stress that i wasn't able to relieve by

1300
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
going to the gym i mean

1301
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
i've had stressful instances back in the

1302
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,880
past you know where i

1303
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,599
wasn't working out in the stress built

1304
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,119
up i started working out and helped the

1305
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,480
stress so i wasn't getting that stress

1306
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,040
relief

1307
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,880
so what i did during this time i lost 20

1308
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
pounds because i was in ones upward

1309
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
phases before the pandemic

1310
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,000
my weight had crept back up to like two

1311
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,359
220

1312
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,800
and so uh what we started doing is we

1313
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
we did you know kind of a type of

1314
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,319
intermittent fast

1315
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,920
so what we did is intermittent fasting

1316
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,079
is you know your everyone is fasting so

1317
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,599
you're

1318
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,880
there's times you're eating at times

1319
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,640
you're not so the times you're not is

1320
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
when you burn fat

1321
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,280
and so what we did and you know because

1322
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,400
for me it's hard to

1323
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,160
as if i'm in stressful situations it's

1324
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,680
hard to limit certain foods

1325
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,520
so what i did is just eliminated

1326
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
breakfast

1327
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,680
uh ate lunch and had an early dinner so

1328
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,880
i was done with my eating

1329
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,200
before five o'clock and then we were

1330
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,079
walking every day

1331
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,599
walked for 30 minutes i think it was

1332
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,520
like maybe a mile and a half

1333
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
and as the summer got hotter here in

1334
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,599
texas it gets pretty hot we walked at

1335
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,000
night

1336
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
so i really found a connection with

1337
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,599
nature if you

1338
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,040
see some see my instagram or follow uh

1339
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,480
me on twitter you saw some of the

1340
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,240
pictures the frogs and the rabbits and

1341
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,599
the owls and different

1342
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,720
things i've seen it was kind of like a

1343
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,800
meditation for me is my way to

1344
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,480
to relieve the stress of the day from

1345
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
from work and you know

1346
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,400
the social isolation i'm a very social

1347
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,480
person i love going to meetups

1348
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,400
you know when things are normal i'm

1349
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,560
hosting two meetups a month

1350
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
uh the pawn school project meetups i'm

1351
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
going to dallas hackers association

1352
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,960
north texas cyber security group

1353
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,440
sometimes our local oas meetings

1354
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,960
uh our dc214 group and things like that

1355
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,920
so i didn't have those

1356
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,240
stress relievers so the walking really

1357
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,839
helped me and just the nature of the

1358
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,960
calmness at night

1359
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,280
and and that really helped so the

1360
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,800
walking just from the exercise

1361
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,200
perspective helped me lose the weight

1362
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,040
and walking is just really low intensity

1363
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,720
exercise something that

1364
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,440
that is easy for most people to do you

1365
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,880
may have to start out walking

1366
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,440
shorter distances uh walk in areas that

1367
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
there's not very many

1368
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,079
hills and inclines until you build up

1369
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,920
your your strength and

1370
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,400
endurance and so that was what i was

1371
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,240
doing and i lost 20 pounds i lost 20

1372
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,280
pounds from

1373
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,160
about march until it took me probably

1374
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,520
about 90

1375
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,119
90 days it was like three or four months

1376
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,960
not being able to maintain most of that

1377
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,400
and i eventually and during that

1378
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,520
intermittent fasting i was eating

1379
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,720
whatever i wanted to i really wasn't

1380
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
eating low carb

1381
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,319
my wife is avid cyclist and endurance

1382
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,160
athlete she does triathlons

1383
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,119
so on fridays she would carb load for

1384
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,880
her ride on saturday

1385
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,800
and she would fix these big pasta

1386
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,000
dinners or lunches

1387
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,160
and we'd eat all this pasta and i was

1388
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,280
still losing weight but i just

1389
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,640
finally got the point i had to go back

1390
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
to to lower carb because

1391
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,440
although my weight was doing well

1392
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,240
i wasn't my blood glucose levels weren't

1393
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,079
maintaining very well

1394
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,599
so intermittent fasting everyone's doing

1395
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,440
this you may not realize it we're not

1396
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,640
eating your fasting

1397
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,880
and we need these phases what kind of

1398
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
hurt us back in the 80s

1399
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
is the low carb diet fads come along and

1400
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,560
eating more they said eat

1401
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,720
snacks in between and what happened is

1402
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,920
you're eating all the time

1403
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,200
and when you eat you're you're

1404
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,040
increasing your insulin levels

1405
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,880
insulin is if insulin is a fat storing

1406
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
hormone so

1407
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,319
if your insulin that's why people that

1408
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,839
are type 2 1 diabetic or either type 2

1409
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,000
diabetes

1410
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
have type 2 diabetes using insulin can't

1411
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,079
lose weight sometimes until they're able

1412
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,160
to get weaned off of insulin

1413
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,920
so as you're eating all the time you're

1414
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,599
storing fat so

1415
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,839
a big thing to help a lot of people is

1416
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,520
maybe just eat three meals a day don't

1417
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,960
snack in between

1418
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,680
and that's going to help you doing

1419
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,040
things like cutting out a meal

1420
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,680
eat two meals a day uh there's different

1421
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,240
kind of

1422
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
kind of testing you know different

1423
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,359
fasting windows and we'll look at some

1424
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,359
of those here real quick

1425
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,960
so intermittent fasting so you see here

1426
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,800
so this is your this is this

1427
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
on the left hand side is the fasting

1428
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,319
time on the right hand side is the

1429
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,599
eating time

1430
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,560
and this 16 8 split is usually what most

1431
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,520
people do

1432
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,960
by nature but when you really figure out

1433
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,839
you're it's really more like a 15

1434
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,200
15 nine or a 13

1435
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
13 10 i'll get the rights but yeah

1436
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,319
my mask kind of wonky there but you're

1437
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,400
usually it's usually even more hours now

1438
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,960
usually

1439
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,599
like 9 or 10 hours so just doing a

1440
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,400
simple reduction like that will help

1441
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,160
doing a four hour eating window so

1442
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,520
you're only eating for four hours

1443
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,720
so you can start eating at noon and then

1444
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,480
eat until four o'clock and don't eat

1445
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,319
after that and the thing is

1446
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,520
that's interesting with this sometimes

1447
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,359
you don't you don't have to necessarily

1448
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:21,920
reduce

1449
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
calories to do the same to to get the

1450
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,160
same effects i saw a really good

1451
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,240
uh talk on uh

1452
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,040
actually a documentary on amazon prime

1453
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,079
and that went over

1454
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,640
uh fasting and uh dr jason wong was one

1455
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,560
of the specialists on there he's a

1456
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,720
nephrologist which is a kidney doctor

1457
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,160
and uh

1458
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,920
he used this because he finally got

1459
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,400
tired of seeing his patients die

1460
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,680
they were you know they had diabetes

1461
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,119
they were insulin and they just got out

1462
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,040
of control so he started having them do

1463
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,960
intermittent fasting and fasting and it

1464
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,079
helped a lot of people

1465
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,599
and one thing some people see just

1466
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,440
eating for their circadian rhythms just

1467
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,240
eating

1468
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,160
you know during the day instead of

1469
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
eating at night you know

1470
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,280
not eat after five o'clock just making

1471
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,119
that change difference help people

1472
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
getting in sync with the their circadian

1473
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,800
rhythms you know because the nighttime

1474
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,079
eating is really where people put on a

1475
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,440
lot of weight people may not eat much or

1476
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
snack during the day

1477
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,800
but maybe they do at night so those are

1478
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
some simple things there so cutting

1479
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,040
calorie

1480
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,480
calories and calories out there's a lot

1481
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
of the the normal way people

1482
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,480
talk about losing weight that does work

1483
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
but it doesn't take and affect

1484
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,440
hormones like insulin it does to affect

1485
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
because you're eating

1486
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,920
maybe you're eating less you're not

1487
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,839
producing as much insulin but there's

1488
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,599
hormonal effects from the way you eat

1489
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,200
like your insulin levels

1490
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,800
uh reducing calories is you know one of

1491
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,640
the basic concepts of dieting

1492
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,480
but one of the things i like with the

1493
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,240
intermittent fasting is you can

1494
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,280
keep eating the way you do just you know

1495
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,680
cutting down the eating window so

1496
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,359
exercise start easy pick something you

1497
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,480
can stick with

1498
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,240
simply walking helps it helped me a

1499
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
whole lot and where this kind of even

1500
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,760
surprised me to this day the experience

1501
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,880
i have with exercise

1502
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,079
is the fact that it was something that

1503
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,000
took this little effort

1504
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,839
that helped me i mean another example is

1505
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,079
like my father-in-law he's uh

1506
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,599
on the heart transplant list and his

1507
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,160
heart health improved by doing some very

1508
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,839
minor easy workouts and it improved his

1509
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,240
heart health so you just don't

1510
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,160
understand sometimes how much that helps

1511
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,800
and just

1512
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,560
basic activity get up and move around

1513
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,839
the house each day

1514
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,839
if you're working from home get out take

1515
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,680
a little short walk just move around

1516
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,520
don't just sit in the same place

1517
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,720
all that activity is cumulative

1518
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,960
so you're building up you know those

1519
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,319
steps build up that's what

1520
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,040
kind of the motivation the step counters

1521
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
is you're using step counters to track

1522
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,440
your activity

1523
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,240
you're trying to improve activity so uh

1524
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,680
intermittent fasting and just get out

1525
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,640
there and do some walking

1526
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,960
get some light activity and and that's

1527
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,319
what helped me and i'm

1528
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,040
i'm pretty sure to help you my wife lost

1529
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,559
weight from it too i mean she's lighter

1530
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,000
than she was in

1531
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
in high school and when we got married

1532
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,760
and and basically

1533
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,839
she was you know doing the same thing i

1534
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:58,960
was doing she was just intermittent

1535
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,720
fasting and walking on top of

1536
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,119
she does a lot of cycling so she a

1537
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,400
little more carbs for the

1538
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,160
the activity she had to perform but it

1539
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,960
worked for her as well

1540
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
so i don't know if we have any time for

1541
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,119
questions or not but that concludes my

1542
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,240
my rant i'm in my talk

1543
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,440
awesome keynote phil there are two

1544
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,920
questions uh i think we have two minutes

1545
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,800
so the first one is uh they would love

1546
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,480
to know how well your students do in the

1547
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
job market

1548
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,599
they do pretty well i think the last

1549
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,200
last time i checked at last count

1550
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,079
seven of my students had gotten pin

1551
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,800
testing jobs

1552
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,480
and so not only do i help my students

1553
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,520
i'll help other people that i'm

1554
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,800
connected with on linkedin

1555
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,040
there's a guy in our local community

1556
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,480
that i knew from the meetups this is why

1557
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,680
i tell people to network

1558
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,599
i knew he was a recent college grad i

1559
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,079
had to com had a computer science

1560
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,960
degree and wanted to be a pen tester i

1561
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,920
knew someone looking for

1562
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,000
for entry-level pentesters i recommended

1563
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,839
him he got his first job so

1564
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,520
uh yeah so at least seven of my students

1565
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,960
got jobs as pen testers

1566
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,319
and there were several others that got

1567
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,160
jobs in other areas

1568
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,520
of cyber security so yeah it's uh

1569
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,880
so that's one thing i really try to do

1570
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,000
is i really try to help the students

1571
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,440
past educating

1572
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,880
the students i try to help them find

1573
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,559
jobs

1574
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,720
excellent and then the second question

1575
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,079
was is

1576
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,240
protein slash whey powder still vital

1577
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,680
for weight lifters or has it been

1578
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,359
changed up

1579
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,240
it's kind of one of the things that as

1580
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,640
things have evolved with sports fitness

1581
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,000
a lot of times you're trying to keep

1582
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,480
whey protein around post-workout

1583
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,599
because there's times insulin levels

1584
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,520
being raised is good it can cause it can

1585
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,400
if it stays

1586
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,559
elevated long or raised at times you

1587
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,400
don't need it it can store fat

1588
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,400
so whey protein kind of helps

1589
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
raise those insulin levels and it's

1590
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,680
really anabolic it helps you gain muscle

1591
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,119
so whey protein

1592
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,640
after you work out and then like a

1593
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,720
casein protein or some kind of

1594
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,880
plant-based protein during the other

1595
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,920
times of the day

1596
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
and after you work out you've got like a

1597
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,599
window there where your body

1598
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,359
is synthesizing protein more so if

1599
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,040
you're trying to gain muscle

1600
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,920
then within you know a few hours after i

1601
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,520
forget what how long the protein

1602
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,440
synthesis window lasts but

1603
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,720
hour i'd say at least you know four

1604
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,559
hours after that you're you're

1605
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,400
able to simulate protein and use it

1606
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,839
better than other times because a lot of

1607
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,680
times you just overeat a protein

1608
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,040
you're like overeating food it's not

1609
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,559
necessarily going to build muscle

1610
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,440
perfect

1611
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,800
thanks so much phil
