1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
we've got it's not magic insider threat

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,360
detection

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
and the perfect cup of coffee with our

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,399
presenter

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
will baggett will are you there

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,120
i am here can you hear me awesome possum

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,639
yes indeed you can

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,240
alright turning it over to you all right

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
thank you everybody for tuning into this

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
one uh

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
covering a little bit of an esoteric

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,519
track on

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
the digital forensics incident response

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,039
digital forensics

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,238
insider threat got this label as it's

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,360
not

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
magic and let's see if doug henning does

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
doug hitting things there he goes

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
so i'm will baggett uh certified

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
collection exploit engineer

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,879
certified fraud examiner and i've

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
recently got a promotion who to

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,039
a insider threat systems architect with

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
one of the big consulting firms so

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,559
what that does we'll find out um

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
my career path i was with a financial

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,160
service company in atlanta

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
uh from that i was recruited into cia

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,920
after many years there moved over to

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
into nato

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
and around the time coveted i went to

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
the private sector and now i'm with the

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
consulting firm

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
so i took a lot of the things i learned

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
as a digital analyst and moving into a

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
consultant

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
answering more of the questions that

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
what if how would we address this rather

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
than just plugging through tickets on

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
the commercial side

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
uh now working as more of a specialist

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
to help corporations address the ways

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,720
that if

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
we are coming through as

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
i don't want to say hackers that's not a

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,399
good word anymore but coming through

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
to move data without permission how

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
would we address

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
mitigate and stop the risk before it

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,759
begins

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
so that's where i stand right now i'm

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
moving up the food chain to an architect

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,159
into leadership

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,680
and the difference between incident

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
response

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
and insider threat

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
i went with a picture of a dam you don't

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
want to have a leak with a damn that's a

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
bad thing

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
usually so you've got your data breaches

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,280
data comes out it's

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,640
usually triggered by something external

63
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,000
solarwinds124 exclamation point has been

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
a lot of our work lately

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,599
but you don't want that data coming out

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
from the outside threat you know

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
something's gone wrong let's mitigate

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,520
the risk

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
of the outside act or the insider threat

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
you've got someone at the workstation

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
who does something generally consciously

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
that would enable data loss

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,879
solar winds versus the edward snowden

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
type leak

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,680
so we'll address how to work with this

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
one of the common questions on both

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
security plus ceh sysup

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
difference between black box and white

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,319
box

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,280
penetration test

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,640
the black box you know there's very

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
little data provided

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,159
just like as if we were going on the

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,519
capture the flag running through other

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,120
channels

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
what can we find we'll seem like the

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,239
outside attacker and if we have pros

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,360
versus joe's

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,480
we would have a team working to see if

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
they could detect the penetration team

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
to see if it's a true threat

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
or see if it's just a simulation or

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
purple team white box all the data is

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,200
provided this

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
credentials are provided and as you know

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
from your test questions this is the

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
more damaging attack because the insider

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,159
knows

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,760
where the secrets are kept and how to

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,399
get them out

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,239
so this is looking at someone with

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:38,959
access

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
and malicious intent one of our security

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,480
questions

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
last week for the corporation the most

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,879
common cause of a security incident is

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,080
human behavior

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
it may not be the intern again it

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
shouldn't be the intern being blamed for

110
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
the solarwinds breach i don't need to

111
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,079
editorialize here

112
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
somebody does something that causes an

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,239
incident whether it's the person who

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
answers a cell phone call and a skiff

115
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,200
whether they change the settings on

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
whatever workstation to change

117
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
share their data or they install

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,879
software on their

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,000
laptop that inadvertently leaks data out

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we had a table on top exercise with a

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
client for insider threat

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,079
uh california and gdpr that's

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
they have some different views on

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
privacy

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,800
the colleague was allowed to use the

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
workstation at home

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
the child was on the workstation they

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
went to go movies.com i'm sure we all

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,479
know the websites to watch something

130
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
for free and it began downloading flash

131
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
updates not really flash updates

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
loading malware on the corporate machine

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,440
that's human behavior violating that

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,280
nda saying no one else can use your

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
machine they've now downloaded and

136
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
installed malicious software which could

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
spread out to the rest of the industry

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,199
or

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
rest of the enterprise

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
now taking all that the incident

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
response

142
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,639
and what makes insider threat different

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
uh when i was a whatever type of

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
ops officer at the cia going through the

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
recruitment cycle

146
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,560
we would have the uh the acronym mice

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
what would make someone commit espionage

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
against their home country against their

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
own self-interest

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,759
and on the commercial side we've

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
modified that a little bit but it comes

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
down to this

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,199
one simple catchphrase mice money

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
ideology conscience or compromise

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
ego or excitement i don't like the way

156
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,000
this government is handling this crisis

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
i'm going to let

158
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
another government know what's going on

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
i'm going to tell washington post on

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
page two about this classified program

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,639
but it usually falls into one of these

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
four buckets

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
on the commercial side money ideology

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,479
career

165
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,360
and external activities so career i

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
could mean

167
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
and we've seen this with a large client

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
that we had last year

169
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
i don't need to get ahead of myself too

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
far

171
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
for whatever reason there was a chat

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,319
about

the salary cap how did they get this

185
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,960
ostentatious display of wealth

186

when the salary doesn't support it

187
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,039

commitment consisting because career i

193

liking and social proof basically give

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
to get to give

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,520
hey oh the simple one tell me about the

areas of your work

198
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
that we're not allowed to talk about

199
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
that way when we meet for coffee next

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,120
week i'll know

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
not to target that people begin talking

202
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
about the classified areas they're not

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
supposed to discuss with outsiders

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
it's amazingly simple to how often that

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,199
works

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
not to get into war stories i did that

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
last couple of years ago i was

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
training uh there was somebody from the

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
former soviet bloc he comes up to me in

210
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,520
the classroom

211
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
issues you're having with your country

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
oh we're having problems with a b c and

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
d that country x is doing to us

221
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,720
and i just kind of smiled at him he rise

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
that the tables are turned

223
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,319
he's now leaking classified that he

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,680
shouldn't

225
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
and this went back to the module i was

226
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
teaching over there for social

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
engineering

228
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
it's very easy that's why so many people

229
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
have a great career in

230
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,919
social engineering as a pen test but

231
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,360
this does work

232
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,039
to get people to leak data out

233
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
one of the biggest issues and don't have

234
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
really time to address this

235
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
facebook allows you to be anybody they

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680

like an ibm something like a kodak or

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,799
whoever

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
approach the employees of your company

247

and we can help get you the most money

260

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,480
ideology you're killing the ego in the

262
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
money career

263
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
people don't realize it's an outside

264
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
actor soliciting information

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
working with the pharmaceutical company

266
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,399
there's a large number of people trying

267
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,760
to elicit

268
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
through hook or by crook the formula for

269
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
a cova vaccine

270
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
and i'm editing a lot out of nda

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
this is a very effective method to

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
approach people that they wouldn't

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
expect

274
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
a lot of twitterverse groans about

275
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
the horrible inmails i'm

276
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
again choosing the words extremely

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
carefully from recruiters

278
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
hey we'd like you to move to middle of

279
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
nowhere for a six month

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,200
1099 contract with no benefits far below

281
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
what you're paying now

282
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,360
are you interested no yet they persist

283
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
the elements of insider threat we've got

284
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
the human factor

285
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
the technical collection analysis is one

286
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
way we can detect it we'll touch on that

287
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,120
in a minute

288
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
and still the gaps in coverage

289
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
technology emerges

290
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
technology changes

291
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
terms and service agreements change in a

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
moment's notice probably a lot of us saw

293
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
disney change their terms and conditions

294
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,079
6.99 a month

295
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,480
it's now 7.99 a month if you want to see

296
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
black widow and

297
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,480
winter soldier in the falcon updates

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,279
right

299
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
it's a dollar or whatever but you still

300
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
change the terms and conditions

301
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,839
evernote might only collect in sync the

302
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
one folder but with the latest update

303
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,079
it could sync the entire desktop now all

304
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,279
the classified or

305
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,440
not classified sensitive data that's on

306
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
your desktop is now synced up to the

307
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
outside box

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,440
we have to an insider threat identify

309
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
how these threats are merging to the

310
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
corporation

311
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,279
and try to stay ahead

312
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
we have not seen the stride methodology

313
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
for counter forensics

314
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
mention that just to get a yet another

315
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
cool five-letter acronym six-letter

316
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,680
acronym

317
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
it's the usgm coming out

318
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
but if you have something spoofing

319
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,079
changing the file names

320
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,120
so sensitivefile.pdf becomes

321
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,079
bobsoccerphotos.jpg and they try to get

322
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,640
it through

323
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
the filter digital loss production

324
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,720
dlp software may or may not catch that

325
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
so files being renamed in mass

326
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
people elevating privilege just like

327
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
with this recent pseudo flaw that was

328
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,560
discovered where you can elevate a

329
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,240
regular linux account into a pseudo

330
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
account

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
these things do happen on the corporate

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
network but not as often

333
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,360
as the general inadvertent and i say

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
general most people

335
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
especially in the world of covet don't

336
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
want to do something to harm their

337
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
employer

338
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,279
a robust insider threat team again

339
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,560
coming from the

340
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
i hate to say it rogue cowboy go out

341
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
give me a laptop something to do i'll

342
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,760
fly out let you know what i've done

343
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
and come back operating independently

344
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
again choosing my words carefully this

345
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
is a new world for me having to work

346
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
with teams of human resources security

347
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,920
and legal but for the insider threat

348
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,800
team

349
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
this is who we need because all three

350
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
can provide us the information

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
to help build that threat model we don't

352
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
go to virus total for insider threat

353
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,839
these are our sources for the recent

354
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,320
updates

355
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
generally your mileage may vary

356
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
the buckets of users that we would want

357
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
to monitor that's a horrible infosec

358
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,639
sherpa

359
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,399
would not be happy with my

360
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
classification of buckets of users

361
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
but whether it's a new hire a new

362
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
employee contractor gives two weeks

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
notice i had a contractor give me five

364
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
minute notice back in the day that was a

365
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
good time

366
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
if someone has a known performance issue

367
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
their performance drops from being a

368
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,079
rock star to absolutely

369
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
bare minimum checking their pulse to see

370
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,519
if they're still with us

371
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
it could be somebody who's a network

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
admin

sock analyst defeat analyst who's going

374
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,560
to have a higher level of scrutiny and

375
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
given the level of access these three

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
jobs have

377
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,599
hate to say it i do agree with it

378
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
lifestyle concerns again are they going

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
to tahiti

380
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200

the valley a lot at the airport

382
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,920

384
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,000
the other if there's impending layoffs

387
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
you know these adverse

388
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
actions are going to happen and morale

389
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
is questionable

390
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
human resources talent management may

391
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,000
want to put those names

392
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
on a list to be added for enhanced

393
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,959
monitoring to see if additional actions

394
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,279
are

395
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
taken by these employees deleting mass

396
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,120
numbers of files

397
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,480
generally everything is recoverable

398
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
emailing large numbers of files out

399
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
actively searching for a job on the

trying to gain access to files they

402
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
shouldn't the general malicious

403
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
behaviors can be monitored and

404
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
generally watched and caught beforehand

405
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,600
as a fraud examiner i picked that up uh

406
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
while studying for other exams it was

407
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,519
just in this world why not pick all the

408
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
certs up you can if you can

409
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,959
the fraud triangle not my concept it's

410
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,320
from the american

411
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
association of fraud examiners

412
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,240
if you have the opportunity to steal the

413
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,519
rationalization well

414
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,560
i didn't get my promotion i know mary

415
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
got it she didn't deserve it and i'm

416
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
having financial issues at home going

417
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
through a divorce

418
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
taxes have gone up my radiator blew on

419
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
my car

420
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,760
people can self-justify why it's okay to

421
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
steal money from the corporation

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
and now with big data you can see the

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,160
smaller leaks in a bigger picture a

424
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
granular example

425
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,160
way back there was a branch manager we

426
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
came into work

427
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
this is before i came to the intel

428
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
community came in

429
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,639
georgia bureau of miss investigation was

430
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,120
there fbi was there bank security was

431
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
there

432
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
and they were looking for the branch

433
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
manager and he wasn't there they can't

434
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,199
find him

435
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
every time he would get a bundle of

436
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,880
money from the fed reserve

437
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,279
he was always one hundred dollar bill

438
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
short

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,959
he'd do the shortage list tell the fed

440
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,880
you're short a hundred dollars

441
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
you can do that exactly once in your

442
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
career still a hundred dollars

443
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
and nobody's gonna think twice but if it

444
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,759
happens

445
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
week after week after week employer

446
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
after employer after employer and you're

447
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,120
the only person now the big data says

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
it's not the fed reserve shorting the

449
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
hundred dollar stacks

450
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,320
it's you and that's how we're using

451
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
big data to triangulate to see where the

452
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,519
fraud is coming in

453
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,880
getting more getting granular repeated

454
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
violations of dlp digital

455
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,880
loss prevention programs mcafee or

456
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
office 365

457
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
they're trying to access plans and

458
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
intense targeted files for

459
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,920
next year's sales bonuses for

460
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
the contract with bob's widget company

461
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
bob does everything

462
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
calling the help desk to say i i really

463
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
need access to this sharepoint folder

464
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
i don't have it but it would help me in

465
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
my job

466
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,839
noting they don't have access to these

467
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,360
files but they persist

468
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
to look for the one help desk person to

469
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,880
say yes

470
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
that would be added to the watch list

471
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
access violations

472
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
same thing if they repeatedly try to go

473
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
to dropbox slap

474
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,000
and there are dozens if not hundreds if

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,120
not thousands of chat

476
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,839
programs where they can exfil data out

477
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,560
underneath the corporate network

478
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
if they're going for more of the intel

479
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
side going for the need to know versus

480
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
need to know the need to know ben says

481
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
here's your daily job duties versus

482
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
i don't know what these other people are

483
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
doing because that sounds a lot cooler

484
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,919
or is someone paying you to gain access

485
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,959
to that

486
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,839
all of these data points can be

487
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
assembled and given a user a score for

488
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,480
their risk behavior

489
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,000
what i wanted here was a good slide of a

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
kid squeezing play-doh you the

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,280
plato being the data and when you

492
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
squeeze it to x fill the data

493
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,280
it can only go out in so many ways it's

494
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
either going out through usb

495
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,760
sd card bluetooth bluetooth connections

496
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
are still generally wide open

497
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,440
email is a little bit tougher printing i

498
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
mean who prints anymore

499
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
the chat and shadow it services their

500
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
clients who would enable blue jeans

501
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,520
or zoom or slack

502
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
when the corporation doesn't allow to

503
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,840
accomplish tasks more efficiently

504
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
what we found with slack at the time

505
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
being a free service someone could

506
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,679
install it

507
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,480
go to the web browser create channels

508
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,760
connected to google drive

509
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,799
x fill the data delete the channel and

510
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,320
at that time

511
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
the channel was not recoverable nor the

512
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
data that went through there

513
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
if you had a paid version of slack that

514
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
was recoverable but at the time that was

515
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,360
free so

516
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,039
perfect if you're doing cobcom data

517
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
exfil for a three-letter agency

518
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
horrible if you have a corporation

519
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
trying to keep solvent

520
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
during a pandemic sync services

521
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
two that are of great concern are both

522
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
google of course and apple big surprise

523
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
you're not aware on the network that the

524
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
data on my laptop

525
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
is being synced to the cloud and then

526
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
resynced out whether it's amazon

527
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
apple or google to the multiple drives

528
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
the other person may have so they might

529
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
have just innocently saved

530
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
a text document from a to b in their

531
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,799
imessage

532
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,480
and now that syncs out you've lost the

533
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,360
data for the sensitive document

534
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,880
how are you going to address that

535
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
because both apple and google

536
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
do have the ability with apple data

537
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
recovery

538
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,919
i don't have the slide deck for that

539
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,240
here and google takeout you can recover

540
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,840
everything every cringy email text

541
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
web history ever done while you're

542
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
logged into google is recoverable

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,039
it's non-reputable if

544
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,160
said a word so if law enforcement legal

545
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
needed to get up

546
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,679
an accurate copy that would still be

547
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,799
something the end user can't tamper with

548
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
so if a malicious user emails a document

549
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,120
to themselves and we log on and say we

550
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
want to watch you delete that file from

551
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
your gmail

552
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
dirty secret is it's still there on

553
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
google drive

554
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
once leave the corporation they can

555
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
still recover the document even though

556
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
we had them deleted in front of us

557
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
human resources and security the data is

558
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,240
still there

559
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
so sync services are an emerging threat

560
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,840
to the corporation

561
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,919
and we have to learn how to mitigate

562
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
this risk

563
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
the accidental data x fill if you've

564
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
seen my other slide for broken arrow for

565
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,039
assisting digital assistant a digital

566
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,480
abuse victims

567
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
this is the same concept but on the

568
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
corporate side facebook messenger stores

569
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,880
the

570
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,919
granular chats between a and b b to a

571
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,159
with not just they texted each other

572
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,840
here's the full body of the text that

573
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
hears all the documents

574
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,280
and all the phone calls made on the

575
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
phone there was a

576
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,200
commander of some and they wanted their

577
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,880
officers to report in when they arrived

578
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
in hostile lands whatever

579
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
through facebook messenger which then

580
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
harvested all the

581
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
gray sensitive but unclassified data

582
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,159
from their phones is now stored by

583
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
facebook

584
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
this is horrible for a corporation this

585
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,960
is great if you need to prove

586
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
you know a sent me these abusive text

587
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
messages and here's the authoritative

588
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,039
file saying this happened

589
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
but for this bowl of rice i hate that

590
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,640
term sorry

591
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
for this talk

592
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
having facebook messenger monitor

593
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,200
everything that occurs on a work phone

594
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,799
that's a major source of data loss

595
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,159
that's going to have to be addressed by

596
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,360
us collectively in the future

597
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
this screen sets up the next one log on

598
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
warning but i'll just click on this it's

599
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
the spouse install okay

600
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,720
okay okay okay we just click through it

601
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
but this legal con legal consent page

602
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
says

603
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,480
here's the back half the user doesn't

604
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,919
see

605
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,320
we can log on uh we can monitor your

606
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
network traffic log on

607
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
dates and times badge access from

608
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,320
security everything done in o365s for

609
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,280
team chat

610
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
files open change modified if you have

611
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
the druva endpoint agent

612
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
we can get your laptop name connect to

613
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,960
that

614
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
laptop look in your folders remotely

615
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
surreptitiously to see

616
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,159
what you have staged to x fill

617
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,080
and with mcafee dlp you can see the usb

618
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
what was copied to and from the usb the

619
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,919
serial number which is pretty cool you

620
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,120
can see

621
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
how many times that usb was plugged in

622
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
throughout the corporation

623
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
conversely if you're doing a pin test

624
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,360
drop a usb on the sensitive site

625
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
note the serial number the usb then you

626
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,559
can see how many other users plugged in

627
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,720
that usb and didn't report it

628
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
a couple of different uses for this but

629
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
again mcafee you can see all the

630
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
data documents printed and what was

631
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,799
saved to the clipboard

632
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,840
the downside print i should have had the

633
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
mr incredible meme here

634
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
print means print so it's not just print

635
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,799
to the hp printer it's print to pdf and

636
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,720
store in sharepoint so until you tune

637
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
out your

638
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
alerts every time someone prints a pdf

639
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,679
in stores in sharepoint which is

640
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,840
good behavior you're going to get alert

641
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,400
they did something risky

642
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,679
another issue in 2021 as i was joking

643
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,080
with

644
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
one of the mods before this it still

645
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,600
feels like march 2020

646
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,760
when you print within hp specifically it

647
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
unless you uncheck the box i don't trust

648
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,039
it

649
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,840
the data of what you printed the

650
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
verbiage

651
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
all goes to hp for marketing analysis

652
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
i'm not really cool with that i just

653
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
want a printer to print i don't want to

654
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
give all my tax data to hp

655
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
just because i bought a 40 printer from

656
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,559
walmart

657
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,480
that that's not part of the deal this

658
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
deal is getting worse

659
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
as it goes on so take all this data

660
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
realize this is a shorter talk we have

661
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
coffee discussed

662
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
we start to look for the anomaly so we

663
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,559
look for the behavior issues

664
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,080
so we've got this is magnet axiom

665
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,360
we've got 17 000

666
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,720
artifacts within the cloud but only

667
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,039
three

668
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
two data tables a powerpoint and two

669
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
word docs those the anomalies

670
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,640
what was sent out from a to b who sent

671
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
this out and why did it go out over

672
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
slack when slack isn't authorized

673
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,400
knowing who you're looking at why you're

674
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
looking at and zeroing in on the threat

675
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,080
versus trying to figure out what the

676
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
heck solarwinds did your network

677
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
it's a little bit different one of the

678
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,559
countermeasures honey files

679
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,080
just like a honeypot for the outside

680
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,480
attacker but it's a

681
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
interesting file super interesting

682
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
company file on the

683
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,279
website uh proposed raises uh

684
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
promotion list uh grievance list

685
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
we've used that uh pin testing at nato

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,279
we had a grievance list

687
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,960
act surprisingly the kotar for the

688
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
contract plugged in that file to see

689
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,720
because he was concerned about his job

690
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,080
knowing we're training on social

691
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,320
engineering whatever

692
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
you know this is one option see who

693
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,919
actually accesses the sensitive files

694
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
and possibly put them on a watch list

695
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,559
i'll tell my kids this i have uh

696
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
they're now in their junior year of

697
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,240
college but this is one of the phrases

698
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,200
can versus should and i'm tossing this

699
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,799
caveat into the

700
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
discussion just because you can

701
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
provide data just because as a

702
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
corporation you can do something

703
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,679
should you uh one manager at a previous

704
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,039
life want to know

705
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,799
every time all of his operators open

706
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
their email who he sent the email to

707
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,520
what he did after the email that was out

708
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
of scope it was just

709
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
they received it they responded to you

710
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,400
what they do afterwards

711
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,760
they have a degree of privacy and as an

712
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
individual operator whether you're the

713
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,320
analyst

714
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,480
consultant architect or leadership

715
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,640
yeah we could put behavior analytics to

716
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
determine terms of

717
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,559
they're happy with the corporation

718
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,320
they're angry and put the

719
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,440
keywords to indicate

720
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,559
employee behavior and how they feel do

721
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,159
you really want to go that road

722
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
to me that's a bridge too far that's

723
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
something i'm not comfortable i would

724
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
push back on it i have pushed back in

725
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
the past

726
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,840
and not to preach if we don't say this

727
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,400
is too much who will

728
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,919
the traditional risk mitigation

729
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
principles control your access the need

730
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
to know and separation of

731
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,960
roles that applies to accounting that

732
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
applies to infosec just tossing that out

733
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,000
here

734
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
for something to consider of what access

735
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,000
do they really

736
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
have do they really need this access i'm

737
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,480
starting to run against the wall here

738
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
documentation

739
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
when you interview someone document it

740
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
that's going to be a part of the insider

741
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
threat role you have to know

742
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,039
why the person is of interest as you

743
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,559
find something interesting document

744
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
whether it's in a jira ticket whether

745
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,559
it's in

746
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,960
srs whatever help desk methodology your

747
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,520
sock is using

748
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
make sure you document this if you find

749
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320
something sensitive whether it's

750
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
eyes only coca-cola original formula

751
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,919
child pornography

752
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
whatever sensitive may be in your world

753
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
have an sop for how am i going to handle

754
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
this before

755
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,000
we do this investigation never assume

756
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
that comes with a war story shortly

757
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,399
we're doing one insider threat for

758
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,840
millions of dollars has been funded by

759
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,480
the corporation

760
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
becky williams on slack johnny's

761
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,919
fictitious name

762
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,559
and rebecca jones show up in a slight

763
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,600
channel later

764
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,200
we were treating these as two separate

765
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,320
entities separate names separate user id

766
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
when we were talking with the client oh

767
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
that's them they went through a divorce

768
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
and changed your name to be more

769
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
professional that changed the world for

770
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,880
the way we were treating the

771
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,399
investigation it now had one prime

772
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,678
suspect instead of two

773
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
once it's an accident twice as a

774
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,080
coincidence three times

775
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
if they repeatedly go back to that honey

776
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,840
file looking for more and more data

777
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
those of you who know know those who

778
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
don't cable traffic is the official

779
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
documented record of the intelligence

780
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
community starting with state department

781
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
going back to 1947 wikileaks has a lot

782
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,000
of this

783
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,880
out there the chief of stations

784
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,399
management leadership those are two

785
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,279
different things

786
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
let's say if it ain't cable traffic it

787
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,520
ain't your promise this

788
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
benefit for your permanent move to this

789
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,360
country if you didn't get

790
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,159
in cable traffic no one has to honor it

791
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,240
much like acceptance offers for new jobs

792
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,159
if it's not written

793
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
if it ain't documented it ain't same

794
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,960
with dealing with hr legal and security

795
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,279
if you don't document that one file the

796
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,720
anomaly that you've seen in

797
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
whatever forensic tool you're using

798
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
whether it's incident response or

799
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
insider threat if you don't document it

800
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
when you come across a vial

801
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
good luck remembering that tomorrow

802
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
after another thousand files you've

803
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,360
sorted through document it when you see

804
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,399
it

805
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,760
this one means nothing i just like it

806
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
two is one one is none

807
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
if you're going to look through

808
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,960
something forensically

809
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,679
use a second tool kit to validate your

810
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,799
results and see what other data is there

811
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,880
if it ever goes to court the defense is

812
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,960
going to ask what additional steps do

813
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
you use to validate your findings

814
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
some corporations only want to spend the

815
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
money to have one tool kit

816
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,240
i don't feel comfortable working for

817
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
those because my reputation my name my

818
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
freedom in court is on the line

819
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,120
saying i feel good with this versus i've

820
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,480
validated it with multiple tools

821
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,760
all right the system worked

822
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
we found an insider threat they're

823
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,840
acting kind to us

824
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,679
and we're going to have a meeting right

825
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,600
not yet i had the six eyes rolled when

826
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,360
we deployed with whatever widget that's

827
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,480
very

828
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
sterile sorry before we would leave i

829
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,200
would take my widget that i was going to

830
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
deploy

831
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,159
meet with a colleague and then somebody

832
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,559
who worked alongside us but not in our

833
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,039
group

834
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,200
to show them train them here's what

835
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
we're doing here's how we're going to do

836
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:08,960
it

837
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,240
and here's how it works this validated

838
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
by understanding their understanding of

839
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,480
the thing

840
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,159
and that we had everything required

841
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,600
before deployment

842
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,279
and i said that in this environment for

843
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,039
this

844
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,600
before we would go to leadership human

845
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,559
resources security

846
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,200
this is me but i strongly encourage the

847
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,360
listenership here to do the same

848
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
take the findings for people who are

849
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
cleared to see the same bucket of

850
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
results

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
present it to them let them look through

852
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
it because if you've made a mistake it

853
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,640
could result in someone's termination

854
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
adverse career actions of someone

855
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
working with the corporation

856
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,159
i would want someone to take the same

857
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,159
duty of care for my career

858
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,000
as i will for theirs because if we make

859
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
a mistake that could be their job

860
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,919
and the chain events afterwards because

861
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,440
i made a mistake

862
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
i don't want to do that i want to do the

863
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,840
right thing the first time

864
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
we present the documented findings to

865
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
leadership

866
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,159
there's a meeting we present what we

867
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,679
found we have the

868
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,640
enumerated files 200 files from this

869
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
sharepoint were sent to

870
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,559
their personal gmail account after they

871
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,320
accepted this

872
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
job offer from outside vendor

873
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,440
after they began after they accepted the

874
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
file after they

875
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
accepted the result large numbers of

876
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
files went out this is malicious they're

877
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
leaking company property

878
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
and intellectual property to be used by

879
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,559
the competition

880
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,679
at this point this is a hard thing on

881
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,279
the commercial side

882
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
i've done my job i've provided all this

883
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,799
data

884
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,080
to leadership and it's on to them

885
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,880
some countries will that's on them just

886
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,679
to break in

887
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,880
uh 15 minutes for you okay

888
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
that's on them uh we've done our part

889
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
legally as consultants we've shown them

890
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
what's happened

891
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
some people don't some management roles

892
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,159
don't think it's a big deal yeah

893
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,919
well they work on it so they can take it

894
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,519
home all right well that's your finding

895
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,519
i've done my job as an insider threat

896
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,559
analyst close the case and move on to

897
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,559
the next one

898
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,279
other times it would be we want you to

899
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,880
meet with security leadership

900
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,440
show us what you found or stop working

901
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,640
all together

902
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
law enforcement is coming in and be

903
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,039
prepared to meet with them

904
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,840
but the world is gray

905
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,360
clear and present danger what might be a

906
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,080
red flag

907
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,240
termination event for some corporations

908
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
might be a coaching letter for others

909
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,840
and then yet another one it might be a

910
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
non-event

911
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,279
it all depends on the corporate culture

912
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,640
the sensitivity of the data

913
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,000
numerous other factors but be prepared

914
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
what you have found

915
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,159
once you submit your report you've

916
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,440
addressed the breach you've said this

917
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,799
could be a problem for the company

918
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,399
and move on one last thought before we

919
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,799
roll the coffee

920
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
the intelligence community cia had a

921
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,120
mandated maximum tour length

922
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,480
for people doing analysis of sensitive

923
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,880
materials whether it's

924
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
terrorist executions other horrific

925
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,080
things

926
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
we don't need to open that on a sunday

927
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
night

928
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
but they were allowed a year to two

929
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,880
years maximum

930
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,480
with a mandated visit to a counselor

931
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
the end of every week for the horrific

932
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,080
things they were seeing and reporting on

933
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,559
the old jeff foxworthy joke no one ever

934
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,240
stops by the lost luggage counter and

935
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,000
says hey everything's good here no one

936
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
comes through the insider threat team

937
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,679
and says hey everything's cool you guys

938
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,120
have a great day

939
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
we're always dealing with people having

940
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
their worst decisions professionally at

941
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
the worst time

942
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,320
it's okay to rotate out my current role

943
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,360
is in a

944
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,240
architect system building position

945
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
instead of a boots on the ground

946
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,679
investigatory role

947
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,279
i'm actually okay with that because you

948
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,879
don't need to see

949
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
horrific things staying down it's not

950
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,079
good for you mentally

951
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,280
the best thing you can do for other

952
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,440
people is to take care of yourself first

953
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
this is a fun role i absolutely enjoy

954
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,520
doing this type of work

955
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,839
but rotate in rotate out the people who

956
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,760
make careers of counterintelligence the

957
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,320
careers

958
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,359
insider threat the child crimes task

959
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,719
force

960
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,799
you've got to step away for the sake of

961
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,359
yourself

962
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
so the too long didn't read version

963
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,199
identify the key dates and scope

964
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
prior to investigation mind the gaps in

965
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
collection think how else could this

966
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
data go out how are they staging it why

967
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,879
are they exhaling it

968
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,520
document the events when they happen and

969
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,320
rotate out

970
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,239
on a regular basis you can always come

971
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
back in the core principles are there

972
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
technology is going to change

973
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,880
but the same con-ops of how is this

974
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,079
person getting data out of the

975
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,760
corporation how are they breaching

976
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
corporate security the core concepts

977
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,079
will be there take care of yourself

978
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,160
first

979
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
totally switching hats from that uh one

980
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
good cup of coffee in three minutes or

981
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,480
less

982
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,880
i didn't drink coffee at all until my uh

983
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,119
twins were born and then i started work

984
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,320
at cia and

985
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
roughly right after that i'm dating

986
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,760
myself a 911 hit and we had some pretty

987
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,599
long ships in response to the terrorist

988
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,560
attack

989
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,000
coffee became my lifeblood

990
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
dark roast is good light roast has more

991
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,839
caffeine

992
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,279
so the steps are fairly simple

993
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
we've got 10 minutes left here this will

994
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,839
be short

995
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
there was a gentleman who worked latin

996
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,359
and south america

997
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
one of his side hobbies he was excuse me

998
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,040
he was a coffee taster

999
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
his taste buds were insured by lloyd's

1000
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,880
of london for several million dollars

1001
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,000
we had a meeting with him in the

1002
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
facility he had just come back from

1003
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,680
columbia and he says

1004
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
i've just brought that i've just

1005
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,800
returned from coffee uh

1006
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,079
from coffee i've just returned from

1007
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,720
columbia full stop

1008
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,000
i've made some coffee from columbia

1009
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,359
would you like some well of course if

1010
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
you just flew back well those

1011
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
were two different senses that's one of

1012
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,880
the first examples of

1013
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,839
the weasel world of cia that i got into

1014
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
it was a superb cup of coffee and then

1015
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
the reveal was it was

1016
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,040
walmart sam's blend colombian copy the

1017
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
cheapest of the cheap coffee pre-ground

1018
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
is two dollars for 16 ounces back then

1019
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
he said the most important thing is to

1020
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,760
clean your equipment

1021
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
if you don't clean the equipment

1022
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,599
properly before you grind the beans

1023
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,920
have your water and take care of the

1024
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
rest of the process

1025
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,359
it doesn't matter here's kicking the

1026
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,400
podium like if i

1027
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
training military this is the key right

1028
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,359
here

1029
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,760
like really will this is it yeah this is

1030
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
it

1031
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,079
even my college son swills coffee loves

1032
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,200
coffee

1033
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,760
he still has this in his kitchen in new

1034
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,880
mexico because

1035
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,040
dawn removes oils and bacteria from the

1036
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,359
coffee equipment

1037
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
other detergents only remove bacteria

1038
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,119
that's great you don't want salmonella

1039
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,960
but you're still going to that oil build

1040
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,119
up from all the previous cups of coffee

1041
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,359
on the grinder on the coffee pot

1042
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,440
everywhere your coffee touches that oil

1043
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
is going to build up and just give that

1044
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,599
nasty you know that exact taste that

1045
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,200
just stale taste

1046
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,240
and you want to get unscented dawn for

1047
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,839
clean equipment why

1048
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,960
because if you have soap floral bouquet

1049
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,079
flavored coffee

1050
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,079
nobody wants to know that you cleaned

1051
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,240
your coffee pot

1052
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,280
with dawn's spring scent

1053
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,359
nobody wants that ralphie might i don't

1054
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,240
we're going to use a aeropress mechanism

1055
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,280
we want to use finely ground beans white

1056
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
roast has more caffeine than a dark

1057
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,079
roast

1058
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,680
the large grind means more water seeps

1059
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,640
through the filter

1060
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
more water that seeps through the filter

1061
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,839
means you're going to have weak coffee

1062
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,200
wheat coffee means you're probably going

1063
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
to sleep and if you're asleep on the job

1064
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,720
that's probably not a desirable behavior

1065
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,200
uh magnolia coffee cells god blessed

1066
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,960
ancillary they sell coffee flavored

1067
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
coffee they also sell some other blends

1068
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,480
and my cup today is local tikka k coffee

1069
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,880
from tkcoffee.com they don't ship yet

1070
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
it's just a local boutique

1071
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,520
but that's what i've got

1072
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
you want to get your coffee heated up to

1073
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,760
175 degrees fahrenheit 80 degrees

1074
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,560
celsius

1075
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,240
if you really want iced coffee zero

1076
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
degrees kelvin might be a little bit

1077
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,520
cold at that point

1078
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,400
but it will warm up you don't want

1079
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,280
boiling blowing it's too hot so

1080
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
at the desk get a thermometer make your

1081
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
best guess

1082
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,160
this is an aeropress you have the

1083
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
plunger

1084
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,680
the mechanism we have a couple of steps

1085
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,599
through this it's i don't work for

1086
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,040
aeropress i don't sell

1087
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
aeropress this is the method my son

1088
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
taught me

1089
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
i liked it better than the other methods

1090
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
because the waist

1091
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,560
compared to a k-cup is much less

1092
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
oh i wish we could have live demos for a

1093
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
live conference basically

1094
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,960
put the filter in the bottom wet it

1095
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
screw the top in make sure it's a good

1096
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,440
seal

1097
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,960
otherwise you're going to have a leak

1098
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,560
you don't want to copy leak just like

1099
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,960
you don't want a data leak

1100
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,680
you're going to put 16 grams for hot

1101
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,240
coffee

1102
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
of grounds above the filter 17.5 for

1103
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,040
cold they found that

1104
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,040
the coffee was weaker using 16 grams

1105
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,920
17.5 or higher

1106
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,520
gave a stronger cup of coffee when

1107
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,560
you're doing cold brew

1108
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
you want to shake the aeropress to get

1109
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,319
it level

1110
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,760
add it to the one line and the cylinder

1111
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,560
that's about 75 milliliters of water

1112
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,760
the press this is brilliant design the t

1113
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,440
shape is enough that you can stir the

1114
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
coffee agitate the coffee stir

1115
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,400
shake or press we're going to shake or

1116
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,200
we're going to stir it

1117
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,240
that shape that depth is just enough

1118
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
it's not going to disturb the coffee

1119
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,119
filter

1120
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
after 10 seconds of stirring for

1121
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,640
espresso or a minute for cold brew

1122
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,880
take the plunger and in a vertical

1123
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,480
method this is key because if you come

1124
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,280
at an angle

1125
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,000
and have a slick surface your coffee cup

1126
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
is going to shoot to the side and you're

1127
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,720
going to have a

1128
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
coffee leak which is worse than data

1129
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,240
breach because now your entire

1130
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,319
workstation smells like coffee

1131
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,240
and it might screw up your laptop this

1132
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,839
is key 90 degrees straight down smooth

1133
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,680
plunge

1134
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
using the aeropress there's a twist

1135
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,359
where you can do the inverted method

1136
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,520
where the paper filter is at the top you

1137
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,119
have the paper filter last

1138
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,760
the coffee sitting on the rubber plunger

1139
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
you agitate it stir it for a minute

1140
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,920
flip it over the sink if you have that

1141
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
luxury

1142
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,440
and then slowly press it through so you

1143
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,839
have a nice strong cup of coffee this

1144
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,920
works as well for

1145
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,280
cold brew and these again these slides

1146
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,640
are available

1147
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,319
espresso style drink it as it is

1148
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,040
american coffee

1149
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
add eight ounces of water to the mug to

1150
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,119
weaken it a latte

1151
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
just yeah i don't do that

1152
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,680
uh cold brew eight ounces per if you've

1153
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,079
got

1154
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,040
a heavy client load or you have teenage

1155
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
twins or newborn twins

1156
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
that's when you ramp up to the four five

1157
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,839
six shots of cold brew

1158
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,440
so you can stay awake for the diaper

1159
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,839
changing

1160
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,760
again the slides will be available

1161
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,800
the best cup of coffee is somebody one

1162
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,000
that somebody makes for you

1163
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,599
be grateful for the small things from

1164
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,520
kofi barista

1165
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
if you want a really good cup of coffee

1166
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,400
make two and share one

1167
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,760
because other people might bring a

1168
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,119
really bad cup of coffee and you're

1169
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,560
gonna have to act like you like it

1170
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,319
and i can't fake it

1171
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,440
my closing thought long-term success is

1172
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,400
like good coffee

1173
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,800
you skip a step slack on the process let

1174
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
somebody else do the grind for you and

1175
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,119
the results

1176
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,640
won't satisfy you you won't get the

1177
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
outcome you want do the grind

1178
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,800
follow the process stick to the process

1179
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,839
and you'll get great results

i did see one earlier back in the uh

1186
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,280
deeper part of things

1187
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,480
uh sorry not t for anticipating the next

1188
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,839
talk already

1189
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,240
uh here it is what do you think are the

1190
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,480
best ways for companies to prevent

1191
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,040
uh people self-justifying why it's okay

1192
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,880
to steal money from a corporation

1193
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
those kind of things from happening a

1194
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,920
county oversight

1195
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,560
the fraud prevention rules of having two

1196
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
people one person might handle the

1197
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,960
deposit

1198
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,400
the other person counts the money that

1199
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
goes on the deposit the separation of

1200
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,839
duties

1201
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,119
uh with the large corporation i'm in now

1202
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,880
all of the travel accounting is done

1203
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,040
[Music]

1204
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
through the corporate credit card with

1205
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,960
all receipts required period it's a pain

1206
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,359
but it's going to stop that level of

1207
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,359
fraud for the smaller ones for the pink

1208
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,079
color crop

1209
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,599
fraud again separation of duties are

1210
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,000
just

1211
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
story after story of the single threaded

1212
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,520
bookkeeper

1213
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,240
account handles the money from the

1214
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,920
soccer club handles the money from the

1215
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,359
collection plate

1216
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,200
they're able to siphon the cash off

1217
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,560
before it's accounted for

1218
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,400
because there's not a second set of eyes

1219
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,040
all right two-person controls excellent

1220
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,000
uh it looks like everyone else is mostly

1221
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,680
geeking out about their coffee

1222
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,119
preferences at the moment so you've

1223
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,040
certainly sparked a conversation

1224
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,079
over here uh oh here we go how do you

1225
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,040
ensure the team

1226
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,520
that's looking for the insiders are not

1227
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,079
the

1228
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,359
insider threat themselves

1229
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,920
who watches the watcher that was a

1230
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,760
philosophical question we had

1231
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,800
the client site they added me to the

1232
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
acls for the sensitive data and over the

1233
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,640
other side of the skiff not skip i'm

1234
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,319
sorry old life

1235
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,240
oversight the sock it was who's will

1236
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,839
bagging why does he have access to this

1237
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,440
i just hey guys i'm here

1238
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,240
um on the team now but you have random

1239
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
auditing and sampling of what they're

1240
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
doing

1241
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,480
and i found it generally in weasel words

1242
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,160
but generally self police is because

1243
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,319
we know we see the tools we know the

1244
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,839
access we know that everything is being

1245
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,520
logged

1246
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,359
we're not going to make those steps to

1247
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,800
do something malicious because hey

1248
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
losing a job in the pandemic me it's the

1249
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,240
wrong thing to do but hey you don't want

1250
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
to be unemployed in a pandemic

1251
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,920
you know that everything is logged so

1252
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,119
what i've seen in my experience of

1253
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,040
people working digital forensics insider

1254
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,680
threat

1255
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,560
or digital forensics in general the

1256
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,319
corporate laptop is a corporate laptop

1257
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,839
the corporate phone is a corporate phone

1258
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,680
and never the two shall mix because we

1259
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,079
know

1260
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,119
the oversight that's on us like my

1261
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:37,680

twitter on the corporate phone that

1269
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,040
could cause me to lose a job just

1270
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
because somebody sent out something

1271
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,720
sensitive yes indeed all right so

1272
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
