1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
we have eric up next with machine

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,080
learning vulnerabilities

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
and fabric choices two important

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,480
topics for any security consultant out

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,519
there today

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
who's going to be doing customer on-site

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,960
meetings so eric

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
i'm gonna pass it over to you thank you

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
for joining us today

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
yeah no happy to be here it was uh all

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
the talks so far have been amazing so

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,039
i'm glad that i get to go last

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
uh it's no pressure at all i'm gonna go

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
ahead and share some slides

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
that i made and we can just dive

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
right into it

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,559
cool so yeah

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
we're going to talk about machine

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,760
learning vulnerabilities and fabric

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,559
choices

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,640
and uh fabric choices was the best word

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,079
i could find but

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,120
we'll we'll delve in uh so first

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
who am i right i am a an ai researcher

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,920
at rapid seven

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
i'm a phd candidate at drexel university

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
uh in computer science focusing

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,079
specifically on

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,720
infosec and how it interacts with game

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,760
theory

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,320
uh i am allegedly writing a book i claim

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,159
to be writing a book i don't know if it

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
will ever be published uh i also do

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
stuff with the defcon

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
ai village and and probably other things

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
i'm sure there are other things that i

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,119
do

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,080
uh i have three children and a wonderful

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
partner i i do that too

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
so that's who i am uh and that that's

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
the boring part so

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
what is machine learning right that's

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,240
that's what's

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
really exciting to me uh and probably to

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
the rest of you

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
so it's a way to convince people that

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
your products

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
if them tree is something unique and

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,600
exciting

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
uh it is an incredibly cool and useful

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,280
technology

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
uh which is how i really feel about it

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
um

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
but something that's really important

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,079
for infosec people is that it's software

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,799
um it's all software right it's code

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,360
it's not

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
magic uh and so you know it's something

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
that makes your stunks go up but it also

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
really does do something with statistics

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,360
and this is a real forecast it's a time

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,239
series model

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
right um so in the talk we're gonna

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
cover what machine learning does and how

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
it gets deployed

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
and then we'll talk about

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
vulnerabilities some examples of those

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
vulnerabilities in mitigation

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,319
and then we're going to talk about

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,480
something that's on everybody's mind i'm

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,040
sure

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
which is what we're going to wear after

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
the pandemic right it's almost

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
maybe over i hope and we're all getting

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,360
vaccinated kind of

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
uh soon probably uh so we're gonna talk

77
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
about that

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,640
materials right different kinds of

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,920
fabrics

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,720
weaves knits and so on and then i'll

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
comment on why i'm always

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
so dressed up

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
so what does machine learning do well it

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
really it solves optimization problems

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
so there are three forms of machine

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,959
learning that's supervised

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
oops supervised learning which given an

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
input you find the parameters that let

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,040
the inputs best approximate the outputs

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,640
right this is like your y equals mx plus

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
b you have all of your x's and all of

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,360
your y's and you're trying to find the

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
m and the b that best fit it right that

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
line of best fit

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
you have unsupervised learning which is

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
that you get a bunch of data points and

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
you say well how are these similar how

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
do these relate to one another

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
uh and then you have something called

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
reinforcement learning

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,159
which you have an environment and you

102
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
bang against it until something good

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,799
happens

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,840
uh and i think of this as the roomba

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,400
model

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
of machine learning where like you have

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
your robot vacuum and

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
if it's if you've seen it it kind of

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
bangs against the wall until it figures

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
out which way to turn

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,040
that's how reinforcement learning works

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
in infosec most of our applications are

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
supervised

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,200
learning uh they're you know malware

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
classifiers and that sort of stuff

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
and some are unsupervised so that's our

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
clustering algorithms right

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
that's those are the applications that

119
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
we see in infosec

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,680
and so when we think about software and

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,079
we think about software vulnerabilities

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
a lot of it comes down to how it gets

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
deployed

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
so some of these technologies are

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
familiar to us they're

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
kubernetes and docker right

127
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
containerization

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
uh kubernetes and docker i guess i

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
should say kubernetes and compose

130
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,800
or container d and docker uh but

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
it's flask and django right rest apis

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,320
just

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
your regular python wrappers to

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
bang http requests against something

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,280
uh and then you have serverless right

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
serverless

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
uh that's like putting it your model

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
into an aws

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
lambda and kind of letting aws

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
or whoever handle those issues

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
but some of the technologies are less

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
familiar and these are technologies like

143
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
tensorflow extended tfx which is an api

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,639
for serving models and speeding up model

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,840
servers

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
and ml flow which is a platform for

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,039
managing and deploying your models

148
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,840
so i'll talk a little bit more about

149
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
these uh

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
right tensorflow extended has this

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,600
client

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
server model and so everything

153
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
in green is all of the

154
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
the wrappers that exist around

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
uh your machine learning model and the

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,759
only thing that's

157
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
actually the machine learning model is

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
that yellow bit that says tensorflow

159
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,880
servable

160
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
uh everything else is this api for

161
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
serving the model

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,120
and this is not a familiar technology to

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,759
a lot of infosec practitioners

164
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
so there's a whole lot of

165
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
architecture and infrastructure that we

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
need to dig in and understand

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,560
to kind of make sure that everything

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
is working properly and secure

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
but what ends up happening a lot of

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
times is that we

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,759
kind of gloss over the details because

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,479
uh

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
it's machine learning a bit scary but

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,680
really it's just

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
it's just software it's just another

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
framework like flask or django or

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,720
whatever

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
to understand how these models get

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,759
served and how

180
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
clients interact with them

181
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,639
and then like ml flow is another sort of

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,520
uh flavor of of serving these models

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,319
where you

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,680
have this model registry right that that

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
deals with all of the life cycle

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
management for

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
the models and then it gets served as a

188
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
rest endpoint so you have clients that

189
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
are sort of throwing

190
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
uh http requests against this rest

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,599
endpoint

192
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
and then it's interacting with your

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
model

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
and again the models are

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,919
software right and so

196
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,479
we dig into that and we think about

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,360
kinds of

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,440
classes of ml vulnerabilities that we

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,479
can see

200
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
so we have the vulnerabilities that crop

201
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
up in training

202
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
we have the vulnerabilities the crop up

203
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
in inference and then we have the

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,639
vulnerabilities that crop up in

205
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,599
deployment

206
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
and the ones that we tend to focus on

207
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,080
that get a lot of press

208
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
are the vulnerabilities in inference and

209
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
to some lesser extent vulnerabilities

210
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
and training

211
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
but the kind of vulnerabilities that

212
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,880
look the most

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
like what we know and will end up having

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,400
the biggest

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
impact or these vulnerabilities in

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
deployment

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,039
so i'll give some examples

218
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
vulnerabilities and training

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
our biggest one is model poisoning and

220
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,919
this

221
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
diagram is pulled directly from a paper

222
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,520
looking at that so what is model

223
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
poisoning it's when

224
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
bad data are injected into the training

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,879
data set

226
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
so you have a training data set and some

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
bad actor

228
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
has the ability to insert maliciously

229
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,840
chosen

230
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
points uh into your data set and well

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
why do they do that well they do that

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,680
because it forces misclassification

233
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
on these what these diagrams are showing

234
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,879
is that it

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
takes your decision boundary and it sort

236
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,160
of

237
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,599
shifts it over so that it starts

238
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,839
misclassifying

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,679
certain points

240
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
and some models are more vulnerable to

241
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
this than others

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
right you don't see this as much with

243
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
decision tree type models

244
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
you see this much more in support vector

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
machines

246
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
and in linear classifiers

247
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,399
and logistic regression these are super

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,519
vulnerable to that

249
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
kind of attack and

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
it's also really hard to detect because

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
if you have a bad etl

252
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,600
pipeline that's building a data set for

253
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,160
you

254
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
and you have this model that's being

255
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
trained on this

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
you know generated data set

257
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,519
the impact might be exactly the same

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,560
as somebody maliciously inserting bad

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,040
data

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
into your pipeline so you see this big

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,040
cluster of

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,240
red points on the far right on that

263
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
b diagram you could have something

264
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
right you could have an etl pipeline

265
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
that just assigns the same label to all

266
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
the points

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
and they end up getting clustered right

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
there and it messes up your decision

269
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
boundary

270
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
that's the same exact thing as somebody

271
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
maliciously

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
setting all of those uh points to have

273
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
the same value to move your decision

274
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,880
boundary

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
so it's really hard to detect this uh so

276
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
if we want to mitigate it

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
there are kind of two things that we can

278
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
do and that's integrity checking your

279
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,160
data set

280
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
so taking snapshots of your data sets

281
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
that are known good

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
uh and having just like a hash or

283
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,200
checksum

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
and seeing when your uh

285
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
data set changes right and then input

286
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,480
validation

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
checking sanity checking what gets input

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
into your data set

289
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
the same way that you would do input

290
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
validation on

291
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
a sql database or anything else that

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,839
you're doing there

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
right so when we talk about uh

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
vulnerabilities in

295
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
inference these are much cooler these

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
are what people get excited about

297
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,360
and i will talk more about these two

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
diagrams in a moment but

299
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
adversarial examples are specially

300
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
crafted samples they're

301
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
images or 3d objects or whatever that

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
you submit to a classifier

303
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
and the intent is that it forces them to

304
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
be misclassified

305
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
but it does it in a different way rather

306
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
than having the model

307
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,720
change to misclassify these samples

308
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
we specifically craft a sample that

309
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
forces misclassification

310
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
and in this sample on the right on the

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,519
top right

312
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
this is a 3d printed turtle and it was a

313
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,120
gif

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
that worked but uh it's not working

315
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,240
anymore

316
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
but it's from this paper that is called

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
the turtle rifle paper

318
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
and they 3d printed these researchers 3d

319
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,600
printed

320
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
a turtle that google cloud vision

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,600
classified as a rifle no matter how they

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
turned it no matter how they twisted it

323
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
um and like that has obvious impacts

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
right you don't

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
want your uh computer vision algorithm

326
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,440
to

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
think that a turtle is a firearm that

328
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,200
could

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
you know lead to pretty bad things

330
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
especially if you think about

331
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
plugging this sort of thing into cctv

332
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,920
right you have like a real big brother

333
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
scenario where it sees these 3d printed

334
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,440
turtles

335
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
and you get a ping that hey there's a

336
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,600
rifle on

337
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
you know such and such intersection and

338
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,800
you dispatch

339
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
police there and all of a sudden you

340
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,639
have a potential

341
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
you know real world issue to deal with

342
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
um so we can do it with these 3d objects

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
and we can also do it with

344
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
paper so the bottom this uh

345
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,320
granny smith apple with the word ipod on

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,079
a piece of paper

347
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,880
stuck to it is from a recent paper out

348
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,200
of

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,320
the open ai research group and they

350
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,360
found

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,480
that uh essentially this computer vision

352
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
algorithm that they developed

353
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
over generalizes it's too good it's too

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
clever so when it sees

355
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
uh ipod right it goes oh yeah i know

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
what an ipod is that's an ipod

357
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
uh rather than contextually

358
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
you know looking at it and being like i

359
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
don't care what that word is that's an

360
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,000
apple

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
right it's actually reading and

362
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,360
trying to infer based on what it's

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
reading

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
which is uh a little terrifying and and

365
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
kind of funny um so the math is very

366
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
cool but the impact

367
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
is is often not very exciting so the

368
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839
math is what gets me

369
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,639
really hyped um there's all kinds of

370
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
cool things around information geometry

371
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
and gradients and incredibly boring

372
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
stuff

373
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,000
uh that excites uh like six people

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,560
um but the impact of these attacks is

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,199
often

376
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,839
like not super exciting if we think

377
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,240
about

378
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
an adversarial example in the infosec

379
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,639
context

380
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,839
you could use um something like

381
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
reinforcement learning which is uh what

382
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
some researchers that i think it's end

383
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
game

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
and hopefully they'll yell at me if i'm

385
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
wrong did

386
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,000
they used reinforcement learning to kind

387
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
of bang malware samples against

388
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
uh virustotal until one didn't get

389
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,480
detected by any of the av engines and

390
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
then it was like okay well now i've

391
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,880
evaded

392
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,240
you know detection but of course

393
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,279
once that malware goes out into the wild

394
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,519
uh heuristic detections and signatures

395
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,800
will be written and

396
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,399
so it's not really that exciting

397
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,680
um so the impact right or the mitigation

398
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
if you

399
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,720
don't want adversarial examples to work

400
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,880
uh sort of the two best techniques for

401
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,839
avoiding that

402
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
are things that your data scientists or

403
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
your ml engineers are going to need to

404
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,480
do

405
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
and that's using adversarial training

406
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
where it generates these adversarial

407
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
examples and says hey classify these

408
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
correctly

409
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
and that sort of smooths out the

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,360
decision boundary

411
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
and ensemble voting where you have a

412
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,680
bunch of

413
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
models running together and it's hard to

414
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
craft adversarial examples that are

415
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
going to

416
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,720
defeat both a decision tree and a neural

417
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
network

418
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
and a support vector machine and so they

419
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,040
vote

420
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,240
and the majority um

421
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
of models that decide on a class is the

422
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
class that it surfaces

423
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,240
yeah but the real vulnerabilities

424
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
uh that are scary in machine learning

425
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,760
that again i think we don't talk enough

426
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,399
about

427
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
are the vulnerabilities uh the actual

428
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
vulnerabilities right

429
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
and so these are vulnerabilities in

430
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,160
server architectures

431
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,959
so these are just vulnerabilities in

432
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
django flask

433
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,399
and i think docker

434
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,880
vulnerabilities in your machine learning

435
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,639
library this is a big one

436
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
and this is something that that really

437
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,199
doesn't get a lot of exposure because

438
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,079
it's mostly

439
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
lived in academic circles but we've had

440
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
vulnerabilities in machine learning

441
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,759
libraries

442
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
where you have denial of service

443
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
conditions and memory corruption

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,399
vulnerabilities

445
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,160
that happen when the model does certain

446
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,040
things

447
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
so if we think back to that ml flow or

448
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,199
that

449
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,880
tfx example uh if you're not

450
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,120
thoroughly auditing that architecture

451
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
because you know oh well i don't know

452
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
what this is it's machine learning um

453
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
and so you have basically unvalidated

454
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,800
input

455
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,759
going into something that could have

456
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
vulnerable libraries

457
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
well that's a huge concern

458
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
so knowing what your machine learning

459
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
algorithms

460
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
are doing the libraries that they're

461
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,279
using

462
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,519
and actually gaining some familiarity

463
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
with commonly used libraries like

464
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,199
tensorflow pytorch

465
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
scikit-learn can really help us

466
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,560
you know keep these vulnerabilities out

467
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,199
because even if you are able to validate

468
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,160
that server architecture that's letting

469
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
your models basically be exposed to the

470
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
world

471
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
knowing the vulnerabilities within those

472
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
libraries is going to help protect us a

473
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
lot

474
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,240
then we have vulnerabilities in the

475
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,679
model itself

476
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
this is a cool one so this particular

477
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,599
cve

478
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,799
corresponds to

479
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,240
a vulnerability in the i think it was

480
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,919
proof point email security appliance um

481
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,880
moo hax

482
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
will pierce did a phenomenal

483
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,400
presentation at derbycon

484
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
i want to say two years ago three years

485
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
ago um

486
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
talking about this vulnerability he

487
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,160
created a copycat model

488
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,120
and basically used information that the

489
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,919
model was

490
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,799
leaking to craft phishing emails that

491
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,200
bypassed the email security appliance

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
uh super cool it's a talk all unto

493
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,960
itself

494
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
uh you know drop me a dm

495
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
or drop something in the channel i'll

496
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
link it to you it's it's really cool

497
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
um but this is another like real

498
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
vulnerability

499
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
uh and then another vulnerability that

500
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,880
was actually

501
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,160
just pushed out by trail of bits

502
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
is this thing called fickling so

503
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
a lot of these ml models

504
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,520
when they get saved are pickled we use

505
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,840
the pickle library to save these models

506
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,799
and pickling is of course a form of

507
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,120
serialization

508
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
so this opens us up to some post-hoc

509
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
manipulation that you can do of these

510
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,679
saved

511
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,039
ml models to create deserialization

512
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,320
vulnerabilities

513
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
and it's it's really really cool and

514
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,559
really really terrifying

515
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
um and i'm looking forward to more

516
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
research coming out on these sorts of

517
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
deserialization vulnerabilities

518
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,960
um so mitigating

519
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
these vulnerabilities right uh patching

520
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
and that includes

521
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,520
patching your machine learning libraries

522
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
patching your models

523
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,720
to be updated to use these uh

524
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
updated machine learning libraries and

525
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,120
this can be a problem because a lot of

526
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,200
times

527
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
these libraries have very specific

528
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,760
functions that get deprecated but

529
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,120
because they're written by data

530
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
scientists and not security people

531
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
or software engineers they just ignore

532
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
the deprecation warnings

533
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,039
the number of ml models you'll see that

534
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,919
just ignore

535
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
all warnings is truly horrifying

536
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
so eventually you say well okay well

537
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
we're pinned to this version we're stuck

538
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,720
on this version

539
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
and that version may have right some

540
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
real vulnerabilities in it

541
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,080
so then you have to think about model

542
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
assessment

543
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
right actually uh trying to pen

544
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,880
test your models trying to get see if

545
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
these fickling attacks

546
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
uh will work or if the model itself is

547
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,559
leaking

548
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
information that could lead to it being

549
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,679
bypassed

550
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,760
and then of course systems testing right

551
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
not just unit testing but testing how

552
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,120
everything works together and input

553
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,000
validation

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
it should go without saying but a lot of

555
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,039
models get deployed to the internet

556
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,159
and do no input validation they just

557
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,720
let you upload an image and they don't

558
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
do any file magic checking or anything

559
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
like that

560
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
they just let you basically input

561
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
arbitrary data

562
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
to a machine learning model

563
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
uh and as we know that's not really

564
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
the best thing to do so um

565
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
i'm gonna transition very smoothly here

566
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,360
uh

567
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
but if everything is ai do i still need

568
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
to wear pants i know that's what you're

569
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,760
thinking

570
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
after me talking about those

571
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
vulnerabilities because this was a very

572
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
casual segue

573
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,240
um and yes you you probably will have to

574
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
wear pants you might be able to get away

575
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,280
with wearing skirts

576
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
or dresses but you will probably have to

577
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,240
wear something on your legs

578
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
but you don't have to wear jeans your

579
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
jeans are terrible

580
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
jeans are terrible and i'm going to make

581
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
that argument here

582
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,039
if you like jeans you're free to wear

583
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
them uh these are

584
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
pictures of of people who wear clothes

585
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,320
that i like

586
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
um yeah so first i want to talk about

587
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
materials

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
uh and this slide was messed up so i'm

589
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
just gonna reveal it um

590
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
so we've got kind of these three

591
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
materials so we've got our

592
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,960
cotton right and everybody knows cotton

593
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,000
it's very common

594
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,559
it's usually pretty inexpensive uh it's

595
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
very familiar

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
and there are tons of weaves of cotton

597
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,880
that we're going to get into

598
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
you've got linen which is uh produced

599
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
from the hemp plant

600
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
not hemp flaxseed plant and

601
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,520
um i'm not just talking about bed sheets

602
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
but linen sheets do rule

603
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
linen starts out very scratchy but it

604
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
becomes buttery soft

605
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,919
and the prices of linen can range from

606
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,880
extremely

607
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,200
cheap to insanely expensive

608
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
um but it's

609
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,559
all good um especially in the summer

610
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,799
the only caveat with linen is that it

611
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,400
wrinkles

612
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,960
horribly it's incredibly wrinkly but if

613
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
you embrace

614
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
the wrinkle life uh it's it's a

615
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
wonderful fabric again especially when

616
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,679
it's

617
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,360
humid out um wool gets a bad reputation

618
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,960
and i'm going to talk a lot more about

619
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
wool later there's tons of variation in

620
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
wolves there are tons of variation in

621
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,799
prices

622
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,919
and you can wear wool all year all year

623
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,320
it's my favorite fabric i am currently

624
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,960
wearing

625
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
uh head to toe wool my socks are wool

626
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
my pants are wool this jacket is wool

627
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
it's all wool

628
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
um it's my favorite fabric

629
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,840
so let's talk about corduroy

630
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,200
um corduroy has a mythical origin the

631
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,159
cult dua which is my terrible french

632
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,200
apologies to

633
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
all french people and canadians

634
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
listening uh

635
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
the chord of the king right but in real

636
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,960
life it's actually

637
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
an industrial workwear fabric and

638
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,919
so the cords in the corduroy

639
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
right you can see them there i picked a

640
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,440
really thick

641
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
plush whale is what it's called

642
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,760
so thicker whale is usually softer it

643
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
has that nice nap

644
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,679
you can like see it if you rub your hand

645
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,640
up it

646
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
um and thin whale is very hard wearing

647
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,400
that's like it's hard to put holes in

648
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
thin whale corduroy

649
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,360
it's just as tough as jeans uh just as

650
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
tough as denim

651
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,360
um and corduroy short shirts exist

652
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,120
shorts exist too

653
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,679
but shirts exist and corduroy shirts are

654
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,000
a really nice way to add some texture

655
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,559
to an outfit i really like corduroy

656
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
shirts

657
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,480
they have thin whale corduroy shirts

658
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,919
that are super lightweight that are

659
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,360
great for the summer

660
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,720
uh really really i love corduroy

661
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,159
and one of my favorite things about

662
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,000
corduroy is that it's very easy to

663
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,679
dress up or it's very easy to wear

664
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
casually it's really just about what you

665
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,400
wear with

666
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
it um you know a pair of corduroys with

667
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,480
a t-shirt

668
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
and like a denim jacket is of super

669
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,000
great

670
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
workwear look that is very casual

671
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
uh but like they make corduroy

672
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
suits uh that look really good actually

673
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,279
um so the next cotton fabric or cotton

674
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
weave i want to talk about is peak

675
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,400
peak is like polo shirt material if you

676
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,559
have a polo shirt if you own

677
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,360
any polo shirt that isn't like an under

678
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,120
armour or a nike polo

679
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
it is probably cotton peak

680
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
and the reason for that is because

681
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
they're great for the summer it's a very

682
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,440
breathable material

683
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,000
um you can see kind of that texture

684
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
you've got like

685
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,679
the little air pockets in it you can

686
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,320
really get

687
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,480
air through it it's almost like a mesh

688
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,840
kind of weave

689
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
um but not mesh enough that you're not

690
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,840
allowed to wear it to work

691
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
and like they make polos on a peak but

692
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,120
um

693
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,919
what the real secret with peak is is uh

694
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,520
sweatshirts

695
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
because sometimes you get like those

696
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,120
cool breezy summer nights

697
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
and you want something that lets you

698
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
live through the humidity

699
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,840
but not be cold if the wind blows

700
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,880
um and i will say peak pants have a very

701
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
interesting texture

702
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,440
they can be difficult to find but uh

703
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
cotton peak as pants make a very

704
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,960
interesting texture

705
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,600
and they're super cool uh especially in

706
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,000
like

707
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
dark colors it gives a really nice uh

708
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
nice look and cotton cashmere peak

709
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
is cozy it is a really good fabric

710
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
again especially for like late spring

711
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
early summer maybe into fall

712
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,400
it's really really good kind of those

713
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,279
transitional seasons

714
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
um oxford oxford is

715
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,279
another cotton i want to talk about when

716
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,159
you think

717
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,360
oxford you think oxford button-down

718
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,919
shirts right oxford cloth button downs

719
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,039
uh are practically a meme on

720
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,520
the fashion internet especially like the

721
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,080
menswear

722
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,520
internet uh our male fashion advice on

723
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,080
reddit

724
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,760
it's ocbd is a well understood acronym

725
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,919
and i wear them all the time not right

726
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,279
now uh

727
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,520
but i wear them a lot and you know they

728
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
look nice enough

729
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,480
but it's a it's a durable fabric you can

730
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
wear an oxford cloth button down

731
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,640
for ever and they get softer with wear

732
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,520
they're they're really durable shirts

733
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,000
they can

734
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
hold on for a long time uh and

735
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
another nice thing about oxford is it's

736
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,240
surprisingly resistant to wrinkles

737
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
so you can wear oxford cloth shirts

738
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,360
under

739
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
sport coats or whatever right if you're

740
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
on a client-facing engagement nobody is

741
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,120
going to

742
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
pooh-pooh you for wearing a an oxford

743
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
cloth shirt

744
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
um but you're going to be sitting down

745
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
all day you're going to be in a car

746
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
you're going to be in like six ubers and

747
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,640
it should

748
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,440
stay unwrinkled so that you can you know

749
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
reasonably wear it

750
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
again uh the next day without having to

751
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,240
iron it

752
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,679
if you uh you know are into that

753
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,919
uh and it comes in a lot of weights

754
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
right so when you think about fabric

755
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
weight it's how thick it is

756
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
um you can have really thin oxford

757
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,880
shirts that are

758
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,039
you know better for the summer and you

759
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,320
can have really heavy

760
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,600
like 14 gram oxford shirts and those are

761
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,399
going to be

762
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,000
uh almost canvas-like

763
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,039
in their thickness

764
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
and yeah it's usually a shirting fabric

765
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
but they do make oxford pants

766
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
uh i have owned oxford pants there's

767
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,679
nothing wrong with oxford pants

768
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,799
yeah but it's usually seen as a shirting

769
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,880
fabric

770
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
so broadcloth and poplin

771
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,720
are the next cotton fabric i want to

772
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,679
talk about

773
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,200
it's very smooth it is a smooth

774
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,320
kind of basket be of cotton

775
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,679
cotton fabric so

776
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,399
one thing with broadcloth and poplin is

777
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,240
that there are two names for the same

778
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,960
weave

779
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
but broadcloth yarns are thicker and

780
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
poplin yarns are thinner

781
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,320
so broadcloth is good for like

782
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,840
uh right it's much dressier than oxford

783
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,399
so it's a good dress shirt fabric if

784
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
you're going to a wedding

785
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
in the summer you want to wear poplin if

786
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
you're going to

787
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,360
a wedding in the fall or spring or

788
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,000
winter

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,880
you might want to wear brown cloth

790
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
because it's going to be heavier

791
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
and it's it's both much cooler than

792
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,679
oxford

793
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,840
so either one of them is going to be

794
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
cooler wearing

795
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,760
uh broadcloth and oxford of the same

796
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,399
weight

797
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
broadcloth is going to be cooler wearing

798
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
because of that basket weave

799
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,440
and then cotton twill is the next fabric

800
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
i want to hit on

801
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
and cotton twill it's super common pant

802
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,480
fabric

803
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,640
you probably own cotton twill fabric

804
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,440
as a matter of fact almost all chinos

805
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,320
which is like

806
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,480
dockers or khakis or whatever

807
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
uh you call them or your you know

808
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,640
friends call them uh they're all cotton

809
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,600
twill

810
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,520
they're they're all cotton twill and so

811
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,840
uh recently there have been a lot more

812
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
blends

813
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,440
with elastane or spandex for stretch

814
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,000
which is

815
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,880
super nice

816
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
there was a lot of stigma around

817
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,200
blending these stretch materials into

818
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,840
cotton twill for a long time

819
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,159
and i'm very very glad that people have

820
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,200
come around to it

821
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
and it's just a comfortable classic

822
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,679
year-round fabric

823
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
it comes in a million colors

824
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,640
any color you want chinos in

825
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,080
they they come in think of a color

826
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
it comes in it um and so

827
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,679
linen is the next fabric i want to talk

828
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,039
about we're done with cotton

829
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,880
we're talking about linen because it is

830
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,080
starting to get hot

831
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
uh i'm down in north carolina so it's

832
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
already hot but it'll be cold

833
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
in two days or something i don't know i

834
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
just moved here i don't understand it

835
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,840
yet

836
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,880
uh but it's warming up so linen is great

837
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
and uh it gets very wrinkled i talked

838
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,799
about this earlier

839
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,440
um as soon as you put on linen it will

840
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,480
be wrinkled

841
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
you either need to embrace the wrinkle

842
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,519
life

843
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
or keep a very hot iron nearby

844
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,320
all the time it starts out scratchy

845
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
and that's especially true if it's poor

846
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,240
quality linen

847
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,799
but the good news is it gets really

848
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,559
really soft with wear

849
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,200
even if it's poor quality so if you put

850
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
on a linen shirt because you watched

851
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,960
this talk and you were like

852
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,799
i would like to wear a linen shirt this

853
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,120
seems great and you put it on your body

854
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
and it's incredibly uncomfortable and

855
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:43,679
you

856
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
write me a mean email i will understand

857
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,120
but i will reassure you that if you just

858
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,720
wear it and wash it um it will

859
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,559
soften up and it will become your

860
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,600
favorite thing another thing about linen

861
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
is you can get linen everything you can

862
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,760
wear all linen outfits

863
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,039
uh shirts sweaters i have a linen jacket

864
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,440
uh trousers they they all look great

865
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,399
it's all great

866
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,600
um linen has a really nice drape the

867
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,720
wrinkles again

868
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
like once you embrace them they're kind

869
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
of fun it gives you like a very

870
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,080
loose non nonchalant look it's

871
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
it's really nice i love linen linen

872
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,120
dresses

873
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,360
and skirts also i should not

874
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,559
be so focused on what i wear but linen

875
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,559
skirts and dresses also exist

876
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,000
and i assume are just as wonderful

877
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,960
so whoa okay we're going to finish this

878
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,240
whole presentation we're going to talk

879
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,279
about wool

880
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,039
uh there are many many many types of

881
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,039
wool there's lamb's wool

882
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,880
so there are different types of sheep

883
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,240
different breeds of sheep

884
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
have different types of wool so there's

885
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,760
uh

886
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
shetland wool and merino wool

887
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,480
are two common types so shetland wool

888
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,519
is that like scratchy

889
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,799
curly wool that you probably imagine

890
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,080
when you think of like wool

891
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,200
sweaters um

892
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,360
and you know there's regular lamb's wool

893
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,480
that is also

894
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,159
kind of like that and then there's

895
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,519
merino wool

896
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,880
merino wool is much smoother it's much

897
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,440
nicer

898
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
it's pleasant to wear against your skin

899
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,480
it's very temperature regulating

900
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
merino wool is incredible

901
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,880
um really really cool stuff

902
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,720
and then you have wool from basically

903
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,919
any animal

904
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,440
that has hair uh alpaca wool is super

905
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,559
soft it's lovely mo hair

906
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,679
if you've ever seen a photograph of like

907
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,000
somebody in a tuxedo and it just looks

908
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,760
amazing it's like a nighttime tuxedo

909
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,559
photo

910
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,919
it's probably a mohair talks

911
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
it photographs incredibly it drapes

912
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
beautifully it's very temperature

913
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,480
regulating

914
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,599
it's not super comfortable

915
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,199
but it looks great cashmere i assume

916
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,399
that most people are familiar with

917
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,199
cashmere

918
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
cashmere is very soft it is very

919
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,119
pleasant angora

920
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
comes from the angora rabbit

921
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,480
it is very soft and they do not have to

922
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
harm the bunny to take its fur

923
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,839
so it is uh about as ethical as any

924
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,239
other

925
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,280
animal based fabric uh and camel hair

926
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,760
camel is actually a really really nice

927
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,520
material it's very soft

928
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,639
feels great looks great i love love

929
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,679
camel it is pricey

930
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,000
so why is wool so scratchy

931
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,079
right and here are some incredibly

932
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
scratchy sweaters

933
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,400
for the illustration uh so

934
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,040
well number one is the type of wool

935
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,760
right

936
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,599
mourinho cashmere and angora are

937
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,920
actually easy to wear against the skin

938
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,079
but something like what's over here on

939
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,000
the right which are as far as i can tell

940
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,320
all shetland sweaters uh is not

941
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,960
then there's quality which is of course

942
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,680
a factor

943
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,680
right uh even merino wool if you get

944
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,960
one of those like uniqlo

945
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,119
merino wool sweaters it may be a little

946
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
bit scratchy at first because it doesn't

947
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,000
have as much

948
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
lanolin it's it's really mass-produced

949
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,520
they use like really cheap stuff

950
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,640
uniqlo in particular uh also uses slave

951
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,440
labor

952
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,200
so not the best company

953
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,680
and then weave weave is a big factor

954
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
that's like your knit

955
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,320
right you're probably thinking of itchy

956
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,480
wool sweaters which which are knit

957
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,680
from lambswool so

958
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,920
we're going to talk about these these

959
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,960
fabrics right

960
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,560
these weaves these knits that you have

961
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
in wool and the first is flannel i want

962
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,000
to talk about

963
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,320
wool flannel my pants are wool flannel

964
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
they look just like the ones on top

965
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
and funnel does not describe a plaid

966
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,160
cotton shirt

967
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,320
it is a gentle nap on a soft wall

968
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,119
so there are different grades of wool

969
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,520
and

970
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
i don't have nearly enough time to go

971
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,119
into all of

972
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,560
them uh and how much i love wool but

973
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
when somebody talks about a wool flannel

974
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,320
uh it's usually a

975
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,040
just a gentle nap it's got like a little

976
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,760
bit of

977
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,839
hair to it right if you pull it one way

978
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,200
or push it another

979
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
it kind of goes up and down with the

980
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,359
hairs

981
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,040
that's what a wool flannel is

982
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
and wolf flannel pants are softer than

983
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,880
cheap sweats

984
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,079
and they look way better um literally

985
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,000
i've been wearing these pants all day

986
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
i curled up uh on the little egg chair

987
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
we have outside with my partner

988
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
they are just as comfortable as cheap

989
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
sweatpants

990
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,160
and they look a million times better

991
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,359
and worsted wool flannels make great

992
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,560
suits this

993
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
jacket is worsted wool and uh

994
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,119
i know how we feel as infosec people

995
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,520
about

996
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
suits uh in general but

997
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
they make great suits and if you're

998
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
looking for a suit

999
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,280
you should take care to look for worsted

1000
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,320
wool flannels

1001
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
that's going to be your most flexible

1002
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,720
most comfortable option

1003
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,040
because i know that comfort is paramount

1004
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,119
next type of wool i want to talk about

1005
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,960
is the tropical wool

1006
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,079
so you can see that kind of almost

1007
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,280
basket weave in that tropical wool

1008
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
so it's a very lightweight wool

1009
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,560
they use really light wool fibers and

1010
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,920
they weave it

1011
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,880
in that basket weave it's highly

1012
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,800
temperature regulating so you've got

1013
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,599
air flow in and out and wool in general

1014
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,640
is very temperature regulating because

1015
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
i mean i don't know it is i don't know

1016
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,520
the science i'm sorry

1017
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,079
but tropical wool is great for the

1018
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,240
summer and it's great for humidity

1019
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
yes wool in the summer it's uh

1020
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,920
second to linen only it is absolutely

1021
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
one of my favorite things to wear in the

1022
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,760
summer it feels like i'm wearing nothing

1023
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,640
at all

1024
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,480
it's just incredible

1025
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,480
and so the third and i believe

1026
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,119
final will weave is twill so wool twills

1027
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,640
are fantastic cotton twills right it's

1028
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,680
that chino

1029
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,640
you can see here these sort of diagonal

1030
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320
weave patterns that you

1031
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,320
also saw with the uh cotton twill uh but

1032
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
in this case it's wool

1033
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,040
so it's just like cotton twill and it

1034
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
drapes

1035
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
beautifully and when i talk about drape

1036
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,760
i mean like you put it on your body kind

1037
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,079
of the way that it hangs on your body

1038
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,760
um the way that the twill sits

1039
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
it just looks great on everybody

1040
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,640
um the accent the

1041
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,480
just the way that it says is incredible

1042
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,720
uh it photographs incredibly too

1043
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,560
and when you walk it kind of moves with

1044
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
you it's awesome

1045
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,119
um there are two primary types of wool

1046
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,079
twill

1047
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,400
so there's cavalry twill which is that

1048
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,599
double twill

1049
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
and you can see in the left picture

1050
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,599
right you've kind of got like

1051
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,720
two lines going through it

1052
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,680
that's a cavalry twill and then you have

1053
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,480
whip cord which is on the right

1054
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,280
and that's a single twill so cavalry

1055
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,320
twill as the name implies comes from

1056
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,040
horseback riding right it is designed

1057
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,599
not

1058
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,720
to uh you know not to get messed up when

1059
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
you're sitting on a saddle

1060
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,880
so that's probably good enough for

1061
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,720
sitting in a chair

1062
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
or for going out to lunch uh whip cord

1063
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
is designed not to get snagged on

1064
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
um branches it's a hunting fabric is its

1065
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,560
origin

1066
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,640
and so they're they're super hard

1067
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,760
wearing and they will

1068
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,280
almost always get compliments

1069
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,920
so now that you know how wonderful wool

1070
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
and linen

1071
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,160
and cotton fabrics are you never need to

1072
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,280
wear jeans again

1073
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,720
you are free too but you never need to

1074
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
jeans are stiff pants they're designed

1075
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,560
for working outdoors

1076
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,920
um and you're probably more of an indoor

1077
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
creature

1078
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,520
chinos are comfortable they're softer

1079
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,079
they they move more nicely because the

1080
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,560
uh the twill weave is a little bit

1081
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,880
easier than the warp and weft

1082
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
of denim and again they come in

1083
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,319
any color and cut on earth you could

1084
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,119
possibly want

1085
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
wool flannel trousers are secretly

1086
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,839
sweatpants nobody will know

1087
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,079
the outfit that i'm wearing is basically

1088
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,280
a t-shirt

1089
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,800
and sweats uh but nobody knows

1090
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
and it's great it's the best best

1091
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,520
uh secret on earth and there's nothing

1092
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,079
wrong

1093
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,480
with t-shirts and jeans but you might be

1094
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,599
actually physically

1095
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,920
more comfortable in some of these

1096
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,359
alternatives

1097
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,160
um and don't be afraid to ask for help

1098
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,560
uh

1099
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,680
right like in stores or from people

1100
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
if you're like hey i would like to wear

1101
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,079
other clothes but

1102
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,319
i've worn t-shirts and jeans my whole

1103
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,119
life

1104
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,560
and it just feels like the default uh

1105
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,079
casual clothing option

1106
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,359
what do i do uh you know people who like

1107
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,960
clothes typically love to help um

1108
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
so yeah that's that's all i've got thank

1109
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,119

anybody have any questions

1119
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,960
i don't have any flagged in the chat i

1120
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,400
see lots of comments about how

1121
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,240
everybody's realized their style game is

1122
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,480
about to be upgraded but

1123
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,359
well that is incredible josh josh says

1124
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,160
he's adding it

1125
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,000
on twitter right now for fashion advice

1126
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
well i guess i'll have to start posting

1127
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,839
uh actual fashion advice on twitter

1128
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,960
instead of uh you know i've got about 11

1129
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,040
pages of people saying oh i was doing

1130
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
that wrong all along but i don't see any

1131
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,839
questions

1132
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,760
so i think people are just excited about

1133
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
seeing more from you in this in this

1134
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,400
arena

1135
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
on both topics so we actually just saw a

1136
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,640
question from emily and i would

1137
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
really yeah there we go yes have you

1138
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
have you worked with people in

1139
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
with sensory issues and do they share

1140
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
your opinions

1141
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
uh yeah so my wife has horrific sensory

1142
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,839
issues and so does my middle son um

1143
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,359
and so they don't love wool

1144
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,119
we have to be a lot more conscious of

1145
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,200
the fabric choices that they're wearing

1146
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,560
my wife is really sensitive to basically

1147
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
all natural fibers so she does have to

1148
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,800
work with like

1149
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,520
cotton poly blends but we found a lot of

1150
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,359
success with like high quality

1151
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,960
linen as well um as long as it's

1152
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,760
it gets past that scratchy phase it's

1153
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,040
it's really good

1154
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,240
um but again like cotton peak is good

1155
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,359
and cotton twills have been good um

1156
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,599
but she does wear a lot of t-shirts and

1157
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,520
jeans um

1158
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,720
so that's that's wonderful and you had a

1159
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,400
perfect answer for that as well thank

1160
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:02,800
you

1161
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,160
there's another question here from

1162
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,720
andrew you talked about an optimization

1163
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
problem and andrew

1164
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,839
is asking if that's a common term that

1165
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,359
that andrew should know

1166
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,560
or if it's a niche one yeah i maybe i

1167
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,599
was a little bit too

1168
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,319
uh cavalier with my use of just an

1169
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,680
optimization problem

1170
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,720
uh never use the word just um

1171
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,440
so when i say optimization problem i

1172
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,319
mean like

1173
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,599
minimizing or maximizing a value so

1174
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,480
in machine learning in particular you

1175
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,880
have

1176
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,599
a loss function which is basically like

1177
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,880
how far away i

1178
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
am from from the value so if you think

1179
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,800
of like your classic

1180
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,599
y equals mx plus b linear algebra

1181
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,640
problem

1182
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,760
um when you take m and y

1183
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
and you try and calculate that

1184
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,960
difference right you have a bunch of

1185
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,319
them

1186
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,359
the distance that your default value of

1187
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,920
m is say you set m equal to one so it's

1188
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,640
just y

1189
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
equals x how far away

1190
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,359
your predicted y is from your actual y

1191
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,200
value is your loss it's your error

1192
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,680
and so minimizing that is the

1193
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,200
optimization problem

1194
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,560
you want to find parameters that

1195
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,599
minimize that loss

1196
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,000
so you're as unwrong as you can be

1197
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
perfect thank you so much really

1198
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,800
appreciate your time and

1199
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,480
sharing a topic that was apparently

1200
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,240
something that was really on people's

1201
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,520
minds

1202
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
really appreciate it yeah absolutely

1203
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,800
thank you so much i really appreciate

1204
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,560
you having me
