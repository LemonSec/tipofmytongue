questions

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,480
i've designed this to be very casual so

questions

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
so the impetus to this talk

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
comes from this thought that i had

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,239
and that's god creates dinosaurs god

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
destroys dinosaurs

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,080
god creates man man destroys god

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
man creates steganography steganography

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,479

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,280

introduction to

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
about myself we will discuss what

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,040
steganography

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
is i will give you some examples of how

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
my basic workflow goes as far as how i

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
look at steganography challenges

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
and we will also be taking a look at

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
some stegosaurus information of course

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
so we will have a stegano

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,399
stegosaurus encounter provided on the

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,119
tour

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,800
and then obviously after tour pancakes

i spoke at hope 2020 i was recently

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,680
published in 2600 magazine

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
most of my content up until now has been

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
mostly social engineering related but

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,159
i'm starting to branch out into some

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
other creative and interesting

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,760
aspects of cyber security so

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
look forward to that content i also

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,799
created

88
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,400
one of my first projects during the

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
lockdown which was called osek which is

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,159
the open source social engineering

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,519
education course

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
uh that project was just me walking

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
through uh three books it's

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
kind of like a really highly structured

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
book club

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
uh books like how to win friends and

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
influence people by dale carnegie

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,239
code of trust by robin dreak and at the

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
at the time the science of human hacking

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
by uh christopher hadnagy which has been

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
updated to the human hacking book so

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
i may have to change your seek i also

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,200
have my own

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
independent consultancy website

105
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,439
muralabs.info

106

i don't market myself i'm terrible at

107
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,799
business

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,680

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
information security

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639

breaches mod

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
for tabletop simulator so i'm working

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
with them to develop that so if you have

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,160
tabletop simulator

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
and you want to play backdoors and

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
breeches it's totally available for free

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
on the workshop so i recommend you

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
definitely check that out

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
so just kick back and relax in your

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,759
vehicle

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
if you have any questions direct those

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
to your

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
in-vehicle guide angela who's with us

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,160
and uh

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,840
we'll go ahead and head into pancakes

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
park

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
hold on to your butts

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,639
okay so i've went ahead and started the

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,960
tour program so everything will be

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
managed remotely here from the control

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
room

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
we've spared no expense no problems

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,680
whatsoever

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
you're going to have a great time let's

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
talk about steganography what is

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
steganography

141
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
this is one of those things that

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
you can learn about on multiple levels

143
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
right if you've done any capture the

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
flag competitions it's

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
it's likely that you have come across a

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
steganography challenge

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
but i i just want you to know that

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
cryptography as a field and

149
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
steganography as like a domain of

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
cryptography um you could spend your

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
whole career focused on just that

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,320
so this is just a primer on the subject

153
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
of steganography it's really

154
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
geared towards a student level

155
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
doing ctfs and crypto challenges so

156
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
not super super high level technical

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
stuff here which is definitely possible

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,840
we're just going to touch the tip of the

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,000
iceberg

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
so of course i went ahead and accessed

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
the

162
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy aka

163
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
wikipedia

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
so wikipedia defines steganography in

165
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
this way it's the practice

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
of concealing a file message image or

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
video within another file so

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,680
stigmatography is used to hide secrets

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,800
in plain sight

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
and it's a way to send messages without

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
anyone detecting that a message

172
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,680
has even been sent and this

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
principle i'll call it that because

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
there are many ways to apply

175
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
steganography

176
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
as a tool it goes back thousands of

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
years and one of the first examples of

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
it was

179
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
the romans would shave the head of a

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,000
messenger

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
tattoo a message on the head of the

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,599
messenger

183
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
and then send that messenger to

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
somewhere else right

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,319
and the premise there that by the time

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,199
the messenger

187
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
gets there or maybe gets captured by the

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
enemy the hair has

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
regrown on top of the head hiding the

190
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
message right there in plain sight

191
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
another way that you may have

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
experienced steganography and not

193
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,919
realize it is through the use of

194
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
invisible ink

195
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
so the message is right there in plain

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
sight it's just hidden within another

197
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,240
message

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
some other analog examples of

199
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
steganography would be

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
knots tied into ropes messages hidden

201
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
under stamps on envelopes

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,240
um mix typeface is a common way

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
uh using a grill cipher a grill cipher

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
is i want you to imagine a movie scene

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,440
where someone's looking at a letter and

206
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
then they have a piece of cardboard with

207
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,440
a bunch of holes cut out on it and i

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,039
should have provided a visual for this

209
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,400
and i apologize

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
but imagine they overlay the piece of

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,960
cardboard on top of the

212
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
letter and it only reveals certain

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
letters or words

214
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
that's that's a grill cipher so that's a

215
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,199
way to

216
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
implement steganography also

217
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
this is an interesting way that it's

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
been done and it's

219
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,639
there is some historical precedent for

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,160
in the intelligence world

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
sending messages via newspaper

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
classifieds and there was actually an

223
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
episode of the modern rogue recently

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
where they showed how this works so

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,199
operatives or spies or secret agents

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,319
will

227
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,680
pay for newspaper classifieds to be

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
published that way you can send a

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
message to someone without having any

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,399
direct

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
contact with them

232
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
as far as the digital world is concerned

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
now we're talking about

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,440
how to make noise

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
in a file work for us so we can

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,600
store information in the slack space of

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
files

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
or as far as the way images work

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
we can kind of sprinkle things

240
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
throughout the file

241
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
which does degrade the quality of the uh

242
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,800
the host file or the cover file but

243
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
usually to such degree that it's so

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
small that nobody

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
could really detect it just by looking

246
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
at it it's possible to do this with

247
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,519
sound files also

248
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
there are some really cool capture the

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
flag competitions that

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
you have to look at the like um

251
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
the spectrogram of a mp3 file

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
and you could see things written using

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
frequencies

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,959
that's really cool uh another way that's

255
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
common is to comment out text right like

256
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
if you've ever

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
looked at a web app hacking challenge

258
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,959
first thing you do is look at the source

259
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
code and look for things that have been

260
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,760
commented out

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
that's a way to hide a message in plain

262
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
sight or even just using different

263
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,720
colored text

264
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,399
so sometimes you may get a challenge

265
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
where it's just a blank document

266
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
hit control a and see if there is any

267
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,680
white text

268
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
that's being obscured right

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
fractionalized comments we know that

270
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
when certain malware payloads are sent

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
or data is being x-filled that

272
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
chunking the file into pieces is a

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
common way to

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
to hide something so the same thing can

275
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
be done with steganography

276
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
i mentioned the audio signals and the

277
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
spectro

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
control characters uh non-printing

279
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,880
unicode characters

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
there's there's just there are dozens

281
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,079
and dozens of ways

282
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,120
to implement this principle right so the

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
possibilities are almost endless

284
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
um it's i've heard

285
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
from different articles that i've read

286
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
and from different people that work in

287
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
intelligence that i know that

288
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,760
terrorists and spies in the world right

289
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,079
now

290
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,240
use steganography and they embed

291
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,800
messages and images and they post those

292
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
on image sharing sites

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
and if you think about it there there

294
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
are hundreds of

295
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
image sharing sites like imgur and those

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
kind of places and

297
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,519
millions and billions of images are

298
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,800
being stored every day

299
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
there just really isn't a practical way

300
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
to screen for steganography

301
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,480
so it's kind of it's a great way for

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
those people to send messages

303
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
before we move on i just think it's

304
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
important to

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
to get into the philosophy of

306
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
steganography

307
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
you know the cryptographers were so

308
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,079
preoccupied

309
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,200
preoccupied with whether they could they

310
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
didn't stop to think if they should

311
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,519
okay

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,279
so now i'm gonna switch to a workflow

313
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,480
demo i have a few

314
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
sample files hopefully this

315
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
works okay let me check

316
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,639
obs here cool so now you're looking at

317
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
my parrot os system here

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
i have my notes file i have my samples

319
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,279
here

320
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,240
and then i have a terminal so hopefully

321
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
you'll be able to follow along

322
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,040
if you want uh these sample files

323
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
just hit me up in slack or on twitter

324
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,839
afterwards

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,720
this workflow comes from a white paper

326
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,519
that i wrote back in 2018 before

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
i had done anything in the world of

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
cyber security one of the first things i

329
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
published

330
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,480
was uh looking at stake analysis

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,160
and i explored a potential workflow

332
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
and i consulted some other people who

333
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,519
were a little bit better at stake

334
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
analysis than i am i don't claim to be a

335
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,399
professional

336
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,079
i'm just the guy who likes crypto

337
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
challenges and alternate reality puzzles

338
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
so

339
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
this is my basic workflow like i said

340
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,680
this is

341
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
meant for people who are doing

342
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
capture the flag competition cyber

343
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
competitions mostly student level

344
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
this is not high level stake analysis

345
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,160
but if you look here at my list

346
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
this is my basic workflow first step

347
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,519
just

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,600
actually look at the image see if

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,839
there's anything obvious about it

350
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,920
sometimes these challenges will have

351
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
text that's just

352
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
pasted onto the image just really small

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
or hidden in a place that you wouldn't

354
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
notice at first glance

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
sometimes the image itself will have

356
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
clues about

357
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
what algorithm was being used or what

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,440
tool was used

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,680
to embed the uh the the message

360
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
the second thing i like to do is take a

361
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
look at strings and strings here i'm

362
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
gonna go to my terminal here i'm going

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,959
to type what is

364
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,839
strings if you don't know about what is

365
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,399
it's a

366
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,160
great little way to get a one-liner

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
about tools in linux

368
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,199
so strings prints the sequence of

369
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
printable characters in a files that's

370
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
really nice for us to do

371
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
the second thing that i like to do is

372
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
use the exif tool

373
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
exit tool reads and writes metadata

374
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
there are some really

375
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,240
great websites that show metadata um

376
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
but that you can use also and i'll show

377
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,680
an example of how that works

378
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
uh the next thing i like to run is bin

379
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
walk

380
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
so this is a tool that searches binary

381
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
images for embedded files

382
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,959
really convenient um it's a great go-to

383
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
i'm going to show how all these work

384
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
uh if that if that doesn't work then i

385
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
will go to i don't know if there's a

386
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,199
what is for stake solve

387
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
no so stake solve is a tool that allows

388
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,040
you to flip

389
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,199
through different layers of the image

390
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,720
and i'll show that also

391
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
and then the sixth one is the digital

392
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
invisible ink tool kit

393
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
that's a really common tool that's used

394
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
by a lot of ctfs and i have examples of

395
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:41,519
that

396
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,399
and then if those six things my first

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
go-to's don't work

398
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
then i'll jump over to other tools i'll

399
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
take a look at stakehide or i'll look

400
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
for stegotools online

401
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,920
or i might have to consult someone who's

402
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
good at coding and they can write a

403
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,240
script that might be able to

404
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
to find the information that i'm looking

405
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
for so

406
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,439
let's go ahead and clear this

407
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
and let's see what we have here so i

408
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
have

409
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
five files that i'm going to take a look

410
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
at let's take a look at stego one

411
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
so the first thing i'm going to do is

412
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,800
i'm just going to look at the image

413
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,720
let's see okay

414
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
so we have we have a batman coin very

415
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,560
cool

416
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
he's doing the bat 2c all right

417
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,360
now i'm going to go back over to my

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
terminal here and i'm just going to run

419
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,199
strings

420
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,759
strings will output a lot of information

421
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
sometimes

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,600
so it's helpful to pipe that to more

423
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
and that kind of gives you a little bit

424
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,680
of control now if you look here

425
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,240
hopefully it's visible on the screen

426
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
okay good

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,680
you can see that there was a string that

428
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
was found right at the top

429
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,480
in the exif data mural labs you did it

430
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
gg

431
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
so pretty easy to find um stuff that's

432
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,720
hidden in the metadata like that

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
i'm not going to go through any i can i

434
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
can show you if i scroll through

435
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,279
the strings but i'm going to i'm going

436
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,639
to go ahead and close that

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
and i'm i'm going to just show you what

438
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,839
it looks like with the exif tool

439
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
and you can see here under image

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
description

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
i put in this string so that's probably

442
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,040
your most

443
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
basic kind of steganography challenge

444
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
there

445
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,079
let's take a look at stay go to so i'm

446
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
going to go through the workflow

447
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,800
for each one in the exact same way

448
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
so stego2 and i totally stole

449
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
all these different images and different

450
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,399
samples from all over the internet if

451
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
you want attribution just let me know

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
afterwards i forgot to do that for the

453
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,160
talk

454
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
okay very cool uh fantasy uh someone in

455
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
the chat let me know what this is a

456
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
reference to because i do not know

457
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
let's go back over to my terminal i'm

458
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,319
going to run strings

459
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,240
stigo2 type that to more

460
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
okay we can see some alphabets there

461
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,520
i'm just going to flip through here

462
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
okay i'm not seeing anything super

463
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,280
obvious

464
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,799
it doesn't mean that it's not there

465
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
but i know that it's not because i made

466
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
this demo

467
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
now we'll try the exif tool

468
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
okay let's just look through this uh

469
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
nothing

470
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
nothing here that's jumping out like i

471
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
said there are other online access tools

472
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
that are a little bit better and can get

473
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,080
a little bit deeper

474
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
this is just your basic stuff here okay

475
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
so now let's go on to bin walk

476
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
okay so i can see and i know it's a

477
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,799
little bit

478
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
it's like kind of going wrapping around

479
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
this line here but there is a zip

480
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
archive within this jpeg

481
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,039
so a cool thing about um

482
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,200
about bin walk is it has like the

483
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
built-in capabilities of extracting

484
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
already known file types so if i do dash

485
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,559
e for extract run this

486
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
okay and now if i i can see that there

487
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
is the zip archive if i go over to my

488
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
folder here

489
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,919
i can i now have a stego2.jpg.extracted2

490
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,960
items

491
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,440
if i go in there now i have another

492
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
image

493
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
so a layered a challenge is very common

494
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
um i can i can go through all of the

495
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,918
uh the same workflow for this

496
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,080
but i won't so i'm going to go into this

497
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
folder here and i'm going to run bin

498
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
walk again

499
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,678
on my new image

500
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
and i can see that there is something

501
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,840
also embedded within this file

502
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,199
so i'm going to do dash e to extract

503
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
and we have another output so let's go

504
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,760
back over here

505
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
dig a little bit deeper now it's pulled

506
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
out a text file for us if i open that

507
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
then we have this hash and this hash is

508
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
going to be the flag that's being looked

509
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,640
for

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
so pretty cool

511
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
let me go back here let's go back over

512
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
to my terminal

513
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,799
all right let me clear this

514
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
all right number three

515
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,960
so let's start uh with our workflow

516
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
okay so this looks like the the un

517
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,840
logo right

518
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,720
we'll run strings on it

519
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,480
i think we're on three now

520
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
i know i'm in the wrong folder

521
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
there we go

522
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
okay um we could go through

523
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,799
this it doesn't look like we're going to

524
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,840
find anything

525
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,959
here check the exif tool

526
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,280
nothing interesting here let's try bin

527
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
walk

528
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,120
okay this is all normal this is the way

529
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
png files work

530
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
so now what we're going to do is we're

531
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
going to try the next tool in our list

532
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,120
which is stakes off

533
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
and it's just a java file

534
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
so now what we do is we do open

535
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,200
stego3 and now what we can do

536
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
is we can use these arrows here to flip

537
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
through the different layers

538
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
so this is the color inversion or the

539
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
xor

540
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,760
alpha plane 7 six

541
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,360
five four

542
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
oh there we go alpha plane two if you

543
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,919
can see here on the bottom left

544
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
flag you can't see moi

545
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,799
so there we go boom i love when uh ctfs

546
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
have challenges like this because it's

547
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,679
cool to see

548
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,360
things stored in different layers like

549
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,120
that so that one's done

550
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
great

551
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,760
and now we're on number four

552
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
so add let's see what are we how are we

553
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,880
for time

554
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,919
i think we're good okay

555
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
let's start with our workflow so let's

556
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,720
go take a look at number four

557
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
okay looks like a cool beach

558
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,080
with a per people in the water there

559
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
i'm going to run strings

560
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
okay this is a little bit more

561
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,720
interesting here

562
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
so we definitely can see that something

563
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
is going on

564
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,919
that's not in plain english so it's not

565
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,720
helpful to us

566
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,000
let's check the exif tool just to

567
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
keep reinforcing the workflow

568
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,158
nothing here let's try bin walk

569
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
okay there's some weird header

570
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
information here

571
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,320
um we can try stake solve but i'm not

572
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,799
going to

573
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,799
do that because i know it's wrong but

574
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,400
now we're going to move on to the

575
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
digital invisible ink tool kit

576
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,880
this is a little bit more exciting

577
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
okay so this is how this works you can

578
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,280
use most of these tools to also encode

579
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,440
we're going to switch to the decode tab

580
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
here and we're going to pick the image

581
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,200
to decode

582
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,640
so now we're on stago 4. for we're going

583
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,280
to

584
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,799
set a message file to route right to

585
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
so if it finds something we'll just set

586
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
it to out

587
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,200
whoops

588
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,960
okay here we go

589
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
now what we do here is we select

590
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
algorithms um

591
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,360
there are six here i usually start with

592
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,480
the first one

593
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
hit go

594
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,400
error and it's okay you just hit okay

595
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,080
and then you try the next one

596
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,679
and sometimes you have to go through all

597
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,360
these until you find the right one there

598
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,840
are

599
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
options to further complicate this but

600
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
generally for ctfs and challenges that

601
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
you'll be working on

602
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,240
it'll just be default let's do blind

603
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
hide okay so that says success

604
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
message was retrieved so if i go over to

605
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,039
my stego folder

606
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,000
i now have an out file and there's a

607
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
flag in there

608
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,840
flag blind hide so not too hard there

609
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
and then the last one is this one

610
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,400
okay so this is

611
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
uh an example of steganography using a

612
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
stegosaurus

613
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
this one is i want to call attention to

614
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
the text here

615
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,480
why the tyrant king george of course

616
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
not only is that an excellent office

617
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,600
reference

618
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
but it's a clue that leads you to the

619
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
proper tool to extract the information

620
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,760
that you need from this

621
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
there are there are dozens and dozens of

622
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,279
steganography tools

623
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
all using different algorithms and

624
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
different ways to hide data

625
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
it can be very difficult to solve these

626
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
challenges if you're not a strong coder

627
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
especially like i am

628
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,679
knowing the tool is very important

629
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,279
so what we can do here is let me pull up

630
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,679
a browser and hopefully this doesn't

631
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,039
kill my vm

632
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,000
like it did earlier

633
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,960
and we we could do all the uh the steps

634
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
in the workflow but we're just gonna

635
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
skip to the end here

636
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,960
now i made this particular uh

637
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
stegosaurus steganography challenge

638
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
uh for like a twitter challenge that i

639
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
did

640
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,240
the what i wanted people to do while

641
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,720
looking at that clue

642
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,159
is to google george

643
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,840
steganography

644
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,880
online because there are specific online

645
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,279
tools

646
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
all right let's give this a second i've

647
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
been having trouble with the browser

648
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,640
within my parrot vm i have no idea why

649
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,279
super slow

650
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,960
okay so if you search for george which

651
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
is the reference

652
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,840
in the image it finds this which is

653
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
stageonline.georgeom.com

654
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,039
so let's pull that up uh what i thought

655
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,400
this was going to be very obvious to

656
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
find but it wasn't so if you are the

657
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
kind of person who likes to make crypto

658
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,720
challenges or ctf challenges

659
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
be careful with that let me select

660
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,640
here we go i'm going to

661
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:07,440
upload the file

662
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,799
and if you notice the file name 1r

663
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,520
2g 3b that'll be important later

664
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,840
all right so it's loading the image

665
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,679
okay so now what you do with this tool

666
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,840
is click extract files or data

667
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
and now that file name here's where that

668
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,000
becomes important

669
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,919
so i'm going to select r1 g2

670
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
b3 scroll down

671
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:49,840
click go

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,799
here we go okay boom now you can see

673
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,159
here in the results

674
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,520
flag you got a golden ticket so pretty

675
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
pretty cool i thought so all right so

676
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
that's

677
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,120
it for the demo

678
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
all right so what we'll do now to

679
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,640
continue the tour it looks like i still

680
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
have a little bit of time left

681
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,559
let's go ahead and take a look at some

682
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,399
stegosauruses i can see here from

683
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,840
the console that everything's fine

684
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
looks like the cars are unarmed but i'm

685
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,240
sure that's okay

686
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,120
you know life finds a way as they say so

687
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
stegosaurus from the greek stegos

688
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,640
which means roof and soros

689
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,120
which means lizard so technically these

690
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
are roof lizards i'm not sure what that

691
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,559
means but it's a thing

692
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,760
um they are from the genus herbivorous

693
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,600
thyrophorin dinosaur

694
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
and i do know that there is a

695
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,960
paleontologist listening to me right now

696
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,679
and i apologize

697
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,480
excruciatingly um

698
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320
fossils of this genus date to the late

699
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,600
jurassic period

700
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
fun fact the tail spike has the coolest

701
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,799
name

702
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,760
phagomizer and i know that from a far

703
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,840
side comic

704
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,760
stegosaurus uh existed between 155

705
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,120
to 150 million years ago

706
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
mostly located in the western united

707
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
states and portugal

708
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
they were large heavily built

709
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
herbivorous quadrupeds

710
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
with rounded backs short forelimbs

711
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
long hind limbs and tails held high in

712
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,200
the air

713
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,360
it's actually debated and i'll let the

714
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,720
paleontologists weigh in on this

715
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
more specifically but the the debate in

716
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,080
the

717
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
paleontology world is whether the tail

718
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,360
or the

719
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,240
thagomizer was used for offensive or

720
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
defensive use or maybe just

721
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
as a cool display like hey i got a cool

722
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
tail

723
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,520
so the function of the array of plates

724
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
and spikes

725
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,279
like i said it's been the subject of

726
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
much speculation

727
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,919
among scientists generally agreed that

728
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,240
the tails were for defense but

729
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
their plates may have been for display

730
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
and also could provide thermoregulatory

731
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,720
functions

732
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,840
and yeah how badass is that okay

733
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,200
stegosaurus had a relatively low brain

734
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,720
to body mass ratio had a short neck

735
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
and a small head meaning most likely

736
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,559
eight low-lying bushes

737
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,200
and shrubs

738
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,559
okay uh how are we doing uh

739
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,240
on time right now are we good

740
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:32,240
you're good great

741
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,880
just a couple more stock images uh just

742
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,600
wanting to

743
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
get a full appreciation for the

744
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
stegosaurus

745
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,960
in all its glory i don't care what

746
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,840
anyone says this is the coolest dinosaur

747
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,640
[Music]

748
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,080
oh okay um some something is happening

749
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,559
here

750
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,360
we're gonna head back for the after tour

751
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,600
pancakes but

752
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,519
some something's going on i'm sure it's

753
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,760
just a technical issue i wouldn't worry

754
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,880
about it there

755
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
we have a lot of clever girls working

756
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
for us today so

757
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,279
uh let me go ahead and pull up one of my

758
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,200
terminals here in the controller let's

759
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
see if i can fix this

760
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
don't worry and uh we we can discuss

761
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,240
sexism in survival situations when when

762
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,519
i get back so

763
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,519
here we go security

764
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,279
security grid no nexus

765
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,320
i'll go ahead and reboot this machine

766
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
and we'll we'll be just fine don't worry

767
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
about anything

768
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,440
there all right

769
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
well uh if there are any questions from

770
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
the chat this would be a great time for

771
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,080
them

772
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,240
you know when you gotta go you gotta go

773
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,679
um that's my

774
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
talk i really hope you enjoyed your tour

775
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,039
today please

776
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,360
thank you for not suing us here at

777
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
pancakes park

778
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,799
thank you leslie and thank you to

779
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,559
everyone

780
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,760
i think the top question was is this hat

781
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
standard attire

782
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
or is it just for today's showing no

783
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
this this is my

784
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,840
uh pancakes park uniform it's uh our

785
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
our our illustrious leader leslie she

786
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,159
spared no expense

787
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,919
on uniforms and i am required as a

788
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,480
technician here for the park to to wear

789
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,000
this

790
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,440
it's lovely um also

791
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,720
any any tips for anyone who has trouble

792
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,000
um using um

793
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
let's see what was it

794
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
your uh your sixth i don't have the list

795
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
up your sixth

796
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,760
tool in the list uh the digital

797
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,000
invisible ink tool kit

798
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,480
okay we can take a look at it yeah

799
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,200
sometimes you know steganography

800
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,520
you know i get a lot of new students and

801
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,119
in the classes that i teach

802
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,480
i generally like to require them to

803
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,159
either participate in the national cyber

804
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,639
league or some type of cyber competition

805
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,480
just so they can get some experience

806
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,520
be exposed to some different domains

807
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,879
that they're not used to

808
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,960
maybe maybe find something that they

809
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
didn't know they'd be interested in

810
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,239
a hard subject is cryptography

811
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,040
and or codes and ciphers we have to we

812
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
have to differentiate between

813
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
like cryptography with a capital c

814
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
people with phds who spend their whole

815
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,119
careers doing that

816
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,839
uh very math heavy and then i guess what

817
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,839
could be called cryptology

818
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,359
codes and ciphers a lot of being

819
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,159
good at this type of stuff is just

820
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
getting experience

821
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,599
like we're in the middle of the

822
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,520
preseason for national cyber league

823
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,240
right now and my students are working on

824
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
different cryptography challenges and

825
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
for myself i go through and i look at

826
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
them and i know how to solve them all

827
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
just by looking at them because i

828
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,320
have so much experience that i can

829
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,160
recognize when particular ciphers are

830
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,440
being used or

831
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,680
i can see a weird code or cipher that's

832
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,599
very obscure

833
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,440
part of that has to do with just getting

834
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,359
experience and

835
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,359
practicing the same thing goes for

836
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,880
steganography

837
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
my workflow here is by no means

838
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,160
exhaustive and it's

839
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
it may not even be the best one it's

840
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,720
just the one that i like to follow

841
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,359
um i try to go for all the low hanging

842
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,119
fruit first and then get deeper and

843
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,240
deeper

844
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,720
generally if it's if it gets to this

845
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,440
point and i can't find it

846
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,839
it's tough as far as going into the

847
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,800
options here

848
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
and changing these different bits and

849
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,240
doing lsb matching i don't generally see

850
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
that a lot

851
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
in ctfs or crypto challenges it's

852
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,440
generally

853
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,079
pretty basic here there are ways to run

854
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,800
analysis

855
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
i'm i'm not even sure what this means so

856
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
like

857
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,760
like i said this is a this is a very

858
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,079
math heavy domain i'm just kind of a

859
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,119
noob when it comes to it

860
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,119
let's see what happens i can i can run

861
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,480
an analysis here

862
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
and if you're a math major or a real

863
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,599
heavy coder

864
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,640
then this is probably meaningful to you

865
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,359
for myself i generally if i'm at this

866
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,400
point i'm generally

867
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,040
it's a little guessy um and i will just

868
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,560
go through and try the different um

869
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,160
algorithms and see what it finds so

870
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,839
hopefully that that answers the question

871
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,640
excellent and then another question was

872
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
for the for the alert at the end

873
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,599
um was that a program or a game or did

874
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,640
you create that or

875
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,920
how did that come about oh oh

876
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,680
let me see if i can scroll back do you

877
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,440
mean

878
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
this uh this console here

879
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
this is uh this is a website that i

880
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
actually uh

881
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,920
if you go look for it online it's like

882
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,839
the jurassic park

883
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,359
console simulator and it goes through

884
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:15,760
the

885
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,880
scene from the movie here

886
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,560
it's like a kind of a prank site that

887
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
you can send out

888
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,400
excellent

889
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,960
say the magic word

890
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
all right i know i kind of got through

891
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
that a little bit faster and i

892
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
definitely apologize because i don't

893
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,839
want to screw up the schedule

894
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,800
um any other questions about

895
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,599
cyber security maybe people who are

896
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,320
students

897
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
who are wanting to get into cyber

898
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,079
security

899
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,240
um any anything like that's fine

900
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
has it has anyone heard of the term

901
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,680
thagomizer before

902
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,359
isn't that the kind of like the best

903
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,440
name for a thing yeah i think that was

904
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,119
a lot of people's first time hearing

905
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,440
that really thank you for sharing

906
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
yeah i got that from let me see if i can

907
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
uh

908
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,599
if i search for thagomizer

909
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,359
yeah i think it's i think i think it was

910
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,359
originally coined by

911
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,560
gary larson who is the uh

912
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,320
the artist for whoops

913
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,599
the far side now this

914
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,000
end is called the phagomizer after the

915
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,280
late thag cements

916
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,960
so if i grew up um in the 80s and 90s

917
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,320
and i used to sit with my grandma and

918
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
read the newspaper in the morning and

919
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,839
she would read the important parts and i

920
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,920
would read the comic section

921
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
and the far side was always one of my

922
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
huge favorites so

923
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,720
anything gary larson is is his classic

924
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,839
comedy

925
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,160
consensus is if you knew that reference

926
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,200
you might be old

927
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,480
dude i'm so old yeah i'm in my 40s now

928
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,280
so i'm like

929
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
ancient when it comes to i.t and tech

930
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,760
for sure

931
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,599
um a cute a father a couple other

932
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,640
comments were um you know it's a it's a

933
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
bummer when you're doing a ctf

934
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,440
and you you find images are either not

935
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,359
um steganography or they are and you did

936
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,240
something different

937
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
are there any good ways to like kind of

938
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,720
try to determine that

939
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,000
in the first couple minutes so you don't

940
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,040
waste a lot of time yeah i mean like

941
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
i had i had a student i had a student

942
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
actually come across this exact problem

943
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,200
and the domain they were looking at for

944
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
national cyber league was the ocean

945
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,839
domain

946
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,880
so the images there are meant to provide

947
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,560
visual clues to

948
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
to be able to to look something up

949
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,680
online to find

950
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,240
an address and they thought just because

951
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,800
it was an

952
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
image maybe there was something deeper

953
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,160
going on there so

954
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
that is a classic trap that happens it's

955
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,440
kind of like your red herring or

956
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,359
a lot of people they overthink these

957
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,599
challenges and

958
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,359
yeah i would say that consider the

959
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,839
context before you get too deep with any

960
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,359
steganography

961
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,079
if it's a image provided for an ocean

962
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,400
challenge or for something else

963
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,359
or if the image itself just has a code

964
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,280
on it or has something that's really

965
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,240
obvious

966
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
you probably don't need to get into the

967
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
workflow

968
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,359
but if it's an image provided in the

969
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
domain is cryptography or steganography

970
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,079
well then it's pretty obvious so

971
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
just consider the context and always

972
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,359
look for the obvious things first like

973
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,200
my first thing is to always look at the

974
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,079
image to see

975
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,359
exactly what's on it first and then

976
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,760
get deeper and deeper but only if that

977
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,680
if i know it's within

978
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,759
an appropriate context

979
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
got it and then um would you like to

980
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,720
leave

981
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,880
us with one of your favorite sites for

982
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,160
steganography challenges

983
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,119
yeah that's that's tough because i don't

984
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,839
really ha

985
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,079
i mean one of my favorite sites that i

986
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,400
like to point people to when it comes to

987
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,040
getting into ctfs would be picoctf

988
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,880
that's a free one and there's a pico gym

989
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,079
i took most of these examples that i

990
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,119
found just by

991
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,960
googling and stig analysis is kind of

992
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,440
a very it's kind of hard to find a lot

993
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
of good information about it it's

994
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,359
it's a very like kind of spooky

995
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,599
mysterious domain within

996
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,720
cryptography so either

997
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
it's either really low level content

998
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,640
like i presented here or it gets

999
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,760
super high level mathematics technical

1000
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,119
calculus really fast so it's hard to

1001
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,520
find

1002
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,800
examples of this like i said i can

1003
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
i can jump in the chat later and

1004
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
share the links of the different sites

1005
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,839
that i found the samples that i used

1006
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,760
here some of them i just made myself

1007
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
with the tools so i could demo the

1008
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,240
decoding of it

1009
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,319
yeah it's tough national cyber league

1010
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,000
for those of you who are in high school

1011
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,359
or college

1012
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,040
